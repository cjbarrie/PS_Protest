AB This article discusses two meta-analyses on randomized response technique (RRT) studies, the first on 6 individual validation studies and the second on 32 comparative studies. The meta-analyses focus on the performance of RRTs compared to conventional question-and-answer methods. The authors use the percentage of incorrect answers as effect size for the individual validation studies and the standardized difference score (d-probit) as effect size for the comparative studies. Results indicate that compared to other methods, randomized response designs result in more valid data. For the individual validation studies, the mean percentage of incorrect answers for the RRT condition is .38; for the other conditions, it is .49. The more sensitive the topic under investigation, the higher the validity of RRT results. However, both meta-analyses have Unexplained residual variances across studies, which indicates that RRTs are not completely under the control of the researcher.

AB This article considers one way to construct "analytic" narratives in historical sociology. The author grounds his approach in ongoing methodological debates over temporality and sequence in historical processes and the assumed trade-off between historical particularity and causal generality He promotes narratives that exploit both the sequential/ eventful and contextual properties of analytic time, with an approach that combines and builds on two emerging developments in narrative methodology: the use of rational choice theory and the idea of "increasing returns" in path-dependent historical processes. While doing narrative in this way will not be appropriate for analyzing all historical processes, it can be a useful methodological strategy for many of the questions, events, and outcomes that interest historical sociologists. The author draws oil his own research program on early equal employment law in the mid- to late 1960s to illustrate how this method can work in practice.

ID EARNINGS; SALARIES
AB The authors address a methodological issue in estimating pay penalties to women professionals-whether the dependent variable in the pay equation should be hourly wage or earnings measured over some other period such as weeks, months, or a year The authors analyze data on college graduates working in professional specialty occupations and on physicians, and they report two main conclusions. First, the appropriate specification of the pay equation for (employed) professionals is with ln(earnings) as the dependent variable with ln(hours) included as an independent variable. Second, the implications of using this specification for estimates of gender pay differentials are serious. In the data on professionals, respecification of the pay equation changes the estimate of the pay penalty to women from -4.6 to -7.6 percent. In the data on physicians, it changes the estimate from no penalty to a very large one, from -1.8 to -13.0 percent.

DE latent growth curve model; autoregressive latent trajectory model;
   autoregression; structural equation modeling
AB Curran and Bollen combined two models for longitudinal panel data: the latent growth curve model and the autoregressive model. In their model, the autoregressive relationships are modeled between the observed variables. This is a different model than a latent growth curve model with autoregressive relationships between the disturbances. However, when the autoregressive parameter p is invariant over time and lies between -1 and 1, it can be shown that these models are algebraically equivalent. This result can be shown to generalize to the multivariate case. When the autoregressive parameters in the autoregressive latent trajectory model vary over time, the equivalence between the autoregressive latent trajectory model and a latent growth curve model with autoregressive disturbances no longer holds. However, a latent growth curve model with time-varying autoregressive parameters for the disturbances could be considered an interesting alternative to the autoregressive latent trajectory model with time-varying autoregressive parameters.

AB The concept of set inclusion has remained insufficiently developed in the fuzzy set literature to be of much use to social scientists. However, a fully fledged concept of fuzzy set inclusion, along with appropriate statistical methods for evaluating it, could be very useful in the social sciences. This article combines fuzzy set and statistical methods, in the form of a cumulative distribution-based approach to evaluating fuzzy set inclusion without making strong assumptions about measurement levels. It establishes criteria for distinguishing an "inclusion relation" from independence plus skew as well as from other kinds of relationships. A measure of inclusion is developed that is sensitive to the degree to which individual cases violate a strict inclusion rule. A technique for modeling localized inclusion relations in contingency tables and scatter plots is also presented. Finally, the connections between the fuzzy set approach to set inclusion and mainstream statistical techniques are briefly adumbrated.

AB This article provides a largely nontechnical discussion of the acquisition of membership values in fuzzy set analyses. First the basic properties of a membership are discussed. Then the three common strategies of membership assignment-direct subjective assignment, indirect subjective assignment, and transformation-are critically examined in turn. Examples are used to illustrate the techniques. The connection with existing psychometric and statistical methods is particularly emphasized, focusing on the notion of a membership value as a random variable as a means to assess uncertainty in assignment.

AB Two-level theories explain outcomes with causal variables at two levels of analysis that are systematically related to one another Although nearly prominent scholars in the field of comparative analysis have developed two-level theories, the empirical and methodological issues that these theories raise have yet to be investigated. In this article, the authors explore different structures of two-level theories and consider the issues involved in testing these theories with fuzzy-set methods. They show that grasping the overall structure of two-level theories requires both specifying the particular type of relationship that exists between and within levels of analysis and specifying the logical linkages between levels in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions. They at-glee that for the purposes of testing these theories, fuzzy-set analysis provides a powerful set of tools. However, to realize this potential, investigators using fuzzy-set methods must be clear about the two-level structure of their theories from the onset.

   versus regression analysis
SO SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE colonialism; development; necessary causes; sufficient causes
AB This article evaluates the relative strengths and weaknesses of fuzzy-set analysis and regression analysis for explaining the "great reversal" in Spanish America. From 1750 to 1900, the most marginal colonial territories often became the region's wealthiest countries, whereas the most central colonial territories often became the region's poorest countries. To explain this reversal, five competing hypotheses are tested using both regression and fuzzy-set methods. The fuzzy-set analysis reaches substantively important conclusions, finding that strong liberal factions are probabilistically necessary for economic development and that dense indigenous populations are probabilistically necessary for social underdevelopment. By contrast, the regression analysis generates findings that are not meaningful. The article concludes that fuzzy-set analysis and regression analysis operate in different "causal universes" and that greater attention should be granted to the causal universe occupied by fuzzy-set analysis.

ID SMOOTHING SPLINE MODELS; BAYESIAN MODEL
AB Many questions in social research must be evaluated over time. For example, in studies of intragenerational mobility, measuring opportunity for economic advancement requires longitudinal data. The authors develop and use a class of hybrid functional models to demonstrate how different models can lead to extremely different substantive conclusions. They provide guidelines for longitudinal data analyses in which variance partitions are central to the inquiry. In their analysis of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, the authors conclude that in a period of rising wage dispersion, the bulk of inequality is persistent over the life course. Their models provide support for the scenario in which wage inequality rises steadily while instability slowly diminishes over time. They obtain mild evidence of increased wage instability for somewhat older workers in the early 1990s, matching a recessionary trend. These findings contribute significantly to understanding wage inequality in United States over the past 25 years.

AB What is the correlation between two variables? Traditional answers offer summary assessments such as Pearson's r and regression coefficients. But new computing techniques make it possible to construct conceptually simple hypotheses that describe the full joint distribution of two variables, making it possible to "mine" the correlation for information that was previously unused. This article begins with evidence of systematic anomalies in the empirical joint distribution of height-weight data and follows with a hypothesis that explains these anomalies in terms of a theoretical joint distribution relative to a linear equation. The hypothesis has serious consequences because even in traditional examples, while it offers an improved fit to the data, its estimates of the linear center do not correspond to traditional least squares estimates of the linear relation for the same two variables.

AB The authors studs, alternative estimators of the impacts of higher level variables in multilevel models. This is important since many of the important variables in social science research are higher level factors having impacts oil many lower level outcomes such as school achievement and contraceptive use. While the large sample properties of alternative estimators for these models are well known, there is little evidence about the relative performance of these estimators in the sample sizes typical in social science research. The authors attempt to fill this gap by presenting evidence about point estimation and standard error estimation for both two- and three-level models. A major conclusion of the article is that readily available commercial software call be used to obtain both reliable point estimates and coefficient standard errors in models with two or more levels as long as appropriate corrections are made for possible error correlations at the highest level.

ID OCCUPATIONAL SEX SEGREGATION; UNITED-STATES; ODDS RATIOS;

AB Comparative studies of occupational sex segregation have employed a variety of measures to estimate the extent of segregation across labor markets. In this article, the authors focus on two intrinsic limitations of the ratio index, which is derived from the log-linear framework: singularity for totally segregated occupations and sensitivity near the extremes. To capture the real essence of gender occupational segregation, it is necessary to examine rather detailed occupational categories. Such detailed occupational classification poses a problem for the ratio index since small occupations are more likely to be mono-gender occupations. The authors propose an alternative modified index that resolves both the singularity and the sensitivity problems by, employing the 'first-order approximation" of the logarithmic function. The modified index makes it possible to compute measures of microsegregation for detailed occupational categories. The advantages of the proposed index for comparative microsegregation analyses are illustrated and discussed.

ID HISTORICAL SOCIOLOGY; EXPLANATION; EVENTS
AB As originally developed by Charles Ragin in The Comparative Method (1987), qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) has been used extensively by comparative and historical sociologists as an effective tool for analyzing data sets of medium-N populations. Like many other methods, however, QCA is a temporal and obscures the sequential nature of paths of causation. QCA ignores the order of events by treating combinations of attributes as though they occur simultaneously rather than as unfolding over time. While preserving the essential strengths of QCA, the authors present a modification that is capable of capturing the temporal nature of causal interactions. This modification involves a hybrid of Boolean algebra and sequence analysis to create a parsimonious set of solutions. This technique is referred to as temporal qualitative comparative analysis, or TQCA.

AB The increasing diversity of immigrant-receiving countries calls for measures of residential segregation that extend beyond the conventional two-group approach. The authors represent simultaneously the relative social distance occupied by a wide array of ethnic groups. They use census tract tabulations for the Toronto Consolidated Metropolitan Area in 1996 and the technique of multidimensional scaling to summarize the residential neighborhood pattern of the city's largest 50 ethnic groups. From the two-dimensional multidimensional scaling configuration, the authors find that African/Caribbean groups and blacks were highly clustered and shared common patterns of segregation with other groups. This study highlights the value of looking beyond broad racial or panethnic classifications in understanding ethnic congregation and residential segregation patterns. The results also demonstrate the merits of this method in providing a more conceptually meaningful way to understand social distance among groups.

AB This article outlines a research strategy for studying difficult-to-reach migrant populations that combines community collaboration, targeted random sampling, and parallel sampling in sending and receiving areas. The authors describe how this methodology was applied to the study of gender, migration, and HIV risks among Hispanic migrants in Durham, North Carolina. They illustrate the usefulness of community collaboration for informing survey design and providing a contextual understanding of research findings. They likewise demonstrate the importance of parallel sampling and assess the bias that would have resulted from conducting their study with convenience samples as opposed to a targeted random sampling technique. While the authors describe its application to HIV risks among Hispanic migrants, the methodology can easily be extended to other migrant groups as well as to other sensitive topics pertaining to migration and social adaptation.

AB The maximum likelihood (ML) method, based on the normal distribution assumption, is widely used in mean and covariance structure analysis. With typical nonnormal data, the ML method will lead to biased statistics and inappropriate scientific conclusions. This article develops a simple but informative case to show how ML results are influenced by skewness and kurtosis. Specifically, the authors discuss how skewness and kurtosis in a univariate distribution affect the standard errors of the ML estimators, the covariances between the estimators, and the likelihood ratio test of hypotheses on mean and variance parameters. They also describe corrections that have been developed to allow appropriate inference. Enough details are provided so that this material can be used in graduate instruction. For each result, the corresponding results in the higher dimensional case are pointed out, and references are provided.

AB The problem of statistical inference in inequality research has persisted despite the solutions long suggested by asymptotic theory. This article provides a thorough analysis of the theoretical and practical aspects of conducting statistical inference in the context of inequality data. Using the income surveys of the Luxembourg Income Study, the article outlines in detail the new bootstrap procedures, assesses their performance, and demonstrates their effectiveness in evaluating levels and trends in cross-national inequality. It provides an analytical evaluation of current advancements in inequality measurement and for the first time applies these methods in the context of comparative research, but it also can be used as practical guide for handling the problems of statistical inference in more general social scientific settings.

AB This article develops a unified framework, based on Rossi's factorial survey method, for studying positive beliefs and normative judgments. The framework enables estimation of individuals' positive-belief and normative-judgment equations, leading to analysis of the components of beliefs and judgments, assessment of interpersonal variability in the components, and estimation of two further equations, representing, respectively, the determinants and consequences of the components. We describe procedures for data collection, assemble a set of tools for estimating the positive-belief and normative-judgment equations and carrying out the corresponding homogeneity tests, and propose ways of estimating the determinants and consequences equations. To illustrate the framework, we investigate both a positive-belief equation (describing adolescents' views concerning determination of marital happiness) and a normative-judgment equation (describing judgments of the justice of earnings). This article thus provides a guide to contemporary factorial survey analysis, and points the way to its further development.

AB A wildly discussed shortcoming of panel surveys is a potential bias arising from selective attrition. Based on data of the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP), the authors analyze potential artifacts (level, structure, income inequality) by comparing results for two independently drawn panel subsamples started in 1984 and 2000. They apply ANOGI (analysis of Gini) techniques, the equivalent of ANOVA performed with the Gini coefficient. They rearrange, reinterpret, and use the decomposition in the comparison of subpopulations from which the different samples were drawn. Taking into account indicators for income, significant differences between these two samples with respect to income inequality are found in the first year which start to fade away in Wave 2 and disappear in Wave 3. The authors find credible indication for these differences to be driven by changes in response behavior of short-term panel members rather than by attrition among members of the longer running sample.

AB No explained variation (R-2) measure for ordinal response models enjoys wide use, and such measures have infact received little specific attention or evaluation. To remedy this gap, the author presents and justifies R-O(2), an explained variation measure for ordinal response models, which is based on a recent ordinal dispersion measure. The use and function of R-O(2) is illustrated, and the performance of it and other ordinal R-2 measures is compared via a series of simulated sampling and variable selection experiments. The R-O(2) and a bias-adjusted version of it perform well in the simulation experiments and have a number of other advantages that make them attractive as measures of fit for any ordinal response model.

AB One theme in the field research literature is that observer effects (or observer behavior) can act as a source of bias in observational data. This article uses both descriptive and quantitative data on reactivity from a large scale observational study of police to (1) describe and categorize instances of observer effects (in the form of observers helping officers), (2) specify hypothesized effects between rapport and observer effects, and (3) assess the impact of observer effects on patrol officer arrest and use of force behavior. Descriptive accounts indicate that observer behavior at times significantly altered the course of events. In addition, bivariate analyses suggest that observer effects are likely officer initiated rather than observer initiated. Finally, both bivariate and multivariate analyses revealed that observer effects are significant predictors of use of force but not arrest behavior net of a variety of controls for acclimation between officer and observer over the course of fieldwork, officer work orientation, suspect characteristics, and situational factors. The implications of these findings for future research are discussed.

AB The study of sex segregation is increasingly based on log-multiplicative and related models that allow analysts to characterize the amount and structure of segregation independently of (a) the mix of occupations in the economy and (b) the relative size of the male and female labor forces. Although these models are elegant and powerful, methodological complications can arise when the segregation arrays are sparse and small occupations frequently show up as perfectly segregated (i.e., all male or all female). The authors develop a general approach that makes it possible to analyze such sparse arrays with log-multiplicative and related models.

AB In a recent article (2005), the authors proposed the first-order approximation (FOA) index for the measurement of gender occupational segregation across detailed occupational categories. The FOA index can remedy the two inherent limitations-sensitivity and singulatity-associated with the ratio index and the association index, especially when applied to the measurement of micro-segregation. Grusky and Levanon (this issue), while acknowledging these limitations, view the FOA index as a misguided effort to remedy the shortcomings of the other indexes. When responding to Grusky and Levanon, the authors address two kinds of controversies. The first aims directly at the methodological reasoning put forward by Grusky and Levanon and centers on the statistical properties and statistical assumptions embodied in the various measures. The second revolves around different paradigmatic approaches to the study of occupational segregation and centers on different conceptual views of the gender segregation phenomenon.

AB As the counterfactual model of causality has increased in popularity, sociologists have returned to matching as a research methodology. In this article, advances over the past two decades in matching estimators are explained, and the practical limitations of matching techniques are emphasized. The authors introduce matching methods by focusing first on ideal scenarios in which stratification and weighting procedures warrant causal inference. Then, they discuss how matching is often undertaken in practice, offering an overview of the most prominent data analysis routines. With four hypothetical examples, they demonstrate how the assumptions behind matching estimators often break down in practice. Even so, the authors argue that matching techniques can be used effectively to strengthen the prosecution of causal questions in sociology.

AB In this article, the authors compare the traditional econometric fixed effect estimator with the maximum likelihood estimator implied by covariance structure models for panel data. Their findings are that the maximum likelihood estimator is remarkably robust to certain types of misspecifications (e.g., deviation from the assumption of an underlying normal distribution). However, with other types of misspecification, the fixed estimator is preferable. Furthermore, the authors suggest that the Hausman specification test may be used as a test of the consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator.

AB This article estimates the variation in personal network size, using respondent data containing two systematic sources of error. The data are the proportion of respondents who, on average, claim to know zero, one, and two people in various subpopulations, such as "people who are widows under the age of 65" or "people who are diabetics." The two kinds of error-transmission error (respondents are unaware that someone in their network is in a subpopulation) and barrier error (something causes a respondent to know more or less than would be expected, in a subpopulation)-are hard to quantify. The authors show how to estimate the shape of the probability density function (pdf) of the number of people known to a random individual by assuming that respondents give what they assume to be accurate responses based on incorrect knowledge. It is then possible to estimate the relative effective sizes of subpopulations and produce an internally consistent theory. These effective sizes permit an evaluation of the shape of the pdf, which, remarkably, agrees with earlier estimates.

AB The authors analyze data on marital satisfaction, obtained from couples at two distinct moments in time (1990, 1995). The data are of a bivariate longitudinal type. Moreover, some couples provide incomplete records only, usually because the 1995 follow-up interview has not taken place. The authors propose a hierarchical modeling strategy that takes all these features into account and is more generally valid than a classical complete case or single imputation-based strategy.

The model allows for multiple, potentially correlated factors at each level as well as covariate effects on the responses. Estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is described. The methodology is applied in an analysis of women's status in Bangladesh. Two dimensions of women's status are considered-social independence and decision-making power-and the factor structure of the responses at the woman and district levels is explored.

   KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES; SETTINGS
AB A number of algebraic approaches to dichotomous data have attracted interest in the social sciences. Despite their underlying connections, these different approaches have different assumptions and realms of applicability. In particular, some approaches (which may be termed explanatory) assume a certain a process that generates the data, while others (which may be termed interpretive) give a parsimonious representation of data patterns irrespective of a generative process. The former may also be termed one-sided in that they privilege one dimension of a conventional data matrix, while the latter are dual, in that they do not do this. In certain cases, one-sided analyses can be combined to produce "joint" analyses, which differ from dual analyses. A consideration of these differences casts light on the information retrieved by the various methods.

AB This study shows how correspondence analysis may be applied to a subset of response categories from a questionnaire survey (e.g., the subset of undecided responses or the subset of responses for a particular category across several questions). The idea is to maintain the original relative frequencies of the categories and not reexpress them relative to totals within the subset, as would normally be done in a regular correspondence analysis of the subset. Furthermore, the masses and chi-square distances assigned to the subset of categories are the same as those in the correspondence analysis of the whole data set, which leads to a decomposition of total variance into parts if the whole data set is subdivided into disjoint subsets. This variant of the method, called subset correspondence analysis, is illustrated on data from the International Social Survey Programme's Family and Changing Gender Roles survey.

AB Over the past 50 years, the expectation states research program has generated a set of interrelated theories to explain the relation between performance expectations and social influence. Yet while the relationship between performance expectations and social influence is now axiomatic, the reported effects do differ in magnitude, sometimes widely. The authors present results from the first formal meta-analysis of expectation states research on social influence. Their findings indicate that theoretically unimportant study-level differences alter expectation states and the baseline propensity to accept or reject social influence. Data from 26 separate experiments reveal that protocol variations, including the use of video and computer technology, sample size, and the number of trials, have important but previously unrecognized effects. The authors close by discussing the more general implications of their research for future investigators.

AB Two desirable properties of maximum likelihood-based parameter estimates are that the estimates are asymptotically unbiased and asymptotically normally distributed. In this article, the authors test whether the asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimation are achieved in sample sizes typically used in applications of group-based trajectory modeling. Through empirical results generated by resampling of population data, they find that the maximum likelihood estimates obtained in group-based trajectory models still provide reasonably close estimates of their true population values and have approximately normal distributions, even when estimated with a sample size as small as n = 500. Furthermore, and more important for the users of these types of models, the authors find similarly good performance in the model's ability to estimate the transformed quantities of main interest: the group trajectories and mixing probabilities.

AB The authors used the random response technique (RRT) to measure frequency of induced abortion in Mexico, where its practice is illegal under most circumstances. They applied RRT to a national, multistage probabilistic sample of 1,792 women ages 15 to 55. The distribution of women who reported having had an induced abortion was analyzed by sociodemographic characteristics. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with having had an induced abortion. Overall prevalence of induced abortion was 16.3 percent. Three factors were associated with reported induced abortion: having grown up in the city (bivariate odd ratio [OR] 2.16, multiple logistic OR 2.24), having never given birth (bivariate OR 1.60, multiple logistic OR 2.06), and having had an unwanted pregnancy (bivariate OR 2.09, multiple logistic OR 2.81). RRT produced a better estimation of induced abortion compared with other methodologies. This technique works best with urban and educated women.

AB The use of multilevel modeling with data from population-based surveys is often limited by the small number of cases per Level 2 unit, prompting a recent trend in the neighborhood literature to apply cluster techniques to address the problem of data sparseness. In this study, the authors use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the effects of marginal group sizes on multilevel model performance, bias, and efficiency. They then employ cluster analysis techniques to minimize data sparseness and examine the consequences in the simulations. They find that estimates of the fixed effects are robust at the extremes of data sparseness, while cluster analysis is an effective strategy to increase group size and prevent the overestimation of variance components. However, researchers should be cautious about the degree to which they use such clustering techniques due to the introduction of artificial within-group heterogeneity.

Based on the idea of data augmentation, they describe a generic Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm for estimation. They propose path sampling for computing the observed data likelihood functions that usually involve complicated integrals and show how to apply this method for computing the Bayesian information criterion for model comparison. An application of the proposed unified approach to a two-level nonlinear structural equation model with missing continuous and ordered categorical data is presented. An illustrative example with a real data set is given.

AB The factorial survey is an experimental design where respondents are asked to judge descriptions of varying situations (vignettes) presented to them. Combining the vignette variables (factors) and their levels is done by the researcher, who also takes the responsibility for getting an optimal design. To represent the universe of possible level combinations as accurately as possible, random designs are mostly used. A possible alternative are quoted designs. Up to now, there has been little discussion and only few research studies done about the pros and cons of random and quota samples for factorial surveys. The purpose of this article is to contribute to filling this gap. The conclusions drawn from the statistical considerations are illustrated by example analyses on the basis of fictitious data. Since the data structure produced by a factorial survey is a hierarchical one, the empirical analyses are carried out by using a multilevel program.

AB Leverage-saliency theory provides a seminal basis for research on the differential effects of response-facilitating techniques in surveys. In this article, a quasi-experimental design is applied to analyze the effect of follow-up procedures, taking into account the sample persons' interest in the survey topic. The authors use multilevel logistic regression to map response on a mail questionnaire in the second step of a two-step data collection procedure. It is found that-after controlling for the effects of sociodemographic and performance-related covariates-the effect of follow-up procedures is larger for those less interested in the survey topic. As such, these findings are an empirical confirmation of the leverage-saliency theory. Some implications for survey research are discussed.

AB The odds ratio is one of the most widely used measures of association for 2 x 2 tables. A generalized Yule coefficient transforms the odds ratio into a correlation-like scale with a range from -1 to 1. Yule's Y, Yule's Q, Digby's H, and a new coefficient are special cases of a generalized Yule coefficient. The new coefficient is shown to be similar in value to the phi coefficient. A confidence interval and sample size formula for a generalized Yule coefficient are proposed. The proposed confidence interval is shown to perform much better than the Wald intervals that are implemented in statistical packages.

ID NATIONAL POLICY
AB The authors consider how to construct summary indices (e.g., quality-of-life [QOL] indices) for a social unit that will be endorsed by a majority of its citizens. They assume that many social indicators are available to describe the social unit, but individuals disagree about the relative weights to be assigned to each social indicator. The summary index that maximizes agreement among citizens can then be derived, along with conditions under which an index will be endorsed by a majority in the social unit. The authors show that intuition greatly underestimates the extent of agreement among individuals, and it is often possible to construct a QOL index that most citizens agree with (at least in direction). In particular, they show that the equal-weighting strategy is privileged in that it minimizes disagreement among all possible individuals' weights. They demonstrate these propositions by calculating real QOL indices for two surveys of citizens' actual importance weights.

ID MISSING DATA; GROWTH; PATTERNS; HEALTH; WOMEN
AB Surveys often sample adults across a broad range of ages, measuring the same outcomes in several interviews spaced during a period of years and comparing the changes observed across segments of the adult life course. Put in sequence, those change vectors provide a composite image of the outcome's life course trajectory. To illustrate, the authors estimate depression vectors in a sample of U.S. adults ages 18 and older at baseline in 1995, with follow-up interviews in 1998 and 2001. They show the vector equations and their graphs and also their synthetic-cohort projection. The authors introduce the trend-function and virtual-cohort projection, showing how they provide tests of "convergence" and other hypotheses about trajectories and trends. Results show depression dropping and then rising across adulthood more steeply than suggested by cross-sectional differences among age groups. They also indicate a rise and fall in age-specific levels of depression across cohorts.

Group-based trajectory is a specialized application of finite mixture modeling and is designed to identify clusters of individuals following similar progressions of some behavior or outcome over age or time. This article has two purposes. One is to summarize extensions of the methodology and of the SAS procedure that have been developed since Jones et al. The other is to illustrate how group-based trajectory modeling lends itself to presentation of findings in the form of easily understood graphical and tabular data summaries.

ID SAMPLE SELECTION BIAS; LIMITED DEPENDENT-VARIABLES; MODELS
AB McDonald and Moffitt's (1980) decomposition method for Tobit coefficients disaggregates the total changes in a censored outcome variable into the changes in the probability of attaining noncensored values and the changes in the noncensored values themselves. McDonald and Moffitt, however, did not highlight two limitations of this decomposition, and sociological applications of the Tobit decomposition that do not acknowledge these limitations have been misleading. First, the decomposition ratio of the two effects depends on the choice of an observation point in the sample. Some sociological studies invalidly generalized a decomposition at the mean point of the sample to the whole sample. Second, once the observation point is fixed, the decomposition ratio is the same across all coefficients or across all predictors. That is, the two effects remain proportionally constant, but studies often erroneously assume they differ across predictors. Further implications are discussed in relation to other selection bias models.

AB The multinomial logit model is perhaps the most commonly used regression model for nominal outcomes in the social sciences. A concern raised by many researchers, however, is the assumption of the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) that is implicit in the model. In this article, the authors undertake a series of Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the three most commonly discussed tests of IIA. Results suggest that the size properties of the most common IIA tests depend on the data structure for the independent variables. These findings are consistent with an earlier impression that, even in well-specified models, IIA tests often reject the assumption when the alternatives seem distinct and often fail to reject IIA when the alternatives can reasonably be viewed as close substitutes. The authors conclude that tests of the IIA assumption that are based on the estimation of a restricted choice set are unsatisfactory for applied work.

ID INFERENCE
AB Most existing models of ecological inference are based on the assumption that there is no aggregation bias. Few studies have focused on how to correct/ model aggregation bias. This article takes advantage of a unique opportunity to compare the controversial ecological inference methods by using aggregate as well as individual-level data from an actual election. Furthermore, the true quantities of interest are also available, which guarantees the accuracy of the empirical tests. Our mean squared error analyses show that King's Ecological Inference (EI) basic model does not always outperform the traditional ecological regression and neighborhood methods when aggregation bias does exist. However, using an appropriate covariate in the King's El extended model to correct the aggregation bias problem can drastically improve the estimation accuracy at both the precinct and district levels. This article also makes suggestions on how to use a covariate in a King's extended model.

AB This article compares maximum likelihood (ML) estimation to three variants of two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation in structural equation models. The authors use models that are both correctly and incorrectly specified. Simulated data are used to assess bias, efficiency, and accuracy of hypothesis tests. Generally, 2SLS with reduced sets of instrumental variables performs similarly to ML when models are correctly specified. Under correct specification, both estimators have little bias except at the smallest sample sizes and are approximately equally efficient. As predicted, when models are incorrectly specified, 2SLS generally performs better, with less bias and more accurate hypothesis tests. Unless a researcher has tremendous confidence in the correctness of his or her model, these results suggest that a 2SLS estimator should be considered.

ID DIETARY DATA
AB The authors illustrate how to perform maximum-likelihood estimation in latent class (LC) analysis when there are sampling weights. The methods are natural extensions of the approaches proposed by Clogg and Eliason (1987) and Magidson (1987) for dealing with sampling weights in the log-linear analysis of frequency tables. For the log-linear form of the LC model, the approach corresponds to a special case of Haberman's (1979) log-linear LC model with cell weights. This approach can also be applied to the probability formulation of the LC model with cell weights, which can accommodate many indicators. The authors propose an efficient estimation-maximization algorithm for estimating the parameters for this formulation. A small simulation study shows that the probability estimates obtained by this approach compare favorably to other weighting approaches. Several empirical examples are provided to illustrate various possible weighting methods in LC analysis.

AB Longitudinal studies provide useful and unique data for social science research but are labor intensive and expensive. Key to conducting a successful longitudinal study is the ability to locate respondents in the follow-up effort. We conducted a 35-year longitudinal study among Mexican Americans in Los Angeles, California, and San Antonio, Texas. In this article, the authors describe (a) the individualized approach used in searching and (b) how recent technological developments have provided extensive sources of information that facilitated the searching process. The authors locate 79 percent of their sample. This study differs from previous longitudinal studies in that (a) the population is ethnic, urban, and working class; (b) more than 30 years had passed since the original study; (c) the authors built on a study not originally designed as a longitudinal effort; and (d) there had been no contact with respondents in the intervening period.

AB The credibility of quantitative social science benefits from policies that increase confidence that results reported by one researcher can be verified by others. Concerns about replicability have increased as the scale and sophistication of analyses increase the possible dependence of results on subtle analytic decisions and decrease the extent to which published articles contain full descriptions of methods. The author argues that sociology should adopt standards regarding replication that minimize its conceptualization as an ethical and individualistic matter and advocates for a policy in which authors use independent online archives to deposit the maximum possible information for replicating published results at the time of publication and are explicit about the conditions of availability for any necessary materials that are not provided. The author responds to several objections that might be raised to increasing the transparency of quantitative sociology in this way and offers a candidate replication policy for sociology.

AB Jeremy Freese makes the case for data sharing as a condition of publication for quantitative research in sociology, and Gary King tells us of a Dataverse Network under construction that is designed to routinize the process of posting and storing such data sets. No matter how user-friendly that network turns out to be, it is clear that no system is entirely cost-free, either for researchers or for journal editors. It is important, then, to determine whether the benefits of mandatory data sharing (or "data relinquishment," as Herrnson calls it) would outweigh the costs. In this comment, the author discusses the issue from his vantage point as a former editor and concludes that the benefits of such a requirement most likely would exceed the costs.

AB Commentators appreciate the benefits of developing improved standards for replicating quantitative results in sociology. Nonetheless, reservations remain, and the author addresses several of them and explains why improved replication standards do not endanger participant confidentiality, do not undermine incentives for collecting data, do not need to wait for greater standardization of data formats, need not require that editors assign a reviewer to actually replicate results, and do not diminish methodological diversity in any positive sense. The author concludes by encouraging sociologists to find a way of moving beyond intermittent discussions of replication standards to collective action.

AB Least absolute deviation (LAD) is a well-known criterion to fit statistical models, but little-is known about LAD estimation in structural equation modeling (SEM). To address this gap, the authors use the LAD criterion in SEM by minimizing the sum of the absolute deviations between the observed and the model-implied covariance matrices. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the authors compare the performance of this LAD estimator along several dimensions (bias, efficiency, convergence, frequencies of improper solutions, and absolute percentage deviation) to the full information maximum likelihood (ML) and unweighted least squares (ULS) estimators in structural equation modeling. The results for LAD are mixed: There are special conditions under which the LAD estimator outperforms ML and ULS, but the simulation evidence does not support a general claim that LAD is superior to ML and ULS in small samples.

SO SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH

DT Article
ID VALIDATION; QUESTIONS
AB Randomized response (RR) is an interview technique designed to eliminate response bias when sensitive questions are asked. In RR the answer depends partly on the true status of the respondent and partly on the outcome of a randomizing device. Although RR elicits more honest answers than direct questions do, it is susceptible to self-protective response behavior; that is, the respondent gives an evasive answer irrespective of the outcome of the randomizing device. The authors present a log-linear RR model that accounts for this kind of self-protection (SP). The main results of this SP model are estimates of (1) the probability of SP, (2) the log-linear parameters describing the associations between the sensitive characteristics, and (3) the prevalence of the sensitive characteristics that are corrected for SP. The model is illustrated with two examples from a Dutch survey measuring noncompliance with social welfare rules.

ID CANCER RATES
AB Social indicators and demographic rates are often arrayed over time by age. The patterns of rates by age at one point in time may not reflect the effects associated with aging, which are more properly studied in cohorts. Cohort succession, aging, and period-specific historical events provide accounts of social and demographic change. Because cohort membership can be defined by age at a particular period, the statistical partitioning of age from period and cohort effects focuses attention on identifying restrictions. When applying statistical models to social data, identification issues are ubiquitous, so some of the debates that vexed the formative literature on age-period-cohort models can now be understood in a larger context. Four new articles on age-period-cohort modeling call attention to the multilevel nature of the problem and draw on advances in methods including nonparametric smoothing, fixed and random effects, and identification in structural or causal models.

AB Yang and Land (2006) and Yang (forthcoming-b) developed a mixed (fixed and random) effects model for the age-period-cohort (APC) analysis of micro data sets in the form of a series of repeated cross-section sample surveys that are increasingly available to demographers. The authors compare the fixed-versus random-effects model specifications for APC analysis. They use data on verbal test scores from 15 cross sections of the General Social Survey (GSS), 1974 to 2000, for substantive illustrations. Strengths and weaknesses are identified for both the random- and fixed-effects formulations. However, under each of the two data conditions studied, the random-effects hierarchical APC model is the most appropriate specification. While additional analyses and comparisons of random- and fixed-effects APC models using other data sets are necessary before generalizations can be drawn, this finding is consistent with results from other methodological studies with unbalanced data designs.

ID BREAST-CANCER; ESTIMATOR; SPLINES; TRENDS
AB This article considers the effects of age, period, and cohort in social studies and chronic disease epidemiology through age-period-cohort (APC) analysis. These factors are linearly dependent; thus, the multiple classification model, a regression model that takes these factors as covariates in APC analysis, suffers from an identifiability problem with multiple estimators. A data set of homicide arrest rates is used to illustrate the problem. A smoothing cohort model is proposed that allows flexible structure of the effects for age, period, and cohort and avoids the identifiability problem. Results are provided for the consistency of estimation of model intercept and age effects as the number of periods goes to infinity under a mild bounded cohort condition. This also leads to consistent estimation for period and cohort effects. Analyses of homicide arrest rate and lung cancer mortality rate data demonstrate that the smoothing cohort model yields unique parameter estimation with sensible trend interpretation.

The goal is to specify the mechanisms through which the age, period, and cohort variables affect the outcome and in doing so identify the model. This approach allows for a broader set of identification strategies than has typically been considered in the literature and, in many circumstances, goodness of fit tests are possible. The authors illustrate the utility of the approach by developing an APC model for political alienation.

AB For more than 30 years, sociologists and demographers have struggled to come to terms with the age, period, cohort conundrum: Given the linear dependency between age groups, periods, and cohorts, how can these effects be estimated separately? This article offers a partial solution to this problem. The authors treat cohort effects as random effects and age and period effects as fixed effects in a mixed model. Using this approach, they can (1) assess the amount of variance in the dependent variable that is associated with cohorts while controlling for the age and period dummy variables, (2) model the dependencies that result from the age-period-specific rates for a single cohort being observed multiple times, and (3) assess how much of the variance in observations that is associated with cohorts is explained by differences in the characteristics of cohorts. The authors use empirical data to see how their results compare with other analyses in the literature.

AB Caren and Panofsky (2005) seek to advance qualitative comparative analysis QCA) by demonstrating that it can be used to study causal conditions that occur in sequences and introduce a technique they call TQCA (temporal QCA). In their formulation, the causal conjuncture is a sequence of conditions or events. The authors applaud their effort and agree that it is important to address this aspect of causation. This comment clarifies and corrects aspects of their analysis and present methods for assessing temporality that are more amenable to truth table analysis and the use of existing software, fsQCA. The methods presented utilize codings that indicate event order in addition to codings that indicate whether specific events occurred. They also demonstrate how to use "don't care" codings to bypass consideration of event sequences when they are not relevant (e.g., as when only a single event occurs).

AB In the analysis of cross-classified data, the quantities of interest are frequently odds ratios. Although odds ratios are functions of the interaction parameters in association models, the usual way of normalizing and identifying these parameters means that their relationship with the odds ratios of interest is indirect. This can lead to interpretative confusions. The author points to the benefits of defining the interaction parameters of a model to have a one-to-one relationship with the odds ratios of interest, thus overcoming problems of interpretation. Three examples are presented to illustrate the argument.

AB This article is an empirical evaluation of the choice of fixed cutoff points in assessing the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) test statistic as a measure of goodness-of-fit in Structural Equation Models. Using simulation data, the authors first examine whether there is any empirical evidence for the use of a universal cutoff, and then compare the practice of using the point estimate of the RMSEA alone versus that of using it jointly with its related confidence interval. The results of the study demonstrate that there is little empirical support for the use of .05 or any other value as universal cutoff values to determine adequate model fit, regardless of whether the point estimate is used alone or jointly with the confidence interval. The authors' analyses suggest that to achieve a certain level of power or Type I error rate, the choice of cutoff values depends on model specifications, degrees of freedom, and sample size.

AB The randomized response technique (RRT) attempts to reduce social desirability bias in self-reports by creating a probabilistic relationship between the response given and the question posed. The multi-item RRT extends the RRT procedure to scales composed of multiple items. The multi-item RRT reduces the added variability contributed by the procedure and affords more accurate estimates of parameters than does a single-item RRT. Formulas are presented for correcting the mean, standard deviation, and correlation coefficient for the procedure. Data are presented from a study (Jarman 1996) of male date rape to illustrate the application of the multi-item RRT. Those data show higher reports of rape-supportive attitudes, beliefs, and sexual aggression under RRT conditions.

AB Data editing, a crucial task in the data production process, has received little scientific attention. Consequently, there is no consensus among social scientists about how data should be edited or by whom. While some argue that it should be left to data managers and data users, others claim that it is primarily a task for fieldworkers. The authors review these divergent approaches to editing and evaluate the underlying theoretical arguments. Results are reported from a methodological experiment in which different types of actors who are party to the data production and research process were asked to solve artificially generated inconsistencies in real survey data. Results are informative on two counts. First, the least accurate editors were the researchers with no field experience in the survey sites. Second, when provided with only partial information on which to make editing decisions, fieldworkers edited more accurately than both data managers and data users.

A structural equation modeling approach is applied to measure the stability of one acquiescence factor behind two concepts among the same respondents for a 4-year period. The data used are representative population surveys in 1995 and 1999 from the Belgian Election Study in which balanced sets of items are used for measuring two inter-related constructs: perceived ethnic threat and distrust in politics. This study provides empirical support that acquiescence is stable and consistent for a 4-year period.

AB Despite great attention to the quality of research methods in individual studies, if publication decisions of journals are a function of the statistical significance of research findings, the published literature as a whole may not produce accurate measures of true effects. This article examines the two most prominent sociology journals (the American Sociological Review and the American Journal of Sociology) and another important though less influential journal (The Sociological Quarterly) for evidence of publication bias. The effect of the .05 significance level on the pattern of published findings is examined using a "caliper'' test, and the hypothesis of no publication bias can be rejected at approximately the 1 in 10 million level. Findings suggest that some of the results reported in leading sociology journals may be misleading and inaccurate due to publication bias. Some reasons for publication bias and proposed reforms to reduce its impact on research are also discussed.

AB This article analyzes the mathematical connections between two kinds of inequality: inequality between persons (e. g., income inequality) and inequality between subgroups (e. g., racial inequality). The authors define a general inequality parameter in two-parameter continuous distributions. This parameter governs all measures of personal inequality (e. g., the Gini coefficient) and governs as well the gap (difference or ratio) between the means of subdistributions. It is thus established that in the distributions analyzed here, as personal inequality increases, so does inequality between subgroups. This general inequality parameter also governs Lorenz dominance and all quantities in the decomposition of Theil's mean logarithmic deviation into between-subgroup and within- subgroup components in the Pareto case. Thus, the general inequality parameter captures the "deep structure'' of inequality. Finally, a whole-distribution graphical tool is introduced for assessing personal and subgroup inequality. Substantively, this work suggests that in societies characterized by special income distributions, whenever inequality disrupts social cohesion, it attacks on two fronts, via subgroup inequality as well as personal inequality.

AB Social scientists often rely on survey data to examine group differences. A problem with survey data is the potential misclassification of group membership due to poorly trained interviewers, inconsistent responses, or errors in marking questions. In data containing unequal subsample sizes, the consequences of misclassification can be considerable, especially for groups with small sample sizes. In this study, the authors develop a new mixture model that allows researchers to address the problem using the data they have. By supplying additional information from the data, this two-stage model is estimated using a Bayesian method. The method is illustrated with the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study data. As anticipated, the more information supplied to adjust for group membership, the better the model performs. Even when small amounts of information are supplied, the model produces reasonably robust estimates and improves the fit compared to the no-adjustment model. Sensitivity analyses are conducted on choices of priors.

AB This study tests the feasibility, effectiveness, and efficiency of respondent-driven sampling (RDS) as a Web-based sampling method. Web-based RDS (WebRDS) is found to be highly efficient and effective. The online nature of WebRDS allows referral chains to progress very quickly, such that studies with large samples can be expected to proceed up to 20 times faster than with traditional sampling methods. Additionally, the unhidden nature of the study population allows comparison of RDS estimators to institutional data. Results indicate that RDS estimates are reasonable but not precise. This is likely due to bias associated with the random recruitment assumption and small sample size of the study. Finally, this article presents methods for testing the validity of assumptions required by RDS estimation.

AB The author proposes a three-dimensional latent variable (trait) model for analyzing attitudinal scaled data. It is successfully applied to two examples: one with 12 binary items and the other with 8 items of five categories each. The models are exploratory instead of confirmatory, and subscales from which data were selected are clearly identified. For binary items, it gives similar results with factor analysis. For polytomous items, it can estimate category scores simultaneously with the internal structure. From that, another dimension of the degree to take moderate views is extracted. This is because conventional analyses usually fix category scores as numbers, while they are free to vary in latent variable models. Computational problems are discussed, and it is expected that more than three dimensions are possible given today's computing power and tailor-made methods such as adaptive quadrature points for numerical integrations.

AB Given recent genetic advances, it is not surprising that genetics information is increasingly being used to improve health care. Thousands of conditions caused by single genes (Mendelian diseases) have been identified over the last century. However, Mendelian diseases are rare; thus, few individuals directly benefit from gene identification. In contrast, common complex diseases, such as obesity, breast cancer, and depression, directly affect many more individuals. Common complex diseases are caused by multiple genes, environmental factors, and/or interaction of genetic and environmental factors. This article provides a framework for the successful conduct of gene-environment studies. To accomplish this goal, the basic study designs and procedures of implementation for gene-environment interaction are described. Next, examples of gene-environment interaction in obesity epidemiology are reviewed. Last, the authors review reasons why epidemiological studies that incorporate gene-environment interaction have been unable to demonstrate statistically significant interactions and why conflicting results are reported.

AB The objective of this article is to provide a nontechnical and intuitive introduction to the basic concepts and techniques that are used to establish statistical connections between genetic variants and human phenotypes. Depressive symptoms and delinquent behaviors that are of interest to sociologists are a subset of such human phenotypes. This article focuses on basic linkage analysis and association studies, the essential ideas behind the methods, and a very limited amount of molecular genetics needed for understanding the ideas. The article is written with those social scientists in mind who are interested in the topic but not yet ready to engage the vast and rapidly developing primary literature (journal articles).

AB Sociologists are increasingly involved with the design and execution of studies that examine the interplay between genes and environment, requiring expertise in measurement of both genetic and nongenetic factors. In addition, there are important lessons from a literature, heretofore directed primarily at medical geneticists and clinical researchers, that examines the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of the genomic revolution. This article introduces ELSI perspectives on the challenges that confront investigators who undertake gene-environment research and offers nine recommendations based on this literature. These challenges include assessing how genetic information is understood; minimizing potential risks of harm from participation in gene-environment research; and considering ethical aspects of variable selection, study design, dissemination of study findings, and whether to disclose genetic results to individual participants.

AB Web surveys are a popular survey mode, but the subpopulation with Internet access may not represent the population of interest. The authors investigate whether adjusting using weights or matching on a small set of variables makes the distributions of target variables representative of the population. This application has a rich sampling design; the Internet sample is part of an existing probability sample, the Health and Retirement Study, that is representative of the U. S. population aged 50 and older. For the dichotomous variables investigated, the adjustment helps. On average, the sample means in the Internet access sample differ by 6.5 percent before and 3.7 percent after adjustment. Still, a large number of adjusted estimates remain significantly different from their target estimates based on the complete sample. This casts doubt on the common procedure to use only a few variables to correct for the selectivity of convenience samples.

ID SUBCLASSIFICATION; BIAS
AB A combination of propensity score and calibration adjustment is shown to reduce bias in volunteer panel Web surveys. In this combination, the design weights are adjusted by propensity scores to correct for selection bias due to nonrandomized sampling. These adjusted weights are then calibrated to control totals for the target population and correct for coverage bias. The final set of weights is comprised of multiple components, and the estimator of a total no longer takes a linear form. Therefore, approximate methods are needed to derive variance estimates. This study compares three variance estimation methods through simulation. The first method resembles what is used in commercial statistical software based on squared residuals. The second approach uses a variance estimator originally derived for the generalized regression estimator. The third method uses jackknife replication. Results indicate bias reduction is crucial for valid variance estimation and favor the replication method over the other approaches.

AB Using data from Survey2001, we analyze how visual images embedded in a web-based survey can ( 1) reduce nonresponse in the specific case that a respondent prematurely terminates the survey and ( 2) preserve measurement validity. Page-by-page progression through the survey is modeled as a survival process with early termination seen as failure. While images had no apparent effect on the termination process, respondent interest in the survey topic was linked to early termination. These results highlight the importance of placing interest-related questions early in the survey to better control for the effects of interest-driven attrition. Moreover, these findings suggest that an interactional information system approach, one that not only collects data but also pushes relevant information to respondents, may serve to generate or maintain interest and in the process reduce survey attrition.

AB In this article, an information-processing perspective is used to explore the impact of response categories on the answers respondents provide in Web surveys. Response categories have a significant effect on response formulation in questions that are difficult to process, whereas in easier questions ( where responses are based on direct recall) the response scales have a smaller effect. In general, people with less cognitive sophistication are more affected by contextual cues. The Need for Cognition and the Need to Evaluate indexes for motivation account for a significant part of the variance in survey responding. Interactions of ability to process information and motivation combine in regulating responses for questions that are more difficult to process. The results hint at a substantial role of satisficing in Web surveys.

AB This paper explores how the visual design of scalar questions influences responses in web surveys. We present the results of five experiments embedded in two web surveys of university students. We find that consistently presenting the positive end of the scale first did not impact responses but increases response times. Displaying the categories in multiple columns influence how respondents process the scale and increase response times. Separating the midpoint, "don't know'' option, or endpoints spatially does not impact responses when the visual and conceptual midpoint align. Removing the graphical layout of the scale influences responses when lower numbers indicate more positive categories and increases response time. Finally, response times are longer for polar point scales with numeric labels, but there are no differences in responses. Overall, our results suggest that the visual design of response scales impacts measurement, but that some manipulations produce larger and more significant differences than others.

DE Smartphones; data collection methods; behavioral patterns; validity;

AB Recent developments in mobile technologies have produced a new kind of device: a programmable mobile phone, the smartphone. In this article, the authors argue that the technological and social characteristics of this device make it a useful tool in social sciences, particularly sociology, social psychology, urban studies, technology assessment, and media studies. The device is willingly carried by a large fraction of people in developed countries, integrates a number of technologies for automatic observation, can be programmed to interact with the user, and can communicate with remote researchers. This allows unobtrusive and cost-effective access to previously inaccessible sources of data on everyday social behavior, such as physical proximity of people, phone calls, and patterns of movement. The authors describe three studies in human behavior that have augmented existing methods with the smartphone, two of which the authors conducted themselves. Based on their experience, the authors critically evaluate the improvements and threats to validity and reliability of smartphone-augmented methods. These approaches are rapidly becoming feasible for the social scientist, since research software for smartphones have been published in open source, which lowers the technical and economic investment needed for their utilization in research.

AB The robustness of outcomes to the parameterization of behavioral rules is a crucial property of any model aimed at simulating complex human systems. Schelling model of residential segregation satisfies this criterion. Based on the recently available high-resolution census GIS, we apply Schelling model for investigating urban population patterns at the resolution of individual buildings and families. First, we simulate ethnic residential dynamics in Yaffo (an area of Tel Aviv), and demonstrate good quantitative correspondence for a 40-year period. Second, we investigate income-based residential patterns in nine Israeli cities, reveal their high heterogeneity, and explain the latter by the presence of low fraction of wealthier householders who are tolerant of their poorer neighbors and reside in their proximity. We extend Schelling model in this direction and demonstrate qualitative correspondence between the model's outcomes and the observed income-based residential patterns.

AB The nature of urban neighborhoods, neighborhood effects, and the dynamics of residential segregation are important themes in contemporary sociological inquiry. Agent-based models of social systems have been widely applied in this context. However, both applied and model-based research in these areas suffer from weaknesses in underlying conceptualizations and representations of spatial context. Drawing on human geography and the sociospatial perspective in urban sociology, a framework that enables richer and more realistic representation of urban neighborhoods in agent-based simulation models is proposed and outlined. The framework relies on a graph representation of the spatial relations among spatial locations and can accommodate well-defined administrative zones, vague or ill-defined neighborhoods, hierarchically nested spatial zoning systems, overlapping neighborhoods, and changing relations among neighborhoods. Results from a preliminary application of the framework demonstrate its utility and possibilities for research into the effects of neighborhood structure on social processes.

DE heterogeneous choice models; location-scale models; ordinal regression;
   logit; probit
AB Allison (1999) notes that comparisons of logit and probit coefficients across groups can be invalid and misleading, proposes a procedure by which these problems can be corrected, and argues that "routine use [of this method] seems advisable'' and that "it is hard to see how [the method] can be improved.'' In this article, the author argues that as originally proposed, Allison's method can have serious problems and should not be applied on a routine basis. However, this study also shows that his model belongs to a larger class of models variously known as heterogeneous choice or location-scale models. Several advantages of this broader and more flexible class of models are illustrated. Dependent variables can be ordinal in addition to binary, sources of heterogeneity can be better modeled and controlled for, and insights can be gained into the effects of group characteristics on outcomes that would be missed by other methods.

AB This article provides the first systematic empirical examination of four major genres of theories concerning the nature and rise of the corpus of human emotions with more than 2,000 statistical tests of five hypotheses. The distinction between evolutionary-universal and other "secondary'' emotions is empirically uninformative for all five cultures. Next, the emotion-wheel theory of Plutchik receives no empirical support. All palette theories fail four empirical tests. More than 90 empirical tests fail to support Kemper and Turner in assuming that many secondary emotions arise through complex combinations of primary emotions due to socialization. The Johnson-Laird and Oatley hypothesis of five universal clusters of emotions is also tested and rejected. Researchers need to rethink the heuristic value of dichotomizing and lumping emotions in categories such as universal, primary, basic, secondary, tertiary, and so forth. There are clear empirical advantages to differentiating between emotions with three dimensions rather than two dimensions.

AB The authors reply to Zax's critique of the double-equation method for ecological regression and of the specific extension to it proposed by Grofman and Migalski. Although Zax does correct two minor errors in Grofman and Migalski's statement of the double-equation approach, neither of those errors affected the final calculations reported in their article. Furthermore, nothing Zax reports affects their fundamental conclusion that double-equation methods can be superior to single-equation techniques if there is substantial error in the measurement of the independent variable. In particular, by analyzing an election for which, from exit polls, the "true'' parameters of Hispanic and non-Hispanic levels of political cohesion are known, the authors show that double-equation ecological regression estimates derived from registration data are highly accurate in reproducing the true individual-level behavioral parameters (group means).

AB Recent evidence makes clear that states public high school graduation rates are well measured using information from the Common Core of Data (CCD). This article investigates the substantive consequences for the results of empirical analyses of using different CCD-based measures of states' public high school graduation rates. The authors show that substantive conclusions about the levels, correlates, and predictors of states' public high school graduation rates are dependent on how those rates are measured using the CCD data. Warren's (2005) estimated completion rate is the most conceptually and technically sound CCD-based measure, and that measure is improved in this study. The public high school graduation rate for the class of 2004 was about 76 percent, although that rate varied considerably by race/ethnicity and across states.

AB In The Comparative Method, Ragin (1987) outlined a procedure of Boolean causal reasoning operating on pure coincidence data that has since become widely known as qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) among social scientists. QCA-including its recent forms as presented in Ragin (2000, 2008)-is designed to analyze causal structures featuring no more than one effect and a possibly complex configuration of mutually independent direct causes of that effect. This article presents a procedure of causal reasoning that operates on the same type of empirical data as QCA and that implements Boolean techniques related to the ones resorted to by QCA. Yet in contrast to QCA, the procedure introduced here successfully identifies structures involving both multiple effects and mutually dependent causes. In this sense, this article generalizes QCA.

AB In this article the authors develop goodness-of-fit tests for fuzzy-set analyses to formally assess the fit between empirical information and various causal hypotheses while accounting for measurement error in membership scores. These goodness-of-fit tests, and the accompanying logic, provide a sound inferential foundation for fuzzy-set methodology. The authors also develop descriptive measures to complement these tests. Examples from Stryker and Eliason (2003) and Mahoney (2003) show how goodness-of-fit tests and descriptive measures may be used to assess individual causal factors as well as conjunctions of factors. The authors show how these tools provide more information in a fuzzy-set analysis than do tests currently in use. In providing this inferential foundation, the authors also show that fuzzy-set methods (a) are no less amenable to falsificationist methods of the Neyman-Pearson type than are standard statistical techniques and (b) may be usefully applied in either an exploratory/inductive or a confirmatory/deductive research design.

AB In recent years, there have been efforts to develop latent class models for trajectories. The semiparametric mixed Poisson regression (SMPR) model has been used in many empirical studies, but there have been few attempts to evaluate the robustness of the estimates from this model. The authors use simulated data to evaluate the performance of the SMPR model under a variety of assumptions. They find that estimates are sensitive to the conditional distribution of counts and misspecification of the shape of the trajectory. When there is only one underlying trajectory and overdispersion is present, the SMPR model frequently finds multiple groups, which often appear to differ in shape as well as level. The tendency can be substantially reduced by use of the zero-inflated Poisson distribution in conjunction with top-coding of large counts. The article concludes with a discussion of other extensions and alternatives to the standard SMPR model that might provide more robust estimates.

The pilot study was fielded in the fall of 2006, approximately 1 year after Hurricane Katrina. This article describes the motivation for the pilot study, outlines its design, and describes the fieldwork results using a set of fieldwork outcome rates and multivariate logistic models. It ends with a discussion of the lessons learned from the pilot study for future studies of the effects of Hurricane Katrina on the population of New Orleans. The results point to the challenges and opportunities of studying this unique population.

AB One major methodological problem in analysis of sequence data is the determination of costs from which distances between sequences are derived. Although this problem is currently not optimally dealt with in the social sciences, it has some similarity with problems that have been solved in bioinformatics for three decades. In this article, the authors propose an optimization of substitution and deletion/insertion costs based on computational methods. The authors provide an empirical way of determining costs for cases, frequent in the social sciences, in which theory does not clearly promote one cost scheme over another. Using three distinct data sets, the authors tested the distances and cluster solutions produced by the new cost scheme in comparison with solutions based on cost schemes associated with other research strategies. The proposed method performs well compared with other cost-setting strategies, while it alleviates the justification problem of cost schemes.

AB Optimal matching (OM) is a method for measuring the similarity between pairs of sequences (e.g., work histories). This article discusses two problems with optimal matching. First, the author identifies a flaw in OM "indel costs'' and proposes a solution to this flaw. Second, the author discusses the need for benchmarks to measure the added value of OM and to test competing versions. To that end, the author conducts an empirical test of traditional OM, the alternative localized OM, and sequence comparison. The test documents the problem with traditional OM and shows that it is solved by localized OM. The test also demonstrates the value of OM and sequence comparison in examining occupational sequences; both methods capture variation beyond traditional human capital and status attainment measures, although the marginal improvements of OM over sequence comparison may not justify its computational complexity. These results point to the need for more systematic approaches to sequence analysis methods.

AB Goodman and Kruskal's gamma coefficient measuring monotone association and its partial variants are useful for the analysis of multiway contingency tables containing ordinal variables. When the categories of a variable are only partly ordered and the variable is treated as a nominal variable, information in the ordering of the categories and statistical power is lost. The authors suggest a (P)gamma measure that is the maximum of the ordinary gamma coefficients obtained by permuting the categories of nominal or partially ordered variables, while leaving the partial ordering intact. When the assumption of a monotone underlying association is justified, this measure has higher power than nominal tests for association. Furthermore, the resulting optimal monotone ordering gives insight into the nature of this association, which is not obtained by tests for nominal variables. The properties of the (P)gamma coefficient are investigated in a simulation study and its use illustrated in two data sets.

AB The scale-up estimator is a network-based estimator for the size of hidden or hard to count subpopulations. Several issues arise in the public health context when the aim is the estimation of injuries occurring in a certain population, where two common problems are present: (a) Small injuries are usually difficult to observe and rarely reported in the official data and (b) people are not always compliant in giving information about some specific injuries, in particular when children are involved. This study checked the methodological issues arising from using a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) survey using the scale-up methodology for detecting the number of injuries due to choking in children ages 0 to 14 in Italy. For this purpose, 1,000 CATI interviews were conducted during a week using a questionnaire based on 33 questions about populations of known size according to census data. Then, each respondent was asked about other questions related to the main target population (e.g., number of children known to suffer from a choking accident). A sensitivity analysis was conducted for estimating the effect of varying subpopulations, order of the questions, and interviewer effects on the resulting estimates. For the interviewer effect, no particular differences were observed in the overall estimates of injuries. The conclusion is the scale-up estimator in association with CATI methodology shows a high potential in the field of injury prevention, being accurate and robust, but particular attention should be given to the training of the interviewers to improve stability of the estimates.

AB Ordinal-level measures are very common in social science research. Researchers often analyze ordinal dependent variables using the proportional odds logistic regression model. However, this "traditional'' method is one of many different types of logistic regression models available for the analysis of ordered response variables. In this article, the author identifies 12 distinct models that rely on logistic regression and fit within a framework of three major approaches with variations within each approach based on the application of the proportional odds assumption. This typology provides a degree of conceptual clarity that is missing in the extant literature on logistic regression models for ordinal outcomes. The author illustrates the similarities and differences among the different models with examples from the General Social Survey and the American National Election Study.

AB The optimal matching (OM) algorithm is widely used for sequence analysis in sociology. It has a natural interpretation for discrete-time sequences but is also widely used for life-history data, which are continuous in time. Life-history data are arguably better dealt with in terms of episodes rather than as strings of time-unit observations, and in this article, the author examines whether the OM algorithm is unsuitable for such sequences. A modified version of the algorithm is proposed, weighting OM's elementary operations inversely with episode length. In the general case, the modified algorithm produces pairwise distances much lower than the standard algorithm, the more the sequences are composed of long spells in the same state. However, where all the sequences in a data set consist of few long spells, and there is low variability in the number of spells, the modified algorithm generates an overall pattern of distances that is not very different from standard OM.

   Socio-Temporal Patterns
SO SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE optimal matching; costs; entropy; work schedule
ID SEQUENCE-ANALYSIS; TIME; PROSPECT
AB This article addresses the question of the effects of cost setting on the kind of temporal patterns optimal matching (OM) can uncover when applied to social science data. It is argued that the balance between indel (insertion and deletion) and substitution costs determines what kind of socio-temporal pattern can be brought to light. Insertion and deletion operations favor identically coded states irrespective of their locations whereas substitutions focus on contemporaneous similarities. The lower the ratio of substitution to indel costs, the closer OM is to the Hamming distance where only substitutions are used. The higher this ratio, the closer OM is to the Levenshtein II distance, which amounts to finding the longest common subsequence. When the timing of sequences is crucial, substitutions should be favored over indels and their costs should be carefully fixed. Ideally, substitution costs should vary with time to better take into account the timing of the sequences studied. As indels warp time, hence the timing of sequences, it is suggested to use only substitution operations with time-dependent costs inversely proportional to transition frequencies whenever the timing of sequences is central. This OM variant, coined dynamic Hamming matching, is applied to the question of the scheduling of paid work where timing is critical (1985 and 1999 French time use surveys, N = 7,908) along with three classical OM variants (Hamming and Levenshtein I and II). As expected, the two Hamming dissimilarity measures fare better to identify patterns of workday schedules, as measured by entropy, than the two Levenshtein ones.

AB In this article the authors draw attention to the most recent and promising developments of sequence analysis. Taking methodological developments in life course sociology as the starting point, the authors detail the complementary strength in sequence analysis in this field. They argue that recent advantages of sequence analysis were developed in response to criticism of the original work, particularly optimal matching analysis. This debate arose over the past two decades and culminated in the 2000 exchange in Sociological Methods & Research. The debate triggered a "second wave'' of sequence techniques that led to new technical implementations of old ideas in sequence analysis. The authors bring these new technical approaches together, demonstrate selected advances with synthetic example data, and show how they conceptually contribute to life course research. This article demonstrates that in less than a decade, the field has mademuch progress toward fulfilling the prediction that Andrew Abbott made in 2000, that "anybody who believes that pattern search techniques are not going to be basic to social sciences over the next 25 years is going to be very much surprised'' (p. 75).

AB Categorical time series, covering comparable time spans, are often quite different in a number of aspects: the number of distinct states, the number of transitions, and the distribution of durations over states. Each of these aspects contributes to an aggregate property of such series that is called complexity. Among sociologists and demographers, complexity is believed to systematically differ between groups as a result of social structure or social change. Such groups differ in, for example, age, gender, or status. The author proposes quantifications of complexity, based upon the number of distinct subsequences in combination with, in case of associated durations, the variance of these durations. A simple algorithm to compute these coefficients is provided and some of the statistical properties of the coefficients are investigated in an application to family formation histories of young American females.

AB This article uses longitudinal data from the British Cohort Study to examine the early labor market trajectories-the careers-of more than 5,000 women aged 16 to 29 years. Conventional event history approaches focus on particular transitions, the return to work after childbirth, for example, whereas the authors treat female careers more holistically, using sequence methods and cluster analysis to arrive at a rich but readily interpretable description of the data. The authors' typology presents a fuller picture of the underlying heterogeneity of female career paths that may not be revealed by more conventional transition-focused methods. Furthermore, the authors contribute to the small but growing literature on sequence analysis of female labor force participation by using their typology to show how careers are related to family background and school experiences.

AB Definitions of direct and indirect effects are given for settings in which individuals are clustered in groups or neighborhoods and in which treatments are administered at the group level. A particular intervention may affect individual outcomes both through its effect on the individual and by changing the group or neighborhood itself. Identification conditions are given for controlled direct effects and for natural direct and indirect effects. The interpretation of these identification conditions are discussed within the context of neighborhood research and multilevel modeling. Interventions at a single point in time and time-varying interventions are both considered. The definition of direct and indirect effects requires certain stability or no-interference conditions; some discussion is given as to how these no-interference conditions can be relaxed.

ID OPPORTUNITIES; ISSUES
AB Visual research is still a rather dispersed and ill-defined domain within the social sciences. Despite a heightened interest in using visuals in research, efforts toward a more unified conceptual and methodological framework for dealing vigilantly with the specifics of this (relatively) new way of scholarly thinking and doing remain sparse and limited in scope. In this article, the author proposes a more encompassing and refined analytical framework for visual methods of research. The "Integrated Framework'' tries to account for the great variety within each of the currently discerned types or methods. It does so by moving beyond the more or less arbitrary and often very hybridly defined modes and techniques, with a clear focus on what connects or transcends them. The second part of the article discusses a number of critical issues that have been raised while unfolding the framework. These issues continue to pose a challenge to a more visual social science, but can be turned into opportunities for advancement when dealt with appropriately.

AB The value of multiple informant methodology for improving the validity in determining organizational properties has been increasingly recognized. However, the majority of empirical research still relies on single (key) informants. This is partly due to the lack of comprehensive methodological narratives and precise recommendations on the application of this important methodology. Therefore, the authors have developed a critical review and derived clear recommendations for the key challenges that researchers face in using multiple informants: (1) Which and how many informants should be considered? (2) How should the consensus among the informants be judged? (3) How are multiple responses combined into a single, organizational response to conduct further data analyses?

AB This article extends the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method to the decomposition of changes in the wage gap between white and black men over time. The previously implemented technique, in which the contributions of two decomposition components are estimated by subtracting those at time 0 from the corresponding ones at time 1, can yield an untenable conclusion about the extent to which the contributions of the coefficient and endowment effects account for changes in the wage gap over time. This article presents a modified version of Smith and Welch's (1989) decomposition method through which the sources of the change over time are decomposed into five components. The extents to which the education, age, region, metro residence, and marital status variables contribute to the rising racial wage gap between white and black men from 1980 to 2005 are estimated using the five-component detailed decomposition method and are contrasted with the results of the old simple subtraction decomposition technique. In conclusion, this article shows that changes in the racial wage gap between 1980 and 2005 result from many contradicting forces and cannot be reduced to one explanation.

DE ordered probability models; mixture models; latent class; odds ratios
ID LIKELIHOODS; GEOMETRY
AB Cumulative probability models are widely used for the analysis of ordinal data. In this article the authors propose cumulative probability mixture models that allow the assumptions of the cumulative probability model to hold within subsamples of the data. The subsamples are defined in terms of latent class membership. In the case of the ordered logit mixture model, on which the authors focus here, the assumption of a logistic distribution for an underlying latent dependent variable holds within each latent class, but because the sample then comprises a weighted sum of these distributions, the assumption of an underlying logistic distribution may not hold for the sample as a whole. The authors show that the latent classes can be allowed to vary in terms of both their location and scale and illustrate the approach using three examples.

AB Structural equation models are widely used to model relationships among latent unobservable constructs and observable variables. In some studies, the data set used for analysis is comprised of observations that are drawn from a known hierarchical structure and involves missing entries. A two-level structural equation model can be used to analyze such data sets. Direct maximum likelihood methods for analyzing two-level structural equation models are available in software, such as LISREL and Mplus. These software programs also have options to handle missing observations. The authors develop an alternative procedure that uses an expectation maximization (EM) type algorithm. Using appropriate approximations, the procedure can be implemented using simple statistical software in combination with a basic structural equation modeling program. The authors address the implementation of the procedure in detail and provide syntax codes in R, which is available in the public domain, to implement the proposed procedure. The discussion of the procedure is made with reference to the analysis of a data set that studies job characteristic variables. The authors also use simulation studies to examine the performance of the proposed procedure. The results indicate that the proposed method, which is easily accessible to users, represents a reliable alternative for analyzing two-level structural equation models with missing data.

ID SMALL-AREA ESTIMATION; NONRESPONSE; DEMENTIA
AB Population-based surveys are of limited utility to estimate rare or low-incidence groups, particularly for those defined by religion or ethnicity not included in the U.S. Census. Methods of cross-survey analysis and small area estimation, however, can be used to provide reliable estimates of such low-incidence groups. To illustrate these methods, data from 50 national surveys are combined to examine the Jewish population in the United States. Hierarchical models are used to examine clustering of respondents within surveys and geographic regions. Bayesian analyses with Monte Carlo simulations are used to obtain pooled, state-level estimates poststratified by sex, race, education, and age to obtain certainty intervals about the estimates. This cross-survey approach provides a useful and practical analytic framework that can be generalized both to more extensive study of religion in the United States and to other social science problems in which single data sources are insufficient for reliable statistical inference.

ID LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS; DIETARY DATA; WEIGHTS
AB Clogg and Eliason (1987) proposed a simple method for taking account of survey weights when fitting log-linear models to contingency tables. This article investigates the properties of this method. A rationale is provided for the method when the weights are constant within the cells of the table. For more general cases, however, it is shown that the standard errors produced by the method are invalid, contrary to claims in the literature. The method is compared to the pseudo maximum likelihood method both theoretically and through an empirical study of social mobility relating daughter's class to father's class using survey data from France. The method of Clogg and Eliason is found to underestimate standard errors systematically. The article concludes by recommending against the use of this method, despite its simplicity. The limitations of the method may be overcome by using the pseudo maximum likelihood method.

AB Multiequation models that contain observed or latent variables are common in the social sciences. To determine whether unique parameter values exist for such models, one needs to assess model identification. In practice, analysts rely on empirical checks that evaluate the singularity of the information matrix evaluated at sample estimates of parameters. The discrepancy between estimates and population values, the limitations of numerical assessments of ranks, and the difference between local and global identification make this practice less than perfect. In this article, the authors outline how to use computer algebra systems (CAS) to determine the local and global identification of multiequation models with or without latent variables. They demonstrate a symbolic CAS approach to local identification and develop a CAS approach to obtain explicit algebraic solutions for each of the model parameters. The authors illustrate the procedures with several examples, including a new proof of the identification of a model for handling missing data using auxiliary variables. They present an identification procedure for structural equation models that makes use of CAS and that is a useful complement to current methods.

AB The author discusses the general problem of evaluating differences in adjusted survivor functions and develops a heuristic approach to generate the expected events that would occur under a Cox proportional hazards model. Differences in the resulting expected survivor distributions can be tested using generalized log rank tests. This method should prove useful for making other kinds of comparisons and generating adjusted life tables. The author also discusses alternative specifications of the classical Cox model that allow time-varying effects and thus permit a more direct assessment of group differences at various points in time. He implements recently developed semiparametric approaches for estimating time-varying effects, which permit statistical tests of group difference in effects as well as tests of time-invariant effects. He shows that these approaches can provide insight into the nature of time-varying effects and can help reveal the temporal dynamic of group differences.

ID LEVEL
AB As an extension of hierarchical linear models (HLMs), cross-classified random effects models (CCREMs) are used for analyzing multilevel data that do not have strictly hierarchical structures. Proportional reduction in prediction error, a multilevel version of the R(2) in ordinary multiple regression, measures the predictive ability of a model and is useful in model selection. However, such a measure is not yet available for CCREMs. Using a two-level random-intercept CCREM, the authors have investigated how the estimated variance components change when predictors are added and have extended the measures of proportional reduction in prediction error from HLMs to CCREMs. The extended measures are generally unbiased for both balanced and unbalanced designs. An example is provided to illustrate the computation and interpretation of these measures in CCREMs.

ID ANALYZING DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES
AB In this article, the authors demonstrate the utility of an extended latent Markov model for analyzing temporal configurations in the behaviors of a sample of 550 domestic violence batterers. Domestic violence research indicates that victims experience a constellation of abusive behaviors rather than a single type of violent outcome. There is also evidence that observed behaviors are highly dynamic, with batterers cycling back and forth between periods of no abuse and violent or controlling behavior. These issues pose methodological challenges for social scientists. The extended latent Markov method uses multiple indicators to characterize batterer behaviors and relates the trajectories of violent states to predictors of abuse at baseline. The authors discuss both methodological refinements of the latent Markov models and policy implications of the data analysis.

AB In recent years, social scientists have increasingly turned to matching as a method for drawing causal inferences from observational data. Matching compares those who receive a treatment to those with similar background attributes who do not receive a treatment. Researchers who use matching frequently tout its ability to reduce bias, particularly when applied to data sets that contain extensive background information. Drawing on a randomized voter mobilization experiment, the authors compare estimates generated by matching to an experimental benchmark. The enormous sample size enables the authors to exactly match each treated subject to 40 untreated subjects. Matching greatly exaggerates the effectiveness of pre-election phone calls encouraging voter participation. Moreover, it can produce nonsensical results: Matching suggests that another pre-election phone call that encouraged people to wear their seat belts also generated huge increases in voter turnout. This illustration suggests that caution is warranted when applying matching estimators to observational data, particularly when one is uncertain about the potential for biased inference.

AB Many issues of interest to social scientists and policy makers are of a sensitive nature in the sense that they are intrusive, stigmatizing, or incriminating to the respondent. This results in refusals to cooperate or evasive cooperation in studies using self-reports. In a seminal article, Warner (1965) proposed to curb this problem by generating an artificial variability in responses to inoculate the individual meaning of answers to sensitive questions. This procedure was further developed and extended and came to be known as the randomized response (RR) technique. Here, the authors propose a unified treatment for eliciting sensitive binary as well as quantitative information with RR based on a model where the inoculating elements are provided for by the randomization device. The procedure is simple and the authors will argue that its implementation in a computer-assisted setting may have superior practical capabilities.

AB Understanding social phenomena with the help of mathematical models requires a coherent combination of theory, models, and data together with using valid data analytic methods. The study of social networks through the use of mathematical models is no exception. The intuitions of structural balance were formalized and led to a pair of remarkable theorems giving the nature of partition structures for balanced signed networks. Algorithms for partitioning signed networks, informed by these formal results, were developed and applied empirically. More recently, "structural balance'' was generalized to "relaxed structural balance,'' and a modified partitioning algorithm was proposed. Given the critical interplay of theory, models, and data, it is important that methods for the partitioning of signed networks in terms of relaxed structural balance model are appropriate. The authors consider two algorithms for establishing partitions of signed networks in terms of relaxed structural balance. One is an older heuristic relocation algorithm, and the other is a new exact solution procedure. The former can be used both inductively and deductively. When used deductively, this requires some prespecification incorporating substantive insights. The new branch-and-bound algorithm is used inductively and requires no prespecification of an image matrix in terms of ideal blocks. Both procedures are demonstrated using several examples from the literature, and their contributions are discussed. Together, the two algorithms provide a sound foundation for partitioning signed networks and yield optimal partitions. Issues of network size and density are considered in terms of their consequences for algorithm performance.

AB When filter questions are asked to determine respondent eligibility for follow-up items, they are administered either interleafed (follow-up items immediately after the relevant filter) or grouped (follow-up items after multiple filters). Experiments with mental health items have found the interleafed form produces fewer yeses to later filters than the grouped form. Given the sensitivity of mental health, it is unclear whether this is due to respondent desire to avoid sensitive issues or simply the desire to shorten the interview. The absence of validation data in these studies also means the nature of the measurement error associated with the filter types is unknown. We conducted an experiment using mainly nonsensitive topics of varying cognitive burden with a sample that allowed validation of some items. Filter format generally had an effect, which grew as the number of filters increased and was larger when the follow-up questions were more difficult. Surprisingly, there was no evidence that measurement error for filters was reduced in the grouped version; moreover, missing data for follow-up items was increased in that version.

AB Panels of persons who volunteer to participate in Web surveys are used to make estimates for entire populations, including persons who have no access to the Internet. One method of adjusting a volunteer sample to attempt to make it representative of a larger population involves randomly selecting a reference sample from the larger population. The act of volunteering is treated as a quasi-random process where each person has some probability of volunteering. One option for computing weights for the volunteers is to combine the reference sample and Web volunteers and estimate probabilities of being a Web volunteer via propensity modeling. There are several options for using the estimated propensities to estimate population quantities. Careful analysis to justify these methods is lacking. The goals of this article are (a) to identify the assumptions and techniques of estimation that will lead to correct inference under the quasi-random approach, (b) to explore whether methods used in practice are biased, and (c) to illustrate the performance of some estimators that use estimated propensities. Two of our main findings are (a) that estimators of means based on estimates of propensity models that do not use the weights associated with the reference sample are biased even when the probability of volunteering is correctly modeled and (b) if the probability of volunteering is associated with analysis variables collected in the volunteer survey, propensity modeling does not correct bias.

AB Gaining valid answers to so-called sensitive questions is an age-old problem in survey research. Various techniques have been developed to guarantee anonymity and minimize the respondent's feelings of jeopardy. Two such techniques are the randomized response technique (RRT) and the unmatched count technique (UCT). In this study the authors evaluate the effectiveness of different implementations of the RRT (using a forced-response design) in a computer-assisted setting and also compare the use of the RRT to that of the UCT. The techniques are evaluated according to various quality criteria, such as the prevalence estimates they provide, the ease of their use, and respondent trust in the techniques. The results indicate that the RRTs are problematic with respect to several domains, such as the limited trust they inspire and nonresponse, and that the RRT estimates are unreliable due to a strong false no bias, especially for the more sensitive questions. The UCT, however, performed well compared to the RRTs on all the evaluated measures. The authors conclude that the UCT is a promising alternative to RRT in self-administered surveys and that future research should be directed toward evaluating and improving the technique.

AB The list experiment is used to detect latent beliefs when researchers suspect a substantial degree of social desirability bias from respondents. This methodology has been used in areas ranging from racial attitudes to political preferences. Meanwhile, social psychologists interested in the salience of physical attributes to social behavior have provided respondents with experimentally altered photographs to test the influence of particular visual cues or traits on social evaluations. This experimental research has examined the effect of skin blemishes, hairlessness, and particular racial attributes on respondents' evaluation of these photographs. While this approach isolates variation in particular visual characteristics from other visual aspects that tend to covary with the traits in question, it fails to adequately deal with social desirability bias. This shortcoming is particularly important when concerned with potentially charged visual cues, such as body mass index (BMI). The present article describes a novel experiment that combines the digital alteration of photographs with the list experiment approach. When tested on a nationally representative sample of Internet respondents, results suggest that when shown photographs of women, male respondents report differences in levels of attractiveness based on the perceived BMI of the photographed confederate. Overweight individuals are less likely than their normal weight peers to report different levels of attractiveness between high-BMI and low-BMI photographs. Knowing that evaluations of attractiveness influence labor market outcomes, the findings are particularly salient in a society with rising incidence of obesity.

AB Over the past decades there has been an increasing use of panel surveys at the household or individual level. Panel data have important advantages compared to independent cross sections, but also two potential drawbacks: attrition bias and panel conditioning effects. Attrition bias arises if dropping out of the panel is correlated with a variable of interest. Panel conditioning arises if responses are influenced by participation in the previous wave(s); the experience of the previous interview(s) may affect the answers to questions on the same topic, such that these answers differ systematically from those of respondents interviewed for the first time. In this study the authors discuss how to disentangle attrition and panel conditioning effects and develop tests for panel conditioning allowing for nonrandom attrition. First, the authors consider a nonparametric approach with assumptions on the sample design only, leading to interval identification of the measures for the attrition and panel conditioning effects. Second, the authors introduce additional assumptions concerning the attrition process, which lead to point estimates and standard errors for both the attrition bias and the panel conditioning effect. The authors illustrate their method on a variety of repeated questions in two household panels. The authors find significant panel conditioning effects in knowledge questions, but not in other types of questions. The examples show that the bounds can be informative if the attrition rate is not too high. In most but not all of the examples, point estimates of the panel conditioning effect are similar for different additional assumptions on the attrition process.

AB Random digit dialed telephone surveys are facing two serious problems undermining probability-based inference and creating a potential for bias in survey estimates: declining response rates and declining coverage of the landline telephone frame. Optimum survey designs need to focus reduction techniques on errors that cannot be addressed through statistical adjustment. This requires (a) separating and estimating the relative magnitude of different error sources and (b) evaluating the degree to which each error source can be statistically adjusted. In this study, the authors found significant differences in means both for nonrespondents and for the eligible population excluded from the landline frame, which are also in opposite directions. Differences were also found for element variances and associations, which can affect survey results but are rarely examined. Adjustments were somewhat effective in decreasing both sources of bias, although addressing at least one through data collection led to less bias in the adjusted estimates.

AB The authors consider processes on social networks that can potentially involve three factors: homophily, or the formation of social ties due to matching individual traits; social contagion, also known as social influence; and the causal effect of an individual's covariates on his or her behavior or other measurable responses. The authors show that generically, all of these are confounded with each other. Distinguishing them from one another requires strong assumptions on the parametrization of the social process or on the adequacy of the covariates used (or both). In particular the authors demonstrate, with simple examples, that asymmetries in regression coefficients cannot identify causal effects and that very simple models of imitation (a form of social contagion) can produce substantial correlations between an individual's enduring traits and his or her choices, even when there is no intrinsic affinity between them. The authors also suggest some possible constructive responses to these results.

AB Prior work has shown that effective survey nonresponse adjustment variables should be highly correlated with both the propensity to respond to a survey and the survey variables of interest. In practice, propensity models are often used for nonresponse adjustment with multiple auxiliary variables as predictors. These auxiliary variables may be positively or negatively associated with survey participation, they may be correlated with each other, and can have positive or negative relationships with the survey variables. Yet the consequences for nonresponse adjustment of these conditions are not known to survey practitioners. Simulations are used here to examine the effects of multiple auxiliary variables with opposite relationships with survey participation and the survey variables. The results show that bias and mean square error of adjusted respondent means are substantially different when the predictors have relationships of the same directions compared to when they have opposite directions with either propensity or the survey variables. Implications for nonresponse adjustment and responsive designs will be discussed.

ID TROUBLES; ORGANIZATION; QUESTIONS
AB The authors examine how questionnaire structure affects survey interaction in the context of dependent interviewing (DI). DI is widely used in panel surveys to reduce observed spurious change in respondent circumstances. Although a growing literature generally finds beneficial measurement properties, little is known about how DI functions in interviews. The authors systematically observed survey interaction using behavior coding and analyzed an application of DI to obtain respondent employment characteristics. The authors found respondents indicated change in circumstances through a number of verbal machinations, including mismatch answers and explanations. Assessing whether these behaviors influenced subsequent question administration, the authors found qualitative evidence that the information disclosed when negating a DI question leads to subsequent interviewing errors. Quantitative analyses supported this evidence, suggesting that standardized interviewing deteriorates as respondents struggle to identify change in their circumstances. This analysis suggests that the reliability of detail about changed circumstances may not be improved using DI.

ID NESTED ANALYSIS
AB Configurational comparative methods constitute promising methodological tools that narrow the gap between variable-oriented and case-oriented research. Their infancy, however, means that the limits and advantages of these techniques are not clear. Tests on the sensitivity of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) results have been sparse in previous empirical studies, and so has the provision of guidelines for doing this. Therefore this article uses data from a textbook example to discuss and illustrate various robustness checks of results based on the employment of crisp-set QCA and fuzzy-set QCA. In doing so, it focuses on three issues: the calibration of raw data into set-membership values, the frequency of cases linked to the configurations, and the choice of consistency thresholds. The study emphasizes that robustness tests, using systematic procedures, should be regarded as an important, and maybe even indispensable, analytical step in configurational comparative analysis.

ID LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS; SPREAD; OBESITY
AB Analyses of social network data have suggested that obesity, smoking, happiness, and loneliness all travel through social networks. Individuals exert "contagion effects'' on one another through social ties and association. These analyses have come under critique because of the possibility that homophily from unmeasured factors may explain these statistical associations and because similar findings can be obtained when the same methodology is applied to height, acne, and headaches, for which the conclusion of contagion effects seems somewhat less plausible. The author uses sensitivity analysis techniques to assess the extent to which supposed contagion effects for obesity, smoking, happiness, and loneliness might be explained away by homophily or confounding and the extent to which the critique using analysis of data on height, acne, and headaches is relevant. Sensitivity analyses suggest that contagion effects for obesity and smoking cessation are reasonably robust to possible latent homophily or environmental confounding; those for happiness and loneliness are somewhat less so. Supposed effects for height, acne, and headaches are all easily explained away by latent homophily and confounding. The methodology that has been used in past studies for contagion effects in social networks, when used in conjunction with sensitivity analysis, may prove useful in establishing social influence for various behaviors and states. The sensitivity analysis approach can be used to address the critique of latent homophily as a possible explanation of associations interpreted as contagion effects.

AB The model comparison framework of Levy and Hancock for covariance and mean structure models is extended to treat multiple-group models, both in cases in which group membership is known and in those in which it is unknown (i.e., finite mixtures). The framework addresses questions of distinguishability as well as difference in fit of the models with respect to data, first by determining the nature of the models' relation in terms of the families of distributions that constitute the models and then by conducting the appropriate statistical tests. In the case of latent mixtures of groups, the standard likelihood ratio theory does not apply, and a bootstrapping approach is used to facilitate the tests. Illustrations demonstrate the procedures.

ID MEASUREMENT INVARIANCE; MODELS; ATTITUDES; TESTS
AB Three distinctive methods of assessing measurement equivalence of ordinal items, namely, confirmatory factor analysis, differential item functioning using item response theory, and latent class factor analysis, make different modeling assumptions and adopt different procedures. Simulation data are used to compare the performance of these three approaches in detecting the sources of measurement inequivalence. For this purpose, the authors simulated Likert-type data using two nonlinear models, one with categorical and one with continuous latent variables. Inequivalence was set up in the slope parameters (loadings) as well as in the item intercept parameters in a form resembling agreement and extreme response styles. Results indicate that the item response theory and latent class factor models can relatively accurately detect and locate inequivalence in the intercept and slope parameters both at the scale and the item levels. Confirmatory factor analysis performs well when inequivalence is located in the slope parameters but wrongfully indicates inequivalence in the slope parameters when inequivalence is located in the intercept parameters. Influences of sample size, number of inequivalent items in a scale, and model fit criteria on the performance of the three methods are also analyzed.

AB This article reports on an extension of group-based trajectory modeling to address nonrandom participant attrition or truncation due to death that varies across trajectory groups. The effects of the model extension are explored in both simulated and real data. The analyses of simulated data establish that estimates of trajectory group size as measured by group membership probabilities can be badly biased by differential attrition rates across groups if the groups are initially not well separated. Differential attrition rates also imply that group sizes will change over time, which in turn has important implications for using the model parameter estimates to make population-level projections. Analyses of longitudinal data on disability levels in a sample of very elderly individuals support both of these conclusions.

AB In this article, the authors define a methodological framework for analyzing the relationship between state sequences and covariates. Inspired by the principles of analysis of variance, this approach looks at how the covariates explain the discrepancy of the sequences. The authors use the pairwise dissimilarities between sequences to determine the discrepancy, which makes it possible to develop a series of statistical significance-based analysis tools. They introduce generalized simple and multifactor discrepancy-based methods to test for differences between groups, a pseudo-R-2 for measuring the strength of sequence-covariate associations, a generalized Levene statistic for testing differences in the within-group discrepancies, as well as tools and plots for studying the evolution of the differences along the time frame and a regression tree method for discovering the most significant discriminant covariates and their interactions. In addition, the authors extend all methods to account for case weights. The scope of the proposed methodological framework is illustrated using a real-world sequence data set.

ID INTRINSIC ESTIMATOR
AB If a researcher wants to estimate the individual age, period, and cohort coefficients in an age-period-cohort (APC) model, the method of choice is constrained regression, which includes the intrinsic estimator (IE) recently introduced by Yang and colleagues. To better understand these constrained models, the author shows algebraically how each constraint is associated with a specific generalized inverse that is associated with a particular solution vector that (when the model is just identified under the constraint) produces the least square solution to the APC model. The author then discusses the geometry of constrained estimators in terms of solutions being orthogonal to constraints, solutions to various constraints all lying on a line single line in multidimensional space, the distance on that line between various solutions, and the crucial role of the null vector. This provides insight into what characteristics all constrained estimators share and what is unique about the IE. The first part of the article focuses on constrained estimators in general (including the IE), and the latter part compares and contrasts the properties of traditionally constrained APC estimators and the IE. The author concludes with some cautions and suggestions for researchers using and interpreting constrained estimators.

   Age-Period-Cohort Models
SO SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH

DT Article
DE constrained estimators; age-period-cohort models; temporal dimensions;
   intrinsic estimator
ID MORTALITY-RATES; DISEASE RATES
AB In studying temporally ordered rates of events, epidemiologists, demographers, and social scientists often find it useful to distinguish three different temporal dimensions, namely, age (age of the participants involved), time period (the calendar year or other temporal period for recording the events of interest), and cohort (birth cohort or generation). Age-period-cohort (APC) analysis aims to analyze age-year-specific archived event rates to capture temporal trends in the events under investigation. However, in the context of tables of rates, the well-known relationship among these three factors, Period - Age = Cohort, makes the parameter estimation of the APC multiple classification model difficult. The identification problem of the parameter estimation has been studied since the 1970s and still remains in debate. Recent developments in this regard include the intrinsic estimator (IE) method, the autoregressive cohort model, the age-period-cohort-characteristic (APCC) model, the regression splines model, the smoothing cohort model, and the hierarchical APC model. O'Brien (2011; pp. 419452, this issue) makes a further contribution in studying constrained estimators, particularly the IE, in the APC models. The authors, however, have important disagreements with O'Brien as to what the statistical properties of the IE are and how the estimates from the IE should be interpreted. The authors point out these disagreements to conclude the article.

TI Comparisons of Tobit, Linear, and Poisson-Gamma Regression Models: An
   Application of Time Use Data
SO SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Time use data (TUD) are distinctive, being episodic in nature and consisting of both continuous and discrete (exact zeros) values. TUD is non-negative and generally right skewed. To analyze such data, the Tobit, and to a lesser extent, linear regression models are often used. Tobit models assume the zeros represent censored values of an underlying normally distributed latent variable that theoretically includes negative values. Both the linear regression and Tobit models have normality as a key assumption. The Poisson-gamma distribution is a distribution with both a point mass at zero (corresponding to zero time spent on a given activity) and a continuous component. Using generalized linear models, TUD can be modeled utilizing the Poisson-gamma distribution. Using TUD, Tobit and linear regression models are compared to the Poisson-gamma with respect to the interpretation of the model, the model fit (analysis of residuals), and model performance through the use of a simulated data experiment. The Poisson-gamma is found to be theoretically and empirically more sound in many circumstances.

AB The American Sociological Association (ASA) filed an amicus brief in Wal-Mart v. Dukes in which the ASA defended the testimony of the plaintiffs' sociological expert. Unfortunately, the ASA's portrayal and defense of the method and opinions of this expert do not match the actual method used, and opinions offered, by the expert in the Wal-Mart case. The authors demonstrate that none of the ASA's defenses of the expert's method has merit and that the expert violated basic methodological rules set out by the ASA's own sources. The opinions to which the expert testified, therefore, lacked a scientific foundation.

The methods are especially well-suited for snowball sampling of elusive sub-populations. This note describes my experience surveying thousands of Catholics via Facebook in less than a month, at little expense, and without hired help. Although the respondents were disproportionately female, young, educated, and religiously active, their responses preserved key correlations found in standard surveys conducted by Gallup and the GSS.

AB Heywood cases, or negative variance estimates, are a common occurrence in factor analysis and latent variable structural equation models. Though they have several potential causes, structural misspecification is among the most important. This article explains how structural misspecification can lead to a Heywood case in the population, and provides several ways to test whether a negative error variance is a symptom of structural misspecification. The authors consider z-tests based on a variety of standard errors, confidence intervals, bootstrap resampling, and likelihood-ratio-type tests. In their discussion of z-tests, the authors demonstrate which of the standard errors are consistent under different kinds of misspecification. They also introduce new tests based on the scaled chi-square difference: the test on the boundary and the signed root of the scaled chi-square difference. A simulation study assesses the performance of these tests. The authors find that signed root tests and z-tests based on the empirical sandwich and the empirical bootstrap standard errors perform best in detecting negative error variances. They outperform z-tests based on the information matrix or distribution-robust standard errors.

ID COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS QCA; METHODOLOGY
AB This article contributes to the literature on comparative methods in the social sciences by assessing the strengths and weaknesses of regression analysis and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) for studies with a moderately large-n (between approximately 50 and 100). Moderately large-n studies are interesting in this respect since they allow for regression analysis as well as fsQCA analysis. These two approaches have a different epistemological foundation and thereby answer different, yet related, research questions. To illustrate the comparison of fsQCA and regression analysis empirically, I use a recent data set (n = 53) that includes data on the conditions under which governments in Western democracies increase their spending on active labor market policies (ALMPs). This comparison demonstrates that while each approach has merits and demerits, fsQCA leads to a fuller understanding of the conditions under which the outcome occurs.

ID CAUSAL INFERENCE
AB Interference between units may pose a threat to unbiased causal inference in randomized controlled experiments. Although the assumption of no interference is often necessary for causal inference, few options are available for testing this assumption. This article presents an ex post method for detecting interference between units in randomized experiments. With a test statistic of the analyst's choice, a conditional randomization test allows for the calculation of the exact significance level of the causal dependence of outcomes on the treatment status of other units. The robustness of the method is demonstrated through simulation studies. Moreover, using this method, interference between units is detected in a field experiment designed to assess the effect of mailings on voter turnout in a U.S. primary election.

SO SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH

DE causal effect; college entry; heterogeneity
ID EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT; CLASS DIFFERENTIALS; PERCEPTIONS; SWEDEN; CHOICE
AB In recent work in the sociology of education, the primary effects of stratification are defined as the effects of social class origins on preparation for future educational attainment. The secondary effects are then the net direct effects of social class on the transition to the next higher level of education, which are interpreted as average effects of class conditions on students' choices. In this article, the standard model of primary and secondary effects is laid out in explicit form, and primary and secondary effects are then estimated for college entry among recent high school graduates in the United States. The challenges of estimating these effects for educational transitions in the United States are then explained, focusing on the weak warrant for causal inference that is used to justify the calculation of counterfactual net differences across classes. Alternative estimates of associational primary and secondary effects are then offered, after which the prospects for the identification of causal secondary effects by conditioning on additional confounders are assessed. In conclusion, an appeal is made for attention to the policy-relevant patterns of heterogeneity that research on primary and secondary effects may be able to reveal, and a case is made for elaboration and direct identification of the presupposed choice mechanism that has been assumed to generate secondary effects in past research.

DT Article
DE household panel surveys; partial unit nonresponse; inequality; mobility;
   imputation; SOEP
AB In trying to capture complete within-household heterogeneity, household panel surveys typically try to interview all adult household members. Following from this, such surveys tend to suffer from partial unit nonresponse (PUNR), that is, the nonresponse of at least one member of an otherwise participating household, most likely yielding an underestimation of aggregate household income. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), the authors evaluate four different strategies to deal with this phenomenon: (a) ignorance, that is, assuming the missing individual's income to be zero; (b) adjustment of the equivalence scale to account for differences in household size and composition; (c) elimination of all households observed to suffer PUNR and reweighting of households observed to be at risk of but not affected by PUNR; and (d) longitudinal imputation of the missing income components. The aim of this article is to show how the choice of technique affects substantive results in inequality research. The authors find indications of substantial bias on income inequality and poverty as well as on income mobility.

TI Comparing Direct and Indirect Measures of Just Rewards

ID DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE; EARNINGS; PERCEPTIONS
AB We offer the first comparison between "direct" and "indirect" methods for measuring perceptions of distributive justice in reward allocations. The direct method simply asks respondents what they would consider to be a fair salary for a particular person in a given set of circumstances. In contrast, the indirect method infers fair salaries from respondents' judgments about the relative unfairness of hypothetical salaries. The particular indirect method that we will assess is a vignette survey technique pioneered by Jasso and Rossi (1977) and used in a number of more recent publications. The vignettes describe characteristics of a hypothetical employee, with the objective of deriving what respondents believe to be the just reward for that employee. Our experimental test suggests that the two methods yield incompatible results and that neither is immune to bias. The indirect method also suffers from a type of specification error that leads to untenable results. We conclude by suggesting directions for new research to gain a better understanding of these problems and, ultimately, to circumvent them.

AB What do people think is just? A basic element in justice research is the just reward-the observer's idea about what is just for a particular rewardee. But discerning the just reward is not easy; much intervenes between the idea and its expression. Justice theory suggests four classes of measures, one direct and three indirect, each class encompassing several designs for data collection and data analysis. This paper examines direct designs and one of the three classes of indirect designs-that based on the justice evaluation-and revisits the longstanding challenge of justice-evaluation-based indirect designs, namely, to reduce or eliminate the correlation between the actual reward and the unobserved just reward. The paper presents statistical, algebraic, and empirical evidence to show how the factorial survey, with its layers of randomization, protects against bias, mitigating the correlation in the one-reward design and destroying it in the multiple-reward design. Of course, the search for better measures continues. As with length and weight, new theory and new technology will bring new and better measures of the just reward.

Utilizing matching to confront selection into neighborhood environments and instrumental variables to confront selection out of changing neighborhoods, the method is applied to assess the effect of a decline in neighborhood concentrated disadvantage on the economic fortunes of African American children living within changing neighborhoods. Substantive findings indicate that a decline in neighborhood concentrated disadvantage during childhood leads to increases in adult earnings and income, but has no effects on educational attainment or other social outcomes.

AB Bayes factors (BFs) play an important role in comparing the fit of statistical models. However, computational limitations or lack of an appropriate prior sometimes prevent researchers from using exact BFs. Instead, it is approximated, often using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or a variant of BIC. The authors provide a comparison of several BF approximations, including two new approximations, the Scaled Unit Information Prior Bayesian Information Criterion (SPBIC) and Information matrix-based Bayesian Information Criterion (IBIC). The SPBIC uses a scaled unit information prior that is more general than the BIC's unit information prior, and the IBIC utilizes more terms of approximation than the BIC. Through simulation, the authors show that several measures perform well in large samples, that performance declines in smaller samples, and that SPBIC and IBIC provide improvement to existing measures under some conditions, including small sample sizes. The authors illustrate the use of the fit measures with the crime data of Ehrlich and then conclude with recommendations for researchers.

ID DIGIT
AB In this article, "Benford's law" is applied to the "randomized response technique" (RRT) to increase the validity of answers to sensitive questions. Using the Newcomb-Benford distribution as a randomizing device has several advantages. It is easy to explain and follow the procedure, as no physical device such as a coin or a dice is necessary and the method guarantees full anonymity. As is well known, the price for the anonymity of the RRT is a decrease in the efficiency of the estimator. However, because of the subjective overestimation of certain numbers (Benford illusion), the conflict between the variance of the estimates and the degree of anonymity is less pronounced compared to other RRT methods. The suggested RRT variant has the potential to improve the efficiency of the estimator. Moreover, the assumption is that this method works well with self-administered questionnaires.

AB Current research on multiple imputation suggests that including auxiliary variables in the imputation model may increase the accuracy and efficiency of coefficient estimation, yet few studies have actually tested this principle for regression analysis. This article uses data from the 2008 General Social Survey to present results from simulations that vary in three respects: (a) three types of auxiliary variables (variables related to the mechanism of missingness, variables related to the variable/varaibles being imputed, and extraneous variables); (b) three levels of missing data (10 percent, 20 percent, and 30 percent missing); and (c) two assumptions of missing (missing completely at random and missing at random). Results show that the inclusion of any type of auxiliary variable does not appreciably impact the coefficient bias or efficiency in this simulation, regardless of the amount of missing data or the assumption of missing. Hence, the inclusion of auxiliary variables may not be necessary in many analytic situations.

AB We consider the problem of the visualization of life courses represented as sequences. We describe the state of the art and introduce new plots which improve the graphical display of sequences unveiling their most salient features. Our proposal is based upon the application of smoothing techniques, reducing if not completely removing individual noises. The advantages of our plots are illustrated using data from the Panel study of Social Integration in the Netherlands.

AB In the United Kingdom, in order to link individual-level administrative records to survey responses, respondents need to give their consent. Using an unprecedented set of respondent, interview, and interviewer characteristics derived from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) matched with an interviewer survey, this research investigates which characteristics influence consent to adding health and social security records to the survey responses. We find that consent is related to respondents' attitudes to privacy, community mindedness and data linkage salience as well as to some interview features such as the "household contagion effect" and the survey "fidelity." Interviewer characteristics, including their personality, attitudes to persuading respondents, and job experience, are not associated with consent. Interviewers' survey experience in the current wave and their task-specific experience, however, do influence consent. Implications of the findings are discussed and areas for future research are identified.

AB Social scientists have intensely debated the use of deception in experimental research, and conflicting norms governing the use of deception are now firmly entrenched along disciplinary lines. Deception is typically allowed in sociology and social psychology but proscribed in economics. Notably, disagreements about the use of deception are generally not based on ethical considerations but on pragmatic grounds: the anti-deception camp argues that deceiving participants leads to invalid results, while the other side argues that deception has little negative impact and, under certain conditions, can even enhance validity. These divergent norms governing the use of deception are important because they stifle interdisciplinary research and discovery, create hostilities between disciplines and researchers, and can negatively impact the careers of scientists who may be sanctioned for following the norms of their home discipline. We present two experimental studies aimed at addressing the issue empirically. Study 1 addresses the effects of direct exposure to deception, while Study 2 addresses the effects of indirect exposure to deception. Results from both studies suggest that deception does not significantly affect the validity of experimental results.

AB In this article, we extend the propensity score method by matching on multiple groups. Using data from first wave (1987-1988) and third wave (2001-2003) of National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH), we match married individuals with no premarital cohabitation, single premarital cohabitation with the spouse, and serial premarital cohabitations, and apply Cox proportional hazards models to explore how premarital cohabitation history affects marital disruption. Our results indicate that both selection and causation help explain the relationship. The selection effect played a large role in 1987-88 when cohabitation was uncommon but disappeared in 2001-03 when cohabitation became prevalent. Postmatching results demonstrate that the causal effect of cohabitation on marital disruption was strong among serial cohabitors and weak among one-time cohabitors with the spouse. The imputation-based sensitivity analysis shows that our conclusion is robust even with the presence of unobserved characteristics that have a moderate association with cohabitation and marital disruption.

DE Group differences; growth curve models; marginal effects; count data
ID PROBIT; LOGIT
AB To test for group differences in growth trajectories in mixed (fixed and random effects) models, researchers frequently interpret the coefficient of Group-by-Time product terms. While this practice is straightforward in linear mixed models, it is less so in generalized linear mixed models. Using both an empirical example and synthetic data, we show that the coefficient of Group-by-Time product terms in a specific class of mixed models-mixed Poisson models for count outcome variables-estimates the group difference in slope as the multiplicative change with respect to the baseline rates, not differences in the predicted rate of change between groups. The latter can be obtained from computing the marginal effect for the expected response with respect to time by group following model estimation. We propose and illustrate the use of marginal effects to test and interpret group differences in rate of change over time following estimation with mixed Poisson regression models.

AB Social scientists usually assume that the attitudes, behaviors, and statuses of respondents to longitudinal surveys are not altered by the act of measuring them. If this assumption is false-or even if the quality of survey participants' responses change because of measurement-then social scientists risk mischaracterizing the existence, magnitude, and correlates of changes across survey waves in respondents' characteristics. In this article, we make the case that social scientists ought to worry more about panel conditioning biases. We also describe and demonstrate empirical strategies for estimating the magnitude of such biases in longitudinal surveys, and we provide illustrative empirical results that are germane to social science research. We end by outlining a research agenda that would generate specific information about the nature and degree of panel conditioning in specific longitudinal surveys as well as a broader understanding of the circumstances in which panel conditioning is most likely to occur.

AB Survey records are increasingly being linked to administrative databases to enhance the survey data and increase research opportunities for data users. A necessary prerequisite to linking survey and administrative records is obtaining informed consent from respondents. Obtaining consent from all respondents is a difficult challenge and one that faces significant resistance. Consequently, data linkage consent rates vary widely from study to study. Several studies have found significant differences between consenters and nonconsenters on sociodemographic variables, but no study has investigated the underlying mechanisms of consent from a theory-driven perspective. In this study, we describe and test several hypotheses related to respondents' willingness to consent to an earnings and benefit data linkage request based on mechanisms related to financial uncertainty, privacy concerns, resistance toward the survey interview, level of attentiveness during the interview, the respondents' preexisting relationship with the administrative data agency, and matching respondents and interviewers on observable characteristics. The results point to several implications for survey practice and suggestions for future research.

ID HISTORICAL SOCIOLOGY; EXPLANATION; MECHANISMS
AB This article discusses process tracing as a methodology for testing hypotheses in the social sciences. With process tracing tests, the analyst combines preexisting generalizations with specific observations from within a single case to make causal inferences about that case. Process tracing tests can be used to help establish that (1) an initial event or process took place, (2) a subsequent outcome also occurred, and (3) the former was a cause of the latter. The article focuses on the logic of different process tracing tests, including hoop tests, smoking gun tests, and straw in the wind tests. New criteria for judging the strength of these tests are developed using ideas concerning the relative importance of necessary and sufficient conditions. Similarities and differences between process tracing and the deductive-nomological model of explanation are explored.

AB Normal-distribution-based maximum likelihood (ML) and multiple imputation (MI) are the two major procedures for missing data analysis. This article compares the two procedures with respects to bias and efficiency of parameter estimates. It also compares formula-based standard errors (SEs) for each procedure against the corresponding empirical SEs. The results indicate that parameter estimates by MI tend to be less efficient than those by ML; and the estimates of variance -covariance parameters by MI are also more biased. In particular, when the population for the observed variables possesses heavy tails, estimates of variance -covariance parameters by MI may contain severe bias even at relative large sample sizes. Although performing a lot better, ML parameter estimates may also contain substantial bias at smaller sample sizes. The results also indicate that, when the underlying population is close to normally distributed, SEs based on the sandwich-type covariance matrix and those based on the observed information matrix are very comparable to empirical SEs with either ML or MI. When the underlying distribution has heavier tails, SEs based on the sandwich-type covariance matrix for ML estimates are more reliable than those based on the observed information matrix. Both empirical results and analysis show that neither SEs based on the observed information matrix nor those based on the sandwich-type covariance matrix can provide consistent SEs in MI. Thus, ML is preferable to MI in practice, although parameter estimates by MI might still be consistent.

ID MULTILEVEL; MODELS; INFERENCE
AB For the cluster randomized trial, the treatment, implemented at the cluster level, may be hypothesized to impact a final outcome of interest via a mediating variable, with the mediator and outcome being measured typically at the participant level. Two opposing views-one that allows the mediation process to flow through a participant-level mediator and one that does not-have been presented in the literature. We integrate these perspectives and argue that it is the theoretical model and the nature of the mediating variable that determines whether the treatment effect may be mediated by a participant-level or only a cluster-level mediator in this design. An accompanying simulation study shows that when the mediation process is unnecessarily restricted to the cluster level, the power to detect the presence of mediation is substantially reduced.

AB The effect of an independent variable on a dependent variable is often evaluated with hypothesis testing. Sometimes, multiple studies are available that test the same hypothesis. In such studies, the dependent variable and the main predictors might differ, while they do measure the same theoretical concepts. In this article, we present a Bayesian updating method that can be used to quantify the joint evidence in multiple studies regarding the effect of one variable of interest. We apply our method to four studies on how trust in social and economic exchange depends on experience from previous exchange with the same partner. In addition, we examine five hypothetical situations in which the results from the separate studies are less clear-cut than in our trust example.

AB In order to investigate the advantage of mixed-mode (MM) surveys, selection effects between the modes should be evaluated. Selection effects refer to differences in respondent compositions on the target variables between the modes. However, estimation of selection effects is not an easy task because they may be completely confounded with measurement effects between the modes (differences in measurement error). Publications concerning the estimation of these mode effects are scarce. This article presents and compares three methods that allow measurement effects and selection effects to be evaluated separately. The first method starts from existing publications that avoid the confounding problem by introducing a set of mode-insensitive variables into the analysis model. However, this article will show that this method involves unrealistic assumptions in most practical research. The second and the third methods make use of an MM sample extended by comparable single-mode data. The assumptions, advantages, and disadvantages of all three methods are discussed. Each method will further be illustrated using a set of six variables relating to opinions about surveys among the Flemish population. The results show large differences between the methods.

AB Researchers often impute continuous variables under an assumption of normality-yet many incomplete variables are skewed. We find that imputing skewed continuous variables under a normal model can lead to bias. The bias is usually mild for popular estimands such as means, standard deviations, and linear regression coefficients, but the bias can be severe for more shape-dependent estimands such as percentiles or the coefficient of skewness. We test several methods for adapting a normal imputation model to accommodate skewness, including methods that transform, truncate, or censor (round) normally imputed values as well as methods that impute values from a quadratic or truncated regression. None of these modifications reliably reduces the biases of the normal model, and some modifications can make the biases much worse. We conclude that, if one has to impute a skewed variable under a normal model, it is usually safest to do so without modifications-unless you are more interested in estimating percentiles and shape than in estimating means, variances, and regressions. In the conclusion, we briefly discuss promising developments in the area of continuous imputation models that do not assume normality.

AB There are situations where the data or the theory suggest or require, respectively, that one estimate the boundary lines that separate regions of observations from regions of no observations. Of particular interest are ceiling or floor lines. For example, many theories use terms such as veto player, constraint, only if, and so on, which suggest ceilings. Ceiling hypotheses have a nonstandard form claiming the probability of Y will be zero for all values of Y greater than the ceiling value of Yc for a given value of X. Conversely, ceiling hypotheses make no specific prediction about the value of Y for a given value of X except that it will be less than the ceiling value. Floors work by guaranteeing minimum levels. The article gives numerous examples of theories that imply ceiling or floor hypotheses and numerous examples of data that fit such hypotheses. The article proposes quantile regression as a means of estimating the boundaries of the no-data zone as well as criteria for evaluating the importance of the boundary variable. These techniques are illustrated for ceiling and floor hypotheses relating gross domestic product/capita and democracy.

DE duality; interaction identification; profile similarity; statistical

AB We contend that clusters of cases co-constitute statistical interactions among variables. Interactions among variables imply clusters of cases within which statistical effects differ. Regression coefficients may be productively viewed as sums across clusters of cases, and in this sense regression coefficients may be said to be "composed" of clusters of cases. We explicate a four-step procedure that discovers interaction effects based on clusters of cases in the data matrix, hence aiding in inductive model specification. We illustrate with two examples. One is a reanalysis of data from a published study of the effect of social welfare policy extensiveness on poverty rates across 15 countries. The second uses General Social Survey data to predict four different dimensions of ego-network homophily. We find support for our contention that clusters of the rows of a data matrix may be exploited to discover statistical interactions among variables that improve model fit.

AB This article presents a method for estimating and interpreting total, direct, and indirect effects in logit or probit models. The method extends the decomposition properties of linear models to these models; it closes the much-discussed gap between results based on the difference in coefficients method and the product of coefficients method in mediation analysis involving nonlinear probability models models; it reports effects measured on both the logit or probit scale and the probability scale; and it identifies causal mediation effects under the sequential ignorability assumption. We also show that while our method is computationally simpler than other methods, it always performs as well as, or better than, these methods. Further derivations suggest a hitherto unrecognized issue in identifying heterogeneous mediation effects in nonlinear probability models. We conclude the article with an application of our method to data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988.

ID IDENTIFICATION; VARIABLES
AB The increasing availability of data from multisite randomized trials provides a potential opportunity to use instrumental variables (IV) methods to study the effects of multiple hypothesized mediators of the effect of a treatment. We derive nine assumptions needed to identify the effects of multiple mediators when using site-by-treatment interactions to generate multiple instruments. Three of these assumptions are unique to the multiple-site, multiple-mediator case: (1) the assumption that the mediators act in parallel (no mediator affects another mediator); (2) the assumption that the site-average effect of the treatment on each mediator is independent of the site-average effect of each mediator on the outcome; and (3) the assumption that the site-by-compliance matrix has sufficient rank. The first two of these assumptions are nontrivial and cannot be empirically verified, suggesting that multiple-site, multiple-mediator IV models must be justified by strong theory.

AB Using population representative survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and administrative pension records from the Statutory Pension Insurance, the authors compare four statistical matching techniques to complement survey information on net worth with social security wealth (SSW) information from the administrative records. The unique properties of the linked data allow for a straight control of the quality of matches under each technique. Based on various evaluation criteria, Mahalanobis distance matching performs best. Exploiting the advantages of the newly assembled data, the authors include SSW in a wealth inequality analysis. Despite its quantitative relevance, SSW is thus far omitted from such analyses because adequate micro data are lacking. The inclusion of SSW doubles the level of net worth and decreases inequality by almost 25 percent. Moreover, the results reveal striking differences along occupational lines.

ID INTERRATER RELIABILITY
AB Many social science studies are based on coded in-depth semistructured interview transcripts. But researchers rarely report or discuss coding reliability in this work. Nor is there much literature on the subject for this type of data. This article presents a procedure for developing coding schemes for such data. It involves standardizing the units of text on which coders work and then improving the coding scheme's discriminant capability (i.e., reducing coding errors) to an acceptable point as indicated by measures of either intercoder reliability or intercoder agreement. This approach is especially useful for situations where a single knowledgeable coder will code all the transcripts once the coding scheme has been established. This approach can also be used with other types of qualitative data and in other circumstances.

AB This study applies ordinal confirmatory factor analysis for multiple groups to assess equivalence of scale, random errors and systematic (nonrandom) errors of attitudinal questions surveyed on rating scales under different survey modes (Face-to-Face [F2F], Telephone, Paper, and Web). Empirical findings from a large-scale experiment are presented. Consistent with theoretical expectations, interviewer- and self-administered surveys measured all assessed questions on systematically different scales, with different systematic bias, and with differing extents of random error. These measurement effects were absent when comparing Paper with Web or F2F with Telephone. It is concluded that modes impact primarily systematic measurement effects affecting multiple items equally. Interviewer- and self-administered modes should only be combined with great care in mixed-mode surveys that focus on attitudinal constructs. Combining Paper and Web or Telephone and F2F are the viable options. Thereby choosing the self-administered modes appears more efficient, because these modes exhibited higher indicator reliabilities (smaller random error) than the interviewer modes.

AB Many face-to-face surveys use field staff to create lists of housing units from which samples are selected. However, housing unit listing is vulnerable to errors of undercoverage: Some housing units are missed and have no chance to be selected. Such errors are not routinely measured and documented in survey reports. This study jointly investigates the rate of undercoverage, the correlates of undercoverage, and the bias in survey data due to undercoverage in listed housing unit frames. Working with the National Survey of Family Growth, we estimate an undercoverage rate for traditional listing efforts of 13.6 percent. We find that multiunit status, rural areas, and map difficulties strongly correlate with undercoverage. We find significant bias in estimates of variables such as birth control use, pregnancies, and income. The results have important implications for users of data from surveys based on traditionally listed housing unit frames.

AB This article is an empirical contribution to the evaluation of the randomized response technique (RRT), a prominent procedure to elicit more valid responses to sensitive questions in surveys. Based on individual validation data, we focus on two questions: First, does the RRT lead to higher prevalence estimates of sensitive behavior than direct questioning (DQ)? Second, are there differences in the effects of determinants of misreporting according to question mode? The data come from 552 face-to-face interviews with subjects who had been convicted by a court for minor criminal offences in a metropolitan area in Germany. For the first question, the answer is negative. For the second, it is positive, that is, effects of individual and situational determinants of misreporting differ between the two question modes. The effect of need for social approval, for example, tends to be stronger in RRT than in DQ mode. Interviewer experience turns out to be positively related to answer validity in DQ and negatively in RRT mode. Our findings support a skeptical position toward RRT, shed new light on long-standing debates within survey methodology, and stimulate theoretical reasoning about response behavior in surveys.

AB Measurement theorists agree that one has measured well when one's measurement scheme faithfully represents the concept under investigation. Yet, the conventional wisdom on measurement validation pays surprisingly little attention to conceptual meaning and instead emphasizes measurement error and the pursuit of true scores. Researchers are advised to adopt an empiricist stance; treat data as objective facts; and confer validity through predictive correlations. This article offers an alternative outlook on ascertaining goodness in measurement. First, researchers must measure a concept's dimensional expanse. Second, they must contextualize their measures to ensure concept-measure congruence and categorial pertinence. Third, this approach hinges on dialogue among subject matter experts to craft disciplinary measurement norms. The article contrasts these dueling approaches through an extended example of how scholars measure the concept state capacity. Overall, this article argues that social scientists must reconceive what it means to have measured well.

AB Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a method for recruiting hidden populations through a network-based, chain and peer referral process. RDS recruits hidden populations more effectively than other sampling methods and promises to generate unbiased estimates of their characteristics. RDS's faithful representation of hidden populations relies on the validity of core assumptions regarding the unobserved referral process. With empirical recruitment data from an RDS study of female sex workers (FSWs) in Shanghai, we assess the RDS assumption that participants recruit nonpreferentially from among their network alters. We also present a bootstrap method for constructing the confidence intervals around RDS estimates. This approach uniquely incorporates real-world features of the population under study (e.g., the sample's observed branching structure). We then extend this approach to approximate the distribution of RDS estimates under various peer recruitment scenarios consistent with the data as a means to quantify the impact of recruitment bias and of rejection bias on the RDS estimates. We find that the hierarchical social organization of FSWs leads to recruitment biases by constraining RDS recruitment across social classes and introducing bias in the RDS estimates.

AB A multilevel regression model is proposed in which discrete individual-level variables are used as predictors of discrete group-level outcomes. It generalizes the model proposed by Croon and van Veldhoven for analyzing micro-macro relations with continuous variables by making use of a specific type of latent class model. A first simulation study shows that this approach performs better than more traditional aggregation and disaggreagtion procedures. A second simulation study shows that the proposed latent variable approach still works well in a more complex model, but that a larger number of level-2 units is needed to retain sufficient power. The more complex model is illustrated with an empirical example in which data from a personal network are used to analyze the interaction effect of being religious and surrounding yourself with married people on the probability of being married.

AB Within-survey multiple imputation (MI) methods are adapted to pooled-survey regression estimation where one survey has more regressors, but typically fewer observations, than the other. This adaptation is achieved through (1) larger numbers of imputations to compensate for the higher fraction of missing values, (2) model-fit statistics to check the assumption that the two surveys sample from a common universe, and (3) specifying the analysis model completely from variables present in the survey with the larger set of regressors, thereby excluding variables never jointly observed. In contrast to the typical within-survey MI context, cross-survey missingness is monotonic and easily satisfies the missing at random assumption needed for unbiased MI. Large efficiency gains and substantial reduction in omitted variable bias are demonstrated in an application to sociodemographic differences in the risk of child obesity estimated from two nationally representative cohort surveys.

AB Bias in inferences from samples constitutes one of the main sources of error in macrosociological studies. The problem is typically understood as one of "selection bias.'' What constitutes the population available for selection, by contrast, is rarely thought of as being problematic. This article works to remedy this oversight and to demonstrate that this factor is not to be overlooked-suggesting that the categorization of cases constitutes another important source of biased inferences. This article argues that, because the boundaries of most macrosociological concepts are fuzzy, samples formed according to the logic of crisp-set categorization might lead to "categorization bias.'' In order to avoid such a categorization bias, we argue that cases should be weighted depending on how strongly they resemble the prototypes of the categories for which one wants to arrive at generalizations. This article further argues that, by weighting for prototypicality, the logic of fuzzy boundaries of concepts and comparative and statistical methods can be combined. In the process, we provide an example of how weighting by prototypicality can be applied in the area of ethnic studies.

ID MULTIPLE IMPUTATION; MISSING DATA
AB Widely used methods for analyzing missing data can be biased in small samples. To understand these biases, we evaluate in detail the situation where a small univariate normal sample, with values missing at random, is analyzed using either observed-data maximum likelihood (ML) or multiple imputation (MI). We evaluate two types of MI: the usual Bayesian approach, which we call posterior draw (PD) imputation, and a little used alternative, which we call ML imputation, in which values are imputed conditionally on an ML estimate. We find that observed-data ML is more efficient and has lower mean squared error than either type of MI. Between the two types of MI, ML imputation is more efficient than PD imputation, and ML imputation also has less potential for bias in small samples. The bias and efficiency of PD imputation can be improved by a change of prior.

AB Set-theoretic methods and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) in particular are case-based methods. There are, however, only few guidelines on how to combine them with qualitative case studies. Contributing to the literature on multi-method research (MMR), we offer the first comprehensive elaboration of principles for the integration of QCA and case studies with a special focus on case selection. We show that QCA's reliance on set-relational causation in terms of necessity and sufficiency has important consequences for the choice of cases. Using real world data for both crisp-set and fuzzy-set QCA, we show what typical and deviant cases are in QCA-based MMR. In addition, we demonstrate how to select cases for comparative case studies aiming to discern causal mechanisms and address the puzzles behind deviant cases. Finally, we detail the implications of modifying the set-theoretic cross-case model in the light of case-study evidence. Following the principles developed in this article should increase the inferential leverage of set-theoretic MMR.

AB We propose a new multiple imputation technique for imputing squares. Current methods yield either unbiased regression estimates or preserve data relations. Nomethod, however, seems to deliver both, which limits researchers in the implementation of regression analysis in the presence of missing data. Besides, current methods only work under a missing completely at random (MCAR) mechanism. Our method for imputing squares uses a polynomial combination. The proposed method yields both unbiased regression estimates, while preserving the quadratic relations in the data for both missing at random and MCAR mechanisms.

DE middle alternatives; satisficing; neither; nor; don't know
ID KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE
AB A persistent problem in the design of bipolar attitude questions is whether or not to include a middle response alternative. On the one hand, it is reasonable to assume that people might hold opinions which are `neutral' with regard to issues of public controversy. On the other, question designers suspect that offering a mid-point may attract respondents with no opinion, or those who lean to one side of an issue but do not wish to incur the cognitive costs required to determine a directional response. Existing research into the effects of offering a middle response alternative has predominantly used a split-ballot design, in which respondents are assigned to conditions which offer or omit a midpoint. While this body of work has been useful in demonstrating that offering or excluding a mid-point substantially influences the answers respondents provide, it does not offer any clear resolution to the question of which format yields more accurate data. In this paper, we use a different approach. We use follow-up probes administered to respondents who initially select the mid-point to determine whether they selected this alternative in order to indicate opinion neutrality, or to indicate that they do not have an opinion on the issue. We find the vast majority of responses turn out to be what we term `face-saving don't knows' and that reallocating these responses from the mid-point to the don't know category significantly alters descriptive and multivariate inferences. Counter to the survey-satisficing perspective, we find that those with this tendency is greatest amongst those who express more interest in the topic area.

AB Although agree-disagree (AD) rating scales suffer from acquiescence response bias, entail enhanced cognitive burden, and yield data of lower quality, these scales remain popular with researchers due to practical considerations (e.g., ease of item preparation, speed of administration, and reduced administration costs). This article shows that if researchers want to use AD scales, they should offer 5 answer categories rather than 7 or 11, because the latter yield data of lower quality. This is shown using data from four multitrait-multimethod experiments implemented in the third round of the European Social Survey. The quality of items with different rating scale lengths were computed and compared.

AB This special issue of Sociological Methods & Research contributes to recent trends in studies that exploit the availability of multiple measures in sample surveys in order to detect the level and patterning to measurement errors. Articles in this volume focus on topics in one of (or some combination of) the three areas: (1) those that develop and test theoretical hypotheses regarding the behavior of measurement errors under specific conditions of measurement, (2) those that focus on the methodological problems encountered in the design of data collection permitting the estimation of measurement models, and (3) those that focus on the evaluation of existing models for detecting and quantifying the nature of measurement errors. The designs included in these investigations include those that incorporate follow-up probes, record-check studies, multitrait-multimethod designs, longitudinal designs, and latent class models for assessing measurement errors for categorical variables.

AB This article examines the problem of response error in survey earnings data. Comparing workers' earnings reports in the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to their detailed W-2 earnings records from the Social Security Administration, we employ ordinary least squares (OLS) and quantile regression models to assess the effects of earnings determinants and demographic variables on measurement errors in 2004 SIPP earnings in terms of bias and variance. Results show that measurement errors in earnings are not classical, but mean-reverting. The directions of bias for subpopulations are not constant, but varying across levels of earnings. Highly educated workers more correctly report their earnings than less educated workers at higher earnings levels, but they tend to overreport at lower earnings levels. Black workers with high earnings underreport to a greater degree than comparable whites, while black workers with low earnings overreport to a greater degree. Some subpopulations exhibit higher variances of measurement errors than others. Blacks, Hispanics, high school dropouts, part-year employed workers, and occupation switchers tend to misreportboth over- and underreporttheir earnings rather than unilaterally in one direction. The implications of our findings are discussed.

AB This article reports an investigation of errors of measurement in self-reports of financial data in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), one of the major social science data resources available to those who study the demography and economics of aging. Results indicate significantly lower levels of reporting reliability of the composite variables in the HRS relative to those found for summary income approaches used in other surveys. Levels of reliability vary by type of income sourcereports of monthly benefit levels from sources such as Social Security or the Veterans Administration achieve near-perfect levels of reliability, whereas somewhat less regular sources of household income that vary across time in their amounts are measured less reliably. One major area of concern resulting from this research, which may be beneficial to users of the HRS surveys, involves the use of imputation in the handling of missing data. We found that imputation of values for top-end open income brackets can produce a substantial number of outliers that affect sample estimates of relationships and levels of reliability. Imputed income values in the HRS should be used with great care.

ID CLASS MODELS
AB For survey methodologists, latent class analysis (LCA) is a powerful tool for assessing the measurement error in survey questions, evaluating survey methods, and estimating the bias in estimates of population prevalence. LCA can be used when gold standard measurements are not available and applied to essentially any set of indicators that meet certain criteria for identifiability. LCA offers quality inference, provided the key threat to model validitynamely, local dependencecan be appropriately addressed either in the study design or in the model-building process. Three potential causes threaten local independence: bivocality, behaviorally correlated error, and latent heterogeneity. In this article, these threats are examined separately to obtain insights regarding (a) questionnaire designs that reduce local dependence, (b) the effects of local dependence on parameter estimation, and (c) modeling strategies to mitigate these effects in statistical inference. The article focuses primarily on the analysis of rare and sensitivity outcomes and proposes a practical approach for diagnosing and mitigating model failures. The proposed approach is empirically tested using real data from a national survey of inmate sexual abuse where measurement errors are a serious concern. Our findings suggest that the proposed modeling strategy was successful in reducing local dependence bias in the estimates, but its success varied by the quality of the indicators available for analysis. With only three indicators, the biasing effects of local dependence can usually be reduced but not always to acceptable levels.

ID PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION; CULTURE; BEHAVIOR; SOCIOLOGY
AB This article examines the methodological implications of the fact that what people say is often a poor predictor of what they do. We argue that many interview and survey researchers routinely conflate self-reports with behavior and assume a consistency between attitudes and action. We call this erroneous inference of situated behavior from verbal accounts the attitudinal fallacy. Though interviewing and ethnography are often lumped together as "qualitative methods," by juxtaposing studies of "culture in action" based on verbal accounts with ethnographic investigations, we show that the latter routinely attempts to explain the "attitude-behavior problem" while the former regularly ignores it. Because meaning and action are collectively negotiated and context-dependent, we contend that self-reports of attitudes and behaviors are of limited value in explaining what people actually do because they are overly individualistic and abstracted from lived experience.

LA English
DT Article
DE ethnography; conversation analysis; ethnomethodology; interaction order;
   longitudinal ethnography
AB This is a comment suggesting that Jerolmack and Khan's article in this issue embodies news from "somewhere," in arguing that ethnography can emphasize interaction in concrete situations and what people do rather than what they say about what they do. However, their article also provides news from "nowhere," in that ethnography often claims to prioritize in situ organization while dipping into an unconstrained reservoir of distant structures that analytically can subsume and potentially eviscerate the local order. I elaborate on each of these somewhere/nowhere ideas. I also briefly point to the considerable ethnomethodological and conversation analytic research of the last several decades that addresses the structural issue. Such research, along with other traditions in ethnography, suggest that investigators can relate social or political contexts to concrete situations provided that there is, in the first place, preservation of the parameters of everyday life and the exactitude of the local order.

AB Life course perspectives focus on the variation in trajectories, generally to identify differences in variation dynamics and classify trajectories accordingly. Our goal here is to develop methods to gauge the discontinuity characteristics trajectories exhibit and demonstrate how these measures facilitate analyses aimed to evaluate, compare, aggregate, and classify behaviors based on the event discontinuity they manifest. We restrict ourselves here to binary event sequences, providing directions for extending the methods in future research. We illustrate our techniques to data on older drug users. It should be noted though that the application of these techniques is not restricted to drug use, but can be applied to a wide range of trajectory types. We suggest that the innovative measures of discontinuity presented can be further developed to provide additional analytical tools in social science research and in future applications. Our novel discontinuity measure visualizations have the potential to be valuable assessment strategies for interventions, prevention efforts, and other social services utilizing life course data.

AB This article applies coincidence analysis (CNA), a Boolean method of causal analysis presented in Baumgartner (2009a), to configurational data on the Swiss minaret vote of 2009. CNA is related to qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) (Ragin 2008), but contrary to the latter does not minimize sufficient and necessary conditions by means of Quine-McCluskey optimization, but based on its own custom built optimization algorithm. The latter greatly facilitates the analysis of data featuring chain-like causal dependencies among the conditions of an ultimate outcome-as can be found in the data on the Swiss minaret vote. Apart from providing a model of the causal structure behind the Swiss minaret vote, we show that a CNA of that data is preferable over a QCA.

AB Crisp-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis, fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), and multi-value Qualitative Comparative Analysis (mvQCA) have emerged as distinct variants of QCA, with the latter still being regarded as a technique of doubtful set-theoretic status. Textbooks on configurational comparative methods have emphasized differences rather than commonalities between these variants. This article has two consecutive objectives, both of which focus on commonalities. First, but secondary in importance, it demonstrates that all set types associated with each variant can be combined within the same analysis by introducing a standardized notational system. By implication, any doubts about the set-theoretic status of mvQCA vis-a-vis its two sister variants are removed. Second, but primary in importance and dependent on the first objective, this article introduces the concept of the multivalent fuzzy set variable. This variable type forms the basis of generalized-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (gsQCA), an approach that integrates the features peculiar to mvQCA and fsQCA into a single framework while retaining routine truth table construction and minimization procedures. Under the concept of the multivalent fuzzy set variable, all existing QCA variants become special cases of gsQCA.

AB Prepaid monetary incentives are used to address declining response rates in random-digit dial surveys. There is concern among researchers that some respondents will accept the prepayment but not complete the survey. There is little research to understand check cashing and survey completing behaviors among respondents who receive prepayment. Data from the International Tobacco Control Four-Country Study-a longitudinal survey of smokers in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia-were used to examine the impact of prepayment (in the form of checks, approximately US$10) on sample profile. Approximately 14 percent of respondents cashed their check, but did not complete the survey, while about 14 percent did not cash their checks, but completed the survey. Younger adults (Canada and United States), those of minority status (United States), and those who had been in the survey for only two waves or less (Canada and United States) were more likely to cash their checks and not complete the survey.

ID INFERENCE
AB Law and science share many perspectives, but they also differ in important ways. While much of science is concerned with the effects of causes (EoC), relying upon evidence accumulated from randomized controlled experiments and observational studies, the problem of inferring the causes of effects (CoE) requires its own framing and possibly different data. Philosophers have written about the need to distinguish between the "EoC'' and "the CoE'' for hundreds of years, but their advice remains murky even today. The statistical literature is only of limited help here as well, focusing largely on the traditional problem of the "EoC.'' Through a series of examples, we review the two concepts, how they are related, and how they differ. We provide an alternative framing of the "CoE'' that differs substantially from that found in the bulk of the scientific literature, and in legal cases and commentary on them. Although in these few pages we cannot fully resolve this issue, we hope to begin to sketch a blueprint for a solution. In so doing, we consider how causation is framed by courts and thought about by philosophers and scientists. We also endeavor to examine how law and science might better align their approaches to causation so that, in particular, courts can take better advantage of scientific expertise.

AB This article presents an analysis of interviewer effects on the process leading to cooperation or refusal in face-to-face surveys. The focus is on the interaction between the householder and the interviewer on the doorstep, including initial reactions from the householder, and interviewer characteristics, behaviors, and skills. In contrast to most previous research on interviewer effects, which analyzed final response behavior, the focus here is on the analysis of the process that leads to cooperation or refusal. Multilevel multinomial discrete-time event history modeling is used to examine jointly the different outcomes at each call, taking account of the influence of interviewer characteristics, call histories, and sample member characteristics. The study benefits from a rich data set comprising call record data (paradata) from several face-to-face surveys linked to interviewer observations, detailed interviewer information, and census records. The models have implications for survey practice and may be used in responsive survey designs to inform effective interviewer calling strategies.

AB There are over three decades of largely unrebutted criticism of regression analysis as practiced in the social sciences. Yet, regression analysis broadly construed remains for many the method of choice for characterizing conditional relationships. One possible explanation is that the existing alternatives sometimes can be seen by researchers as unsatisfying. In this article, we provide a different formulation. We allow the regression model to be incorrect and consider what can be learned nevertheless. To this end, the search for a correct model is abandoned. We offer instead a rigorous way to learn from regression approximations. These approximations, not "the truth,'' are the estimation targets. There exist estimators that are asymptotically unbiased and standard errors that are asymptotically correct even when there are important specification errors. Both can be obtained easily from popular statistical packages.

ID NONRESPONSE; ERROR
AB Survey methodologists worry about trade-offs between nonresponse and measurement error. Past findings indicate that respondents brought into the survey late provide low-quality data. The diminished data quality is often attributed to lack of motivation. Quality is often measured through internal indicators and rarely through true scores. Using administrative data for validation purposes, this article documents increased measurement error as a function of recruitment effort for a large-scale employment survey in Germany. In this case study, the reduction in measurement quality of an important target variable is largely caused by differential measurement error in subpopulations and respective shifts in sample composition, as well as increased cognitive burden through the increased length of recall periods among later respondents. Only small portions of the relationship could be attributed to a lack of motivation among late or reluctant respondents.

ID SURVEY DESIGN; REGRESSION; QUANTILES; SELECTION
AB Social surveys generally assume that a sample of units (students, individuals, employees,...) is observed by two-stage selection from a finite population, which is grouped into clusters (schools, household, companies,...). This design involves sampling from two different populations: the population of schools or primary stage units and the population of students or second-stage units. Calibration estimators for student statistics can be defined by using combined information based on school totals and student totals. Auxiliary information from the units at the two stages can be calibrated by integrated weighting, as proposed by Lemaitre and Dufour or Estevao and Sarndal. Two calibration estimators for the population total based on unit weights are defined. The first estimator satisfies a calibration equation at the unit level, and the second one, at the cluster level. The proposed estimator shrinks the unit estimator toward the cluster. A simulation study based on two real populations is carried out to study the empirical performance of this shrinkage estimator. The populations studied were obtained from the Programme for International Student Assessment database and from the Spanish Household Budget Survey.

TI Selection Errors of Random Route Samples
SO SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE survey sampling; random route sampling; random walk sampling; selection;
   probability; sampling error; selection error; coverage error
AB Random route samples are widely used in face-to-face surveys. Most previous studies of random route sample quality compare the data collected by random route samples with data from reliable sources, such as the German Microcensus. While these studies usually find few differences in the distributions of demographic variables, it is possible that other substantive variables of interest are biased if random route samples select households with unequal probabilities. This article takes a different approach to assessing the quality of random route samples. Since random routes are used when no complete list of respondents is available, it is assumed that all units have the same selection probability. This assumption is tested, by simulating all possible random routes within a German city and calculating the probability of selection for each household. The simulation results show that all three sets of tested random route instructions lead to strong deviations from a uniform distribution and two create systematic biases.

AB Visualization is a potentially powerful tool for exploration and complexity reduction of categorical sequence data. This article discusses currently available sequence visualization against established criteria for graphical excellence in the visual display of quantitative information. Existing sequence graphs fall into two groups: They either represent categorical sequences or summarize them. The authors propose relative frequency sequence plots as an informative way of graphing sequence data and as a bridge between data representation graphs and data summarization graphs. The efficacy of the proposed plot is assessed by the R-2 and the F statistics. The applicability of the proposed graphs is demonstrated using data from the German Life History Study on women's family formation.

AB Attrition is the process of dropout from a panel study. Earlier studies into the determinants of attrition study respondents still in the survey and those who attrited at any given wave of data collection. In many panel surveys, the process of attrition is more subtle than being either in or out of the study. Respondents often miss out on one or more waves, but might return after that. They start off responding infrequently, but more often later in the course of the study. Using current analytical models, it is difficult to incorporate such response patterns in analyses of attrition. This article shows how to study attrition in a latent class framework. This allows the separation of different groups of respondents, that each follow a different and distinct process of attrition. Classifying attriting respondents enables us to formally test substantive theories of attrition and its effects on data accuracy more effectively.

ID MODEL
AB Storytelling has long been recognized as central to human cognition and communication. Here we explore a more active role of stories in social science research, not merely to illustrate concepts but also to develop new ideas and evaluate hypotheses, for example, in deciding that a research method is effective. We see stories as central to engagement with the development and evaluation of theories, and we argue that for a story to be useful in this way, it should be anomalous (representing aspects of life that are not well explained by existing models) and immutable (with details that are well-enough established that they have the potential to indicate problems with a new model). We develop these ideas through considering two well-known examples from the work of Karl Weick and Robert Axelrod, and we discuss why transparent sourcing (in the case of Axelrod) makes a story a more effective research tool, whereas improper sourcing (in the case of Weick) interferes with the key useful roles of stories in the scientific process.

AB Although the parameters of logit and probit and other nonlinear probability models (NLPMs) are often explained and interpreted in relation to the regression coefficients of an underlying linear latent variable model, we argue that they may also be usefully interpreted in terms of the correlations between the dependent variable of the latent variable model and its predictor variables. We show how this correlation can be derived from the parameters of NLPMs, develop tests for the statistical significance of the derived correlation, and illustrate its usefulness in two applications. Under certain circumstances, which we explain, the derived correlation provides a way of overcoming the problems inherent in cross-sample comparisons of the parameters of NLPMs.

AB Causal inference via process tracing has received increasing attention during recent years. A 2 x 2 typology of hypothesis tests takes a central place in this debate. A discussion of the typology demonstrates that its role for causal inference can be improved further in three respects. First, the aim of this article is to formulate case selection principles for each of the four tests. Second, in focusing on the dimension of uniqueness of the 2 x 2 typology, I show that it is important to distinguish between theoretical and empirical uniqueness when choosing cases and generating inferences via process tracing. Third, I demonstrate that the standard reading of the so-called doubly decisive test is misleading. It conflates unique implications of a hypothesis with contradictory implications between one hypothesis and another. In order to remedy the current ambiguity of the dimension of uniqueness, I propose an expanded typology of hypothesis tests that is constituted by three dimensions.

AB Readability formulas, such as the Flesch Reading Ease formula, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Index, the Gunning Fog Index, and the Dale-Chall formula are often considered to be objective measures of language complexity. Not surprisingly, survey researchers have frequently used readability scores as indicators of question difficulty and it has been repeatedly suggested that the formulas be applied during the questionnaire design phase, to identify problematic items and to assist survey designers in revising flawed questions. At the same time, the formulas have faced severe criticism among reading researchers, particularly because they are predominantly based on only two variables (word length/frequency and sentence length) that may not be appropriate predictors of language difficulty. The present study examines whether the four readability formulas named above correctly identify problematic survey questions. Readability scores were calculated for 71 question pairs, each of which included a problematic (e. g., syntactically complex, vague, etc.) and an improved version of the question. The question pairs came from two sources: (1) existing literature on questionnaire design and (2) the Q-BANK database. The analyses revealed that the readability formulas often favored the problematic over the improved version. On average, the success rate of the formulas in identifying the difficult questions was below 50 percent and agreement between the various formulas varied considerably. Reasons for this poor performance, as well as implications for the use of readability formulas during questionnaire design and testing, are discussed.

AB We welcome Professor Pearl's comment on our original article, Dawid et al. Our focus there on the distinction between the Effects of Causes (EoC) and the Causes of Effects (CoE) concerned two fundamental problems, one a theoretical challenge in statistics and the other a practical challenge for trial courts. In this response, we seek to accomplish several things. First, using Pearl's own notation, we attempt to clarify the similarities and differences between his technical approach and that in Dawid et al. Second, we consider the more practical challenges for CoE in the trial court setting, and explain why we believe Pearl's analyses, as described via his example, fail to address these. Finally, we offer some concluding remarks.

AB Because optimal matching (OM) distance is not very sensitive to differences in the order of states, we introduce a subsequence-based distance measure that can be adapted to subsequence length, to subsequence duration, and to soft-matching of states. Using a simulation technique developed by Studer, we investigate the sensitivity, relative to OM, of several variants of this metric to variations in order, timing, and duration of states. The results show that the behavior of the metric is as intended. Furthermore, we use family formation data from the Swiss Household Panel to compare a few variants of the new metric to OM. The new metrics have been implemented in the freely available TraMineR-package.

AB It is well known that a categorical random variable can be represented geometrically by a simplex. Accordingly, several measures of association between categorical variables have been proposed and discussed in the literature. Moreover, the standard definitions of covariance and correlation coefficient for continuous random variables have been extended to categorical variables. In this article, we present a geometrical framework where both continuous and categorical data are represented by simplices and lines in a high-dimensional space, respectively. We introduce a function whose direct minimization leads to a single definition of covariance between categorical-categorical, categorical-continuous, and continuous-continuous data. The novelty of this general approach is that a single space and a single distance function can be used for describing both continuous and categorical data. It thus provides a unified geometrical description of the measure of association, in particular between categorical and continuous data. We discuss virtues and limitations of such a geometrical framework and provide examples with possible applications to sociological surveys.

AB The dissimilarity index of Duncan and Duncan is widely used in a broad range of contexts to assess the overall extent of segregation in the allocation of two groups in two or more units. Its sensitivity to random allocation implies an upward bias with respect to the unknown amount of systematic segregation. In this article, following a multinomial framework based on the assumption that individuals allocate themselves independently and that unit sizes are not fixed, we provide (1) a mathematical proof of the nonnegativity of the bias, (2) an analytic way of obtaining the same results of a recent bootstrap-based bias correction but without using resampling, and (3) a new bias correction that outperforms, in terms of both bias and mean square error, those based on grouped jackknife, bootstrap, and double bootstrap.

AB There is unexamined potential for developing and testing rival causal explanations in the type of data that participant observation is best suited to create: descriptions of in situ social interaction crafted from the participants' perspectives. By intensively examining a single ethnography, we can see how multiple predictions can be derived from and tested with field notes, how numerous strategies are available for demonstrating the patterns of nonoccurrence which causal propositions imply, how qualitative data can be analyzed to negate researcher behavior as an alternative causal explanation, and how folk counterfactuals can add to the evidentiary strength of an ethnographic study. Explicating the potential of field notes for causal explanation may be of interest to methodologists who seek a common logic for guiding and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research, to ethnographic fieldworkers who aim at connecting micro- to macro-social processes, to researchers who use an analogous logic of explanation when working with other forms of qualitative data, and to comparative-analytic sociologists who wish to form concepts and develop theory in conformity with an understanding that social life consists of social interaction processes that may be captured most directly by ethnographic fieldwork.

AB Agent-based modeling has become increasingly popular in recent years, but there is still no codified set of recommendations or practices for how to use these models within a program of empirical research. This article provides ideas and practical guidelines drawn from sociology, biology, computer science, epidemiology, and statistics. We first discuss the motivations for using agent-based models in both basic science and policy-oriented social research. Next, we provide an overview of methods and strategies for incorporating data on behavior and populations into agent-based models, and review techniques for validating and testing the sensitivity of agent-based models. We close with suggested directions for future research.

ID RANDOM GRAPH MODELS; SOCIAL NETWORKS; SOCIOLOGY
AB Stochastic actor-based models for network dynamics have the primary aim of statistical inference about processes of network change, but may be regarded as a kind of agent-based models. Similar to many other agent-based models, they are based on local rules for actor behavior. Different from many other agent-based models, by including elements of generalized linear statistical models they aim to be realistic detailed representations of network dynamics in empirical data sets. Statistical parallels to micro-macro considerations can be found in the estimation of parameters determining local actor behavior from empirical data, and the assessment of goodness of fit from the correspondence with network-level descriptives. This article studies several network-level consequences of dynamic actor-based models applied to represent cross-sectional network data. Two examples illustrate how network-level characteristics can be obtained as emergent features implied by microspecifications of actor-based models.

AB Autism prevalence has increased rapidly in the United States during the past two decades. We have previously shown that the diffusion of information about autism through spatially proximate social relations has contributed significantly to the epidemic. This study expands on this finding by identifying the focal points for interaction that drive the proximity effect on subsequent diagnoses. We then consider how diffusion dynamics through interaction at critical focal points, in tandem with exogenous shocks, could have shaped the spatial dynamics of autism in California. We achieve these goals through an empirically calibrated simulation model of the whole population of 3- to 9-year-olds in California. We show that in the absence of interaction at these fociprincipally malls and schoolswe would not observe an autism epidemic. We also explore the idea that epigenetic changes affecting one generation in the distal past could shape the precise spatial patterns we observe among the next generation.

AB Noise is widely regarded as a residual categorythe unexplained variance in a linear model or the random disturbance of a predictable pattern. Accordingly, formal models often impose the simplifying assumption that the world is noise-free and social dynamics are deterministic. Where noise is assigned causal importance, it is often assumed to be a source of inefficiency, unpredictability, or heterogeneity. We review recent sociological studies that are noteworthy for demonstrating the theoretical importance of noise for understanding the dynamics of a complex system. Contrary to widely held assumptions, these studies identify conditions in which noise can increase efficiency and predictability and reduce diversity. We conclude with a methodological warning that deterministic assumptions are not an innocent simplification.

AB Since Merton's classical analysis of cumulative advantage in science, it has been observed that status hierarchies display a sizable disconnect between actors' quality and rank and that they become increasingly asymmetric over time, without, however, turning into winner-take-all structures. In recent years, formal models of status hierarchies tried to account for these facts by combining two micro-level, counterbalancing mechanisms: social influence (supposedly driving inequality) and the desire for reciprocation in deferential gestures (supposedly limiting inequality). In the article, we adopt as empirical benchmark basic features that are common to most distributions of status indicators (e.g., income, academic prestige, wealth, social ties) and argue that previous formal models were only partially able to reproduce such macro-level patterns. We then introduce a novel agent-based computational model of deferential gestures that improves on the realism of previous models by introducing heuristic-based decision making, actors' heterogeneity, and status homophily in social interactions. We systematically and extensively study the model's parameter space and consider a few variants to determine under which conditions the macroscopic patterns of interest are more likely to appear. We find that specific forms of status-based heterogeneity in actors' propensity to interact with status-dissimilar others are needed to generate status hierarchies that best approximate these macroscopic features.

AB Mixed-mode designs are increasingly important in surveys, and large longitudinal studies are progressively moving to or considering such a design. In this context, our knowledge regarding the impact of mixing modes on data quality indicators in longitudinal studies is sparse. This study tries to ameliorate this situation by taking advantage of a quasi-experimental design in a longitudinal survey. Using models that estimate reliability for repeated measures, quasi-simplex models, 33 variables are analyzed by comparing a single-mode CAPI design to a sequential CATI-CAPI design. Results show no differences in reliabilities and stabilities across mixed modes either in the wave when the switch was made or in the subsequent waves. Implications and limitations are discussed.

AB Given that the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) is currently one of the most popular measures of goodness-of-model fit within structural equation modeling (SEM), it is important to know how well the RMSEA performs in models with small degrees of freedom (df). Unfortunately, most previous work on the RMSEA and its confidence interval has focused on models with a large df. Building on the work of Chen et al. to examine the impact of small df on the RMSEA, we conducted a theoretical analysis and a Monte Carlo simulation using correctly specified models with varying df and sample size. The results of our investigation indicate that when the cutoff values are used to assess the fit of the properly specified models with small df and small sample size, the RMSEA too often falsely indicates a poor fitting model. We recommend not computing the RMSEA for small df models, especially those with small sample sizes, but rather estimating parameters that were not originally specified in the model.

AB Mixed-mode surveys are known to be susceptible to mode-dependent selection and measurement effects, collectively referred to as mode effects. The use of different data collection modes within the same survey may reduce selectivity of the overall response but is characterized by measurement errors differing across modes. Inference in sample surveys generally proceeds by correcting for selectivityfor example, by applying calibration estimatorsand ignoring measurement error. When a survey is conducted repeatedly, such inferences are valid only if the measurement error remains constant between surveys. In sequential mixed-mode surveys, it is likely that the mode composition of the overall response differs between subsequent editions of the survey, leading to variations in the total measurement error and invalidating classical inferences. An approach to inference in these circumstances, which is based on calibrating the mode composition of the respondents toward fixed levels, is proposed. Assumptions and risks are discussed and explored in a simulation and applied to the Dutch crime victimization survey.

AB The rapid proliferation of cell phone use and the accompanying decline in landline service in recent years have resulted in substantial potential for coverage bias in landline random-digit-dial telephone surveys, which has led to the implementation of dual-frame designs that incorporate both landline and cell phone samples. Consequently, researchers have developed methods to allocate samples and combine the data from the two frames. In this article, we review point and interval estimation methods of proportions that can be used to analyze overlapping dual-frame surveys. We use data from the survey of attitudes toward immigrants and immigration (Opinions and Attitudes of the Andalusian Population regarding Immigration survey), a dual-frame telephone survey conducted in Andalusia, Spain, to explore these different statistical adjustments for combining landline and cell phone samples. Our application obtains good results for calibration, fixed weight, pseudo-empirical likelihood, and single-frame procedures. We recommend that one of these internally consistent estimators be used in practice. The results of these methods of estimation show that the negative image toward immigration continues to spread.

AB The aim of this article is to propose a new breakdown of the Gini inequality ratio into three components (within-group inequality, between-group inequality, and intensity of transvariation between groups to the total inequality index). The between-group inequality concept computes all the differences in salaries between men and women. The main contribution is to show this relationship when dealing with noninteger frequency data appearing on survey data. This article also proves the relationship between the very intuitive Gini concentration ratio and the very commonly used Gini index in the case of discrete distributions with a finite number of observations. The former refers to the relationship between the cumulative proportion of population and income, while the latter is the absolute mean difference divided by twice the arithmetic mean. This article complements the inequality decomposition literature that has stemmed from Gini's work. The research is applied to analyze gender income inequality in a Spanish region using Spanish Structure of Earnings Survey data from 2010.

AB Most intergenerational social mobility studies are based upon retrospective data, in which samples of individuals report socioeconomic information about their parents, an approach that provides representative data for offspring but not the parental generation. When available, prospective data on intergenerational mobility, which are based on a sample of respondents who report on their progeny, have conceptual and practical advantages. Prospective data are especially useful for studying social mobility across more than two generations and for developing joint models of social mobility and demographic processes. Because prospective data remain relatively scarce, we propose a method that corrects retrospective mobility data for the unrepresentativeness of the parental generation and thus permits them to be used for models of social mobility and demographic processes. We illustrate this method using both simulated data and data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. In our examples, this method removes more than 95 percent of the bias in the retrospective data.

   mechanisms; philosophy of explanation
ID GROUNDED THEORY; CAUSALITY; SCIENCE; LOGIC; NEED
AB We propose three interlinked ways that theory helps researchers build causal claims from ethnographic research. First, theory guides the casing and re-casing of a topic of study. Second, theoretical work helps craft a clear causal question via the construction of a contrast space of the topic of investigation. Third, the researcher uses theory to identify social mechanisms that condense causal accounts. We show how each step can accommodate the everyday meanings typically central to ethnographic research's contributions. This tripartite role for theory thus preserves ethnography's traditionally recognized strength in interpretive validity, while realizing ethnography's potential for offering causal, and partly generalizable, accounts that can engage the wider sociological discipline. The discussion brings ethnographic research into conversation with recent debates on the role of mechanisms, comparative and counterfactual thinking in causal accounts. We illustrate and defend our argument for theory in ethnography with an extensive analysis of a contemporary ethnographic monograph along with briefer attention to parallel uses of theory in two other ethnographic studies.

AB Survey respondents' probabilistic expectations are now widely used in many fields to study risk perceptions, decision-making processes, and behavior. Researchers have developed several methods to account for the fact that the probability of an event may be more ambiguous for some respondents than others, but few prior studies have empirically compared the approaches. This article contrasts two of the most prominent methods using data from an experiment embedded in a recent Web survey of 926 volunteer panelists. Specifically, we comparatively evaluate the descriptive and relational properties of ambiguity scores obtained by placing follow-up questions after items eliciting expectations that ask either for (1) a range of probabilities that the respondent is confident to contain the true probability or for (2) a verbal response indicating assuredness. Our results show that these two methods produce measures that have more similarities than differences. Both methods yield ambiguity scores that (1) are not strongly associated with exposure to sources of relevant information, (2) are correlated across seemingly unrelated events, and (3) are consistently related to the level of reported risk.

AB This article combines statistical and applied research perspective showing problems that might arise when measurement error in multilevel compositional effects analysis is ignored. This article focuses on data where independent variables are constructed measures. Simulation studies are conducted evaluating methods that could overcome the measurement error problems. These methods are a multilevel regression model with reliability correction, a multilevel model with plausible values, and a multilevel latent regression model (doubly latent model). While the latter one performs best, all models have their advantages and disadvantages. Examples using data from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study are shown to present the behavior of the tested models in real-data situations and indicate the consequences of ignoring the problem of reliability.

AB In a recent contribution to Sociological Methods & Research, Baumgartner and Epple (B&E) employ Coincidence Analysis (CNA) to explain the outcome of the vote on the Swiss minaret initiative of 2009. Although the authors also present a substantive argument, their principal objective is to prove the superiority of CNA over Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) due to the former's capability of identifying causal chains in configurational data without resort to Quine-McCluskey (QMC) optimization, whereby logical contradictions are allegedly introduced into the latter's minimization process that trivialize the results. In this methodological commentary, I demonstrate that CNA does not challenge QCA per se but merely seeks to find fault with QMC. However, the link between QCA and QMC has never been inextricable, and alternative algorithms not beset by the one-difference restriction B&E consider problematic have long been in use. Hence, it follows that CNA introduces a new algorithm but does not perforce offer a superior method. To support this argument, I showcase the untapped potential of QCA for identifying causal chains in data that even incorporate multivalent factors. In employing the eQMC algorithm, whose general approach to Boolean minimization resembles that of CNA in decisive parts, I extend the authors' original analysis in several directions, without generating logical contradictions along the way. I conclude that future research should continue to explore the methodological implications of the issues which CNA's introduction has raised for QCA. Ultimately, however, the integration of their individual strengths represents one of the most promising avenues for the further development of configurational comparative methods.

AB This study compares the performance of two approaches in analysing four-point Likert rating scales with a factorial model: the classical factor analysis (FA) and the item factor analysis (IFA). For FA, maximum likelihood and weighted least squares estimations using Pearson correlation matrices among items are compared. For IFA, diagonally weighted least squares and unweighted least squares estimations using items polychoric correlation matrices are compared. Two hundred and ten conditions were simulated in a Monte Carlo study considering: one to three factor structures (either, independent and correlated in two levels), medium or low quality of items, three different levels of item asymmetry and five sample sizes. Results showed that IFA procedures achieve equivalent and accurate parameter estimates; in contrast, FA procedures yielded biased parameter estimates. Therefore, we do not recommend classical FA under the conditions considered. Minimum requirements for achieving accurate results using IFA procedures are discussed.

AB With one treated and one untreated periods, difference in differences (DD) requires the untreated response changes to be the same across the treatment and control groups, if the treatment were withheld contrary to the fact. A natural way to check the condition is to backtrack one period and examine the response changes in two pretreatment periods. If the condition does not hold in the pretreatment periods, then a modified DD takes the form of "generalized difference in differences (GDD),'' which is a triple difference (TD) with one more time-wise difference than DD. GDD generalizes DD with a weaker identification condition in the sense that a time-constant, but not necessarily zero, time/selection effect is allowed. One more time-wise differencing (quadruple difference [QD]) than GDD allows for the time/selection effect even to change over time, which makes it possible to test for the GDD identification condition. Simple panel least squares estimators (LSEs)/tests for DD and GDD are proposed and an empirical illustration is presented.

AB Since the seminal introduction of the propensity score (PS) by Rosenbaum and Rubin, PS-based methods have been widely used for drawing causal inferences in the behavioral and social sciences. However, the PS approach depends on the ignorability assumption: there are no unobserved confounders once observed covariates are taken into account. For situations where this assumption may be violated, Heckman and his associates have recently developed a novel approach based on marginal treatment effects (MTEs). In this article, we (1) explicate the consequences for PS-based methods when aspects of the ignorability assumption are violated, (2) compare PS-based methods and MTE-based methods by making a close examination of their identification assumptions and estimation performances, (3) apply these two approaches in estimating the economic return to college using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) of 1979 and discuss their discrepancies in results. When there is a sorting gain but no systematic baseline difference between treated and untreated units given observed covariates, PS-based methods can identify the treatment effect of the treated (TT). The MTE approach performs best when there is a valid and strong instrumental variable (IV). In addition, this article introduces the "smoothing-difference PS-based method,'' which enables us to uncover heterogeneity across people of different PSs in both counterfactual outcomes and treatment effects.

AB This article describes (1) the survey methodological and statistical characteristics of the nonrandomized method for surveying sensitive questions for both cross-sectional and panel survey data and (2) the way to use the incompletely observed variable obtained from this survey method in logistic regression and in loglinear and log-multiplicative association models. The nonrandomized method, which was introduced by Yu, Tian, and Tang and Tian et al. for surveying sensitive questions, is much more efficient than randomized response methods, and unlike the latter, the former can be included in a mail survey. The method also has unique advantages compared with the randomized response method for the analysis of panel survey data. A simulation analysis presents how the relative efficiency of statistics in the analysis of data collected with this method changes as a function of mixing probability compared with a hypothetical situation of collecting responses of a sensitive question from every sample subject. The use of statistical software for the application of the logistic regression model, with an incompletely observed variable from cross-sectional and panel surveys, is also described.

ID OPPORTUNITY
AB To explain the inequalities in access to a discrete good G across two populations, or across time in a single national context, it is necessary to distinguish, for each population or period of time, the effect of the diffusion of G from that of unequal outcomes of underlying micro-social processes. The inequality of outcomes of these micro-social processes is termed inequality within the selection process. We present an innovative index of measurement that captures variations in this aspect of inequality of opportunity and is insensitive to margins. We applied this index to the analysis of inequality of educational opportunity by exploring the effects of the British 1944 Education Act, of which various accounts have been offered. The relationships between the measure of inequality within a selection process presented and classical measures of inequality of opportunity are analyzed, as well as the benefits of using this index with regard to the insight it provides for interpreting data.

ID IMPUTATION
AB Obtaining predictions from regression models fit to multiply imputed data can be challenging because treatments of multiple imputation seldom give clear guidance on how predictions can be calculated, and because available software often does not have built-in routines for performing the necessary calculations. This research note reviews how predictions can be obtained using Rubin's rules, that is, by being estimated separately in each imputed data set and then combined. It then demonstrates that predictions can also be calculated directly from the final analysis model. Both approaches yield identical results when predictions rely solely on linear transformations of the coefficients and calculate standard errors using the delta method and diverge only slightly when using nonlinear transformations. However, calculation from the final model is faster, easier to implement, and generates predictions with a clearer relationship to model coefficients. These principles are illustrated using data from the General Social Survey and with a simulation.

AB Extant research comparing survey self-reports of normative behavior to direct observations and time diary data have yielded evidence of extensive measurement bias. However, most of this research program has relied on observational data, comparing independent samples from the same target population, rather than comparing survey self-reports to a criterion measure for individual respondents. This research addresses the next step using data from two studies. In each study, respondents completed a conventional survey questionnaire, including questions about frequency of religious behavior. Respondents were then asked to participate in a text messaging (short message service) data collection procedure, reporting either (1) participation in religious behavior specifically or (2) all changes in major activity without explicitly specifying religious behavior. Findings suggest that directive measurement, priming the respondent to consider the focal behavior, is a cause of measurement bias.

AB This article specifies a multilevel measurement model for survey response when data are nested. The model includes a test-retest model of reliability, a confirmatory factor model of interitem reliability with item-specific bias effects, an individual-level model of the biasing effects due to respondent characteristics, and a neighborhood-level model of construct validity. We apply this model for measuring informal social control within collective efficacy theory. Estimating the model on 3,260 respondents nested within 123 Seattle neighborhoods, we find that measures of informal control show reasonable test-retest and interitem reliability. We find support for the hypothesis that respondents' assessments of whether their neighbors would intervene in specific child deviant acts are related to whether they have observed such acts in the past, which is consistent with a cognitive model of survey response. Finally, we find that, when proper measurement models are not used, the effects of some neighborhood covariates on informal control are biased upward and the effect of informal social control on violence is biased downward.

AB Despite their long trajectory in the social sciences, few systematic works analyze how often and for what purposes focus groups appear in published works. This study fills this gap by undertaking a meta-analysis of focus group use over the last 10 years. It makes several contributions to our understanding of when and why focus groups are used in the social sciences. First, the study explains that focus groups generate data at three units of analysis, namely, the individual, the group, and the interaction. Although most researchers rely upon the individual unit of analysis, the method's comparative advantage lies in the group and interactive units. Second, it reveals strong affinities between each unit of analysis and the primary motivation for using focus groups as a data collection method. The individual unit of analysis is appropriate for triangulation; the group unit is appropriate as a pretest; and the interactive unit is appropriate for exploration. Finally, it offers a set of guidelines that researchers should adopt when presenting focus groups as part of their research design. Researchers should, first, state the main purpose of the focus group in a research design; second, identify the primary unit of analysis exploited; and finally, list the questions used to collect data in the focus group.

AB Given their capacity to identify causal relationships, experimental audit studies have grown increasingly popular in the social sciences. Typically, investigators send fictitious auditors who differ by a key factor (e.g., race) to particular experimental units (e.g., employers) and then compare treatment and control groups on a dichotomous outcome (e.g., hiring). In such scenarios, an important design consideration is the power to detect a certain magnitude difference between the groups. But power calculations are not straightforward in standard matched tests for dichotomous outcomes. Given the paired nature of the data, the number of pairs in the concordant cells (when neither or both auditor receives a positive response) contributes to the power, which is lower as the sum of the discordant proportions approaches one. Because these quantities are difficult to determine a priori, researchers must exercise particular care in experimental design. We here present sample size and power calculations for McNemar's test using empirical data from an audit study on misdemeanor arrest records and employability. We then provide formulas and examples for cases involving more than two treatments (Cochran's Q test) and nominal outcomes (Stuart-Maxwell test). We conclude with concrete recommendations concerning power and sample size for researchers designing and presenting matched audit studies.

AB The factorial survey is an experimental design consisting of varying situations (vignettes) that have to be judged by respondents. For more complex research questions, it quickly becomes impossible for an individual respondent to judge all vignettes. To overcome this problem, random designs are recommended most of the time, whereas quota designs are not discussed at all. First comparisons of random designs with fractional factorial and D-efficient designs are based on fictitious data, first comparisons with fractional factorial and confounded factorial designs are restricted to theoretical considerations. The aim of this contribution is to compare different designs regarding their reliability and their internal validity. The benchmark for the empirical comparison is established by the estimators from a parsimonious full factorial design, each answered by a sample of 132 students (real instead of fictitious data). Multilevel analyses confirm that, if they exist, balanced confounded factorial designs are ideal. A confounded D-efficient design, as proposed for the first time in this article, is also superior to simple random designs.

ID QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; COMPARATIVE POLITICS; STRATEGY
AB Qualitative and multimethod scholars face a wide and often confusing array of alternatives for case selection using the results of a prior regression analysis. Methodologists have recommended alternatives including selection of typical cases, deviant cases, extreme cases on the independent variable, extreme cases on the dependent variable, influential cases, most similar cases, most different cases, pathway cases, and randomly sampled cases, among others. Yet this literature leaves it substantially unclear which of these approaches is best for any particular goal. Via statistical modeling and simulation, I argue that the rarely considered approach of selecting cases with extreme values on the main independent variable, as well as the more commonly discussed deviant case design, are the best alternatives for a broad range of discovery-related goals. By contrast, the widely discussed and advocated typical case, extreme-on-Y, and most similar cases approaches to case selection are much less valuable than scholars in the qualitative and multimethods research traditions have recognized to date.

AB This article shows how statistical matching methods can be used to select most similar cases for qualitative analysis. I first offer a methodological justification for research designs based on selecting most similar cases. I then discuss the applicability of existing matching methods to the task of selecting most similar cases and propose adaptations to meet the unique requirements of qualitative analysis. Through several applications, I show that matching methods have advantages over traditional selection in most similar case designs: They ensure that most similar cases are in fact most similar; they make scope conditions, assumptions, and measurement explicit; and they make case selection transparent and replicable.

AB We delineate the underlying homogeneity assumption, procedural variants, and implications of the comparative method and distinguish this from Mill's method of difference. We demonstrate that additional units can provide placebo tests for the comparative method even if the scope of inference is limited to the two units under comparison. Moreover, such tests may be available even when these units are the most similar pair of units on the control variables with differing values of the independent variable. Small-n analyses using this method should therefore, at a minimum, clearly define the dependent, independent, and control variables so they may be measured for additional units, and specify how the control variables are weighted in defining similarity between units. When these tasks are too difficult, process tracing of a single unit may be a more appropriate method. We illustrate these points with applications to two studies.

AB This study revisits the task of case selection in case study research, proposing a new typology of strategies that is explicit, disaggregated, and relatively comprehensive. A secondary goal is to explore the prospects for case selection by algorithm, aka ex ante, automatic, quantitative, systematic, or model-based case selection. We lay out a suggested protocol and then discuss its viability. Our conclusion is that it is a valuable tool in certain circumstances, but should probably not determine the final choice of cases unless the chosen sample is medium-sized. Our third goal is to discuss the viability of medium-n samples for case study research, an approach closely linked to algorithmic case selection and occasionally practiced by case study researchers. We argue that medium-n samples occupy an unstable methodological position, lacking the advantages of efficiency promised by traditional, small-n case studies but also lacking the advantages of representativeness promised by large-n samples.

TI Pathway Analysis and the Search for Causal Mechanisms

DE causal mechanisms; mixed-method research; case selection; hypotheses
   generation; qualitative methods
AB The study of causal mechanisms interests scholars across the social sciences. Case studies can be a valuable tool in developing knowledge and hypotheses about how causal mechanisms function. The usefulness of case studies in the search for causal mechanisms depends on effective case selection, and there are few existing guidelines for selecting cases to study causal mechanisms. We outline a general approach for selecting cases for pathway analysis: a mode of qualitative research that is part of a mixed-method research agenda, which seeks to (1) understand the mechanisms or links underlying an association between some explanatory variable, X1, and an outcome, Y, in particular cases and (2) generate insights from these cases about mechanisms in the unstudied population of cases featuring the X1/Y relationship. The gist of our approach is that researchers should choose cases for comparison in light of two criteria. The first criterion is the expected relationship between X1/Y, which is the degree to which cases are expected to feature the relationship of interest between X1 and Y. The second criterion is variation in case characteristics or the extent to which the cases are likely to feature differences in characteristics that can facilitate hypothesis generation. We demonstrate how to apply our approach and compare it to a leading example of pathway analysis in the so-called resource curse literature, a prominent example of a correlation featuring a nonlinear relationship and multiple causal mechanisms.

ID CAUSAL INFERENCE
AB Case studies appear prominently in political science, sociology, and other social science fields. A scholar employing a case study research design in an effort to estimate causal effects must confront the question, how should cases be selected for analysis? This question is important because the results derived from a case study research program ultimately and unavoidably rely on the criteria used to select the cases. While the matter of case selection is at the forefront of research on case study design, an analytical framework that can address it in a comprehensive way has yet to be produced. We develop such a framework and use it to evaluate nine common case selection methods. Our simulation-based results show that the methods of simple random sampling, influential case selection, and diverse case selection generally outperform other common methods. And, when a research design mandates that only a very small number of cases, say one or two, be selected in the course of a research program, the very simple method of sampling from the largest cell of a 2 x 2 table is competitive with other, more complicated, case selection methods. We show as well that a number of common case selection strategies work well only in idiosyncratic situations, and we argue that these methods should be abandoned in favor of the more powerful and robust case selection methods that our analytical framework identifies.

AB Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) is a method for cross-case analyses that works best when complemented with follow-up case studies focusing on the causal quality of the solution and its constitutive terms, the underlying causal mechanisms, and potentially omitted conditions. The anchorage of QCA in set theory demands criteria for follow-up case studies that are different from those known from regression-based multimethod research (MMR). Based on the evolving research on set-theoretic MMR, we introduce principles for formalized case selection and causal inference after a fuzzy-set QCA on sufficiency. Using an empirical example for illustration, we elaborate on the principles of counterfactuals for intelligible causal inference in the analysis of three different types of cases. Furthermore, we explain how case-based counterfactual inferences on the basis of QCA solutions are related to counterfactuals in the course of processing a truth table in order to produce a solution. We then flesh out two important functions that ideal types play for QCA-based case studies: First, they inform the development of formulas for the choice of the best available cases for with-case analysis and, second, establish the boundaries of generalization of the causal inferences.

AB Effects of rating scale forms on cross-sectional reliability and measurement equivalence were investigated. A randomized experimental design was implemented, varying category labels and number of categories. The participants were 800 students at two German universities. In contrast to previous research, reliability assessment method was used, which relies on the congeneric measurement model. The experimental manipulation had differential effects on the reliability scores and measurement equivalence. Attitude strength seems to be a relevant moderator variable, which influences measurement equivalence. Overall, the results show that measurement quality is influenced by rating scale forms. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for latent variables measurement.

AB One interesting idea in social network analysis is the directionality test that utilizes the directions of social ties to help identify peer effects. The null hypothesis of the test is that if contextual factors are the only force that affects peer outcomes, the estimated peer effects should not differ, if the directions of social ties are reversed. In this article, I statistically formalize this test and investigate its properties under various scenarios. In particular, I point out the validity of the test is contingent on the presence of peer selection, sampling error, and simultaneity bias. I also outline several methods that can help provide causal estimates of peer effects in social networks.

AB The use of controlled comparisons pervades comparative historical analysis. Heated debates have surrounded the methodological purchase of such comparisons. However, the quality and validity of the conceptual building blocks on which the comparisons are based have largely been ignored. This article discusses a particular problem pertaining to these issues, that is, the danger of creating false historical analogies that do not serve to control for relevant explanatory factors. It is argued that this danger increases when we use composite (thick) concepts that are aggregated via a (loose) family resemblance logic. It is demonstrated that this problem seriously affects the way the concept of feudalism has entered comparative historical analysis. On this basis, an alternative conceptual strategycentered on teasing out the core attributes of thick and loose conceptsis proposed.

AB Age-period-cohort (APC) models are designed to estimate the independent effects of age, time periods, and cohort membership. However, APC models suffer from an identification problem: There are no unique estimates of the independent effects that fit the data best because of the exact linear dependency among age, period, and cohort. Among methods proposed to address this problem, using unequal-interval widths for age, period, and cohort categories appears to break the exact linear dependency and thus solve the identification problem. However, this article shows that the identification problem remains in these models; in fact, they just implicitly impose multiple block constraints on the age, period, and cohort effects to achieve identifiability. These constraints depend on an arbitrary choice of widths for the age, period, and cohort intervals and can have nontrivial effects on the estimates. Because these assumptions are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to verify in empirical research, they are qualitatively no different from the assumptions of other constrained estimators. Therefore, the unequal-intervals approach should not be used without an explicit rationale justifying their constraints.

AB Model uncertainty is pervasive in social science. A key question is how robust empirical results are to sensible changes in model specification. We present a new approach and applied statistical software for computational multimodel analysis. Our approach proceeds in two steps: First, we estimate the modeling distribution of estimates across all combinations of possible controls as well as specified functional form issues, variable definitions, standard error calculations, and estimation commands. This allows analysts to present their core, preferred estimate in the context of a distribution of plausible estimates. Second, we develop a model influence analysis showing how each model ingredient affects the coefficient of interest. This shows which model assumptions, if any, are critical to obtaining an empirical result. We demonstrate the architecture and interpretation of multimodel analysis using data on the union wage premium, gender dynamics inmortgage lending, and tax flightmigration among U.S. states. These illustrate how initial results can be strongly robust to alternative model specifications or remarkably dependent on a knife-edge specification.

AB The recent change in the general social survey (GSS) to a rotating panel design is a landmark development for social scientists. Sociological methodologists have argued that fixed-effects (FE) models are generally the best starting point for analyzing panel data because they allow analysts to control for unobserved time-constant heterogeneity. We review these treatments and demonstrate the advantages of FE models in the context of the GSS. We also show, however, that FE models have two rarely tested assumptions that can seriously bias parameter estimates when violated. We provide simple tests for these assumptions. We further demonstrate that FE models are extremely sensitive to the correct specification of temporal lags. We provide a simulation and a proof to show that the use of incorrect lags in FE models can lead to coefficients that are the opposite sign of the true parameter values.

AB In this article, we review popular parametric models for analyzing panel data and introduce the latest advances in matching methods for panel data analysis. To the extent that the parametric models and the matching methods offer distinct advantages for drawing causal inference, we suggest using both to cross-validate the evidence. We demonstrate how to use these methods by examining race-of-interviewer effects (ROIE) in the 2006 to 2010 panel data of the General Social Survey. We find that ROIE mostly concentrate on race-related outcomes and may vary by respondent's race for some outcomes. But we find no statistically significant evidence that ROIE vary by the interview mode (i.e., in person vs. by phone). Our study has both methodological and substantive implications for future research.

AB Does participation in one wave of a survey have an effect on respondents' answers to questions in subsequent waves? In this article, we investigate the presence and magnitude of "panel conditioning'' effects in one of the most frequently used data sets in the social sciences: the General Social Survey (GSS). Using longitudinal records from the 2006, 2008, and 2010 surveys, we find convincing evidence that at least some GSS items suffer from this form of bias. To rule out the possibility of contamination due to selective attrition and/ or unobserved heterogeneity, we strategically exploit a series of between-person comparisons across time-in-survey groups. This methodology, which can be implemented whenever researchers have access to at least three waves of rotating panel data, is described in some detail so as to facilitate future applications in data sets with similar design elements.

AB The positive relationship between family formation and regular weekly religious service attendance is well established, but cross-sectional data make it difficult to be confident that this relationship is causal. Moreover, if the relationship is causal, cross-sectional datamake it difficult to disentangle the effects of three distinct family-formation events: marrying, having a child, and having a child who reaches school age. We use three waves of the new General Social Survey panel data to disentangle these separate potential effects. Using random-, fixed-, and hybrid-effect models, we show that, although in crosssection marriage and children predict attendance across individuals, neither leads to increased attendance when looking at individuals who change over time. Having a child who becomes school aged is the only family-formation event that remains associated with increased attendance among individuals who change over time. This suggests that the relationships between marriage and attending and between having a first child (or, for that matter, having several children) and attending are spurious, causal in the other direction, or indirect (since marrying and having a first child make it more likely that one will eventually have a school-age child). Adding a school-age child in the household is the only family-formation event that directly leads to increased attendance.

AB Areal data have been used to good effect in a wide range of sociological research. One of the most persistent problems associated with this type of data, however, is the need to combine data sets with incongruous boundaries. To help address this problem, we introduce a new method for identifying common geographies. We show that identifying common geographies is equivalent to identifying components within a k-uniform k-partite hypergraph. This approach can be easily implemented using a geographic information system in conjunction with a simple search algorithm.

AB Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental designs like regression discontinuity (RD) designs, instrumental variable (IV) designs, and matching and propensity score (PS) designs are frequently used for inferring causal effects. It is well known that the features of these designs facilitate the identification of a causal estimand and, thus, warrant a causal interpretation of the estimated effect. In this article, we discuss and compare the identifying assumptions of quasi-experiments using causal graphs. The increasing complexity of the causal graphs as one switches from an RCT to RD, IV, or PS designs reveals that the assumptions become stronger as the researcher's control over treatment selection diminishes. We introduce limiting graphs for the RD design and conditional graphs for the latent subgroups of compliers, always takers, and never takers of the IV design, and argue that the PS is a collider that offsets confounding bias via collider bias.

AB Social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter provide an unprecedented amount of qualitative data about organizations and collective behavior. Yet these new data sources lack critical information about the broader social context of collective behavior-or protect it behind strict privacy barriers. In this article, I introduce social media survey apps (SMSAs) that adjoin computational social science methods with conventional survey techniques in order to enable more comprehensive analysis of collective behavior online. SMSAs (1) request large amounts of public and non-public data from organizations that maintain social media pages, (2) survey these organizations to collect additional data of interest to a researcher, and (3) return the results of a scholarly analysis back to these organizations as incentive for them to participate in social science research. SMSAs thus provide a highly efficient, cost-effective, and secure method for extracting detailed data from very large samples of organizations that use social media sites. This article describes how to design and implement SMSAs and discusses an application of this new method to study how nonprofit organizations attract public attention to their cause on Facebook. I conclude by evaluating the quality of the sample derived from this application of SMSAs and discussing the potential of this new method to study non-organizational populations on social media sites as well.

AB Measuring values in sociological research sometimes involves the use of ranking data. A disadvantage of a ranking assignment is that the order in which the items are presented might influence the choice preferences of respondents regardless of the content being measured. The standard procedure to rule out such effects is to randomize the order of items across respondents. However, implementing this design may be impractical and the biasing impact of a response order effect cannot be evaluated. We use a latent choice factor (LCF) model that allows statistically controlling for response order effects. Furthermore, the model adequately deals with the known issue of ipsativity of ranking data. Applying this model to a Dutch survey on work values, we show that a primacy effect accounts for response order bias in item preferences. Our findings demonstrate the usefulness of the LCF model in modeling ranking data while taking into account particular response biases.

AB Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) has become one of the most prominent methods in the social sciences for capturing causal complexity, especially for scholars with small-and medium-N data sets. This research note explores two key assumptions in fsQCA's methodology for testing for necessary and sufficient conditions-the cumulation assumption and the triangular data assumption-and argues that, in combination, they produce a form of aggregation bias that has not been recognized in the fsQCA literature. It also offers a straightforward test to help researchers answer the question of whether their findings are plausibly the result of aggregation bias.

AB In its standard formulation, sequence analysis aims at finding typical patterns in a set of life courses represented as sequences. Recently, some proposals have been introduced to jointly analyze sequences defined on different domains (e.g., work career, partnership, and parental histories). We introduce measures to evaluate whether a set of domains are interrelated and their joint analysis justified. Also, we discuss about the quality of the results obtained using joint sequence analysis. In particular, we focus on cluster analysis and propose criteria to assess whether clusters obtained using a joint approach satisfactorily describe each domain.

AB Although social scientists devote considerable effort to mitigating measurement error during data collection, they often ignore the issue during data analysis. And although many statistical methods have been proposed for reducing measurement error-induced biases, few have been widely used because of implausible assumptions, high levels of model dependence, difficult computation, or inapplicability with multiple mismeasured variables. We develop an easy-to-use alternative without these problems; it generalizes the popular multiple imputation (MI) framework by treating missing data problems as a limiting special case of extreme measurement error and corrects for both. Like MI, the proposed framework is a simple two-step procedure, so that in the second step researchers can use whatever statistical method they would have if there had been no problem in the first place. We also offer empirical illustrations, open source software that implements all the methods described herein, and a companion article with technical details and extensions.

AB Despite recent and growing interest in using Twitter to examine human behavior and attitudes, there is still significant room for growth regarding the ability to leverage Twitter data for social science research. In particular, gleaning demographic information about Twitter usersa key component of much social science researchremains a challenge. This article develops an accurate and reliable data processing approach for social science researchers interested in using Twitter data to examine behaviors and attitudes, as well as the demographic characteristics of the populations expressing or engaging in them. Using information gathered from Twitter users who state an intention to not vote in the 2012 presidential election, we describe and evaluate a method for processing data to retrieve demographic information reported by users that is not encoded as text (e.g., details of images) and evaluate the reliability of these techniques. We end by assessing the challenges of this data collection strategy and discussing how large-scale social media data may benefit demographic researchers.

In our companion article, Blackwell, Honaker, and King give an intuitive overview of the new technique, along with practical suggestions and empirical applications. Here, we offer more precise technical details, more sophisticated measurement error model specifications and estimation procedures, and analyses to assess the approach's robustness to correlated measurement errors and to errors in categorical variables. These results support using the technique to reduce bias and increase efficiency in a wide variety of empirical research.

AB We address the task of determining, from statistical averages alone, whether a population under study consists of several subpopulations, unknown to the investigator, each responding to a given treatment markedly differently. We show that such determination is feasible in three cases: (1) randomized trials with binary treatments, (2) models where treatment effects can be identified by adjustment for covariates, and (3) models in which treatment effects can be identified by mediating instruments. In each of these cases, we provide an explicit condition which, if confirmed empirically, proves that treatment effect is not uniform but varies appreciably across individuals.

AB Contemporary case studies rely on verbal arguments and set theory to build or evaluate theoretical claims. While existing procedures excel in the use of qualitative information (information about kind), they ignore quantitative information (information about degree) at central points of the analysis. Effectively, contemporary case studies rely on crisp sets. In this article, I make the case for fuzzy-set case studies. I argue that the mechanisms that are the focal points of contemporary case study methods can be modeled as set-theoretic causal structures. I show how case study claims translate into sufficiency statements. And I show how these statements can be evaluated using fuzzy-set tools. This procedure permits the use of both qualitative and quantitative information throughout a case study. As a consequence, the analysis can determine whether one or more cases are both qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with its claims. Or whether some or all cases are consistent by kind but not by degree.

AB This study evaluated three types of biastotal, measurement, and selection bias (SB)in three sequential mixed-mode designs of the Dutch Crime Victimization Survey: telephone, mail, and web, where nonrespondents were followed up face-to-face (F2F). In the absence of true scores, all biases were estimated as mode effects against two different types of benchmarks. In the single-mode benchmark (SMB), effects were evaluated against a F2F reference survey. In an alternative analysis, a hybrid-mode benchmark (HMB) was used, where effects were evaluated against a mix of the measurements of a web survey and the SB of a F2F survey. A special reinterview design made available additional auxiliary data exploited in estimation for a range of survey variables. Depending on the SMB and HMB perspectives, a telephone, mail, or web design with a F2F follow-up (SMB) or a design involving only mail and/or web but not a F2F follow-up (HMB) is recommended based on the empirical findings.

AB To measure what determines people's attitudes, definitions, or decisions, surveys increasingly ask respondents to judge vignettes. A vignette typically describes a hypothetical situation or object as having various attributes (dimensions). In factorial surveys, the values (levels) of dimensions are experimentally varied, so that their impact on respondents' judgments can be estimated. Drawing on the literature in cognitive psychology and survey methodology, we examine two research questions: Does the order in which dimensions are presented impact the vignette evaluations and change substantive conclusions? Under which conditions are order effects mostly likely to occur? Using data from a web survey of 300 students, we analyze several possible moderators: features of the vignette design, characteristics of respondents, and interactions between these features. Results show that strong order effects can occur, but only when the vignettes are of a minimum complexity or respondents show a low attitude certainty.

AB That rates of normative behaviors produced by sample surveys are higher than actual behavior warrants is well evidenced in the research literature. Less well understood is the source of this error. Twenty-five cognitive interviews were conducted to probe responses to a set of common, conventional survey questions about one such normative behavior: religious service attendance. Answers to the survey questions and cognitive probes are compared both quantitatively and qualitatively. Half of the respondents amended their answer during cognitive probing, all amendments indicating a lower rate of attendance than originally reported, yielding a statistically significant reduction in reported attendance. Narrative responses shed light onto the source of bias, as respondents pragmatically interpreted the survey question to allow themselves to include other types of religious behavior, to report on a more religious past, and discount current constraints on their religious behavior, in order to report aspirational or normative religious identities.

AB The growing use of scales in survey questionnaires warrants the need to address how does polytomous differential item functioning (DIF) affect observed scale score comparisons. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of DIF on the type I error and effect size of the independent samples t-test on the observed total scale scores. A simulation study was conducted, focusing on potential variables related to DIF in polytomous items, such as DIF pattern, sample size, magnitude, and percentage of DIF items. The results showed that DIF patterns and the number of DIF items affected the type I error rates and effect size of t-test values. The results highlighted the need to analyze DIF before making comparative group interpretations.

TI Copula Models for Sociology: Measures of Dependence and Probabilities
   for Joint Distributions

ID BIVARIATE; FAMILY; REGRESSION; INFERENCE; SELECTION
AB Often in sociology, researchers are confronted with nonnormal variables whose joint distribution they wish to explore. Yet, assumptions of common measures of dependence can fail or estimating such dependence is computationally intensive. This article presents the copula method for modeling the joint distribution of two random variables, including descriptions of the method, the most common copula distributions, and the nonparametric measures of association derived from the models. Copula models, which are estimated by standard maximum likelihood techniques, make no assumption about the form of the marginal distributions, allowing consideration of a variety of models and distributions in the margins and various shapes for the joint distribution. The modeling procedure is demonstrated via a simulated example of spousal mortality and empirical examples of (1) the association between unemployment and suicide rates with time series models and (2) the dependence between a count variable (days drinking alcohol) and a skewed, continuous variable (grade point average) while controlling for predictors of each using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997. Other uses for copulas in sociology are also described.

AB This article deals with a model for describing a sequence of events, for example, education is typically attained by a set of transitions from one level of education to the next. In particular, this article tries to reconcile measures describing the effect of a variable on each of these transitions, with measures describing the effect of this variable on the final outcome of that process. Such a relationship has been known to exist within a sequential logit model, but it has hardly been used in empirical research mainly because of an absence of a practical way of giving it a substantive interpretation. This article tries to provide such an interpretation by showing that the effect on the final outcome is a weighted sum of the effects on each transition, such that a transition gets more weight if more people are at risk of passing that transition, passing the transition is more differentiating, and people gain more from passing.

AB Although much has been written about the process of party system institutionalization in different regions, the reasons why some party systems institutionalize while others do not still remain a mystery. Seeking to fill this lacuna in the literature, and using a mixed-methods research approach, this article constitutes a first attempt to answer simultaneously the following three questions: (1) What specific factors help party systems to institutionalize (or not)? (2) What are the links (in terms of time and degree) as well as the causal mechanisms behind such relationships? and (3) how do they affect a particular party system? In order to do so, this article focuses on the study of party system development and institutionalization in 13 postcommunist democracies between 1990 and 2010. Methodologically, the article innovates in five respects. First, it continues the debate on the importance of mixed methods when trying to answer different research questions. Second, it adds to the as yet brief literature on the combination of process tracing and qualitative comparative analysis. Third, it constitutes the first attempt to date to use a most similar different outcome/most different same outcome procedure in order to reduce causal complexity before undertaking a crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis. Third, it also shows the merits of combining both congruence and process tracing in the same comparative study. Finally, it also develops a novel bipolar comparative method to explain the extent to which opposite outcomes are determined by reverse conditions and conflicting intervening causal forces.

AB Recently, sociologists have expended much effort in attempts to define social mechanisms. We intervene in these debates by proposing that sociologists in fact have a choice to make between three standards of what constitutes a good mechanistic explanation: substantial, formal, and metaphorical mechanistic explanation. All three standards are active in the field, and we suggest that a more complete theory of mechanistic explanation in sociology must parse these three approaches to draw out the implicit evaluative criteria appropriate to each. Doing so will reveal quite different preferences for explanatory scope and nuance hidden under the ubiquitous term social mechanism. Finally, moving beyond extensive debates about realism and antirealism, we argue prescriptively against mechanistic fundamentalism for sociology and advocate for a more pluralistic understanding of social causality.

AB The combined usage of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) and process tracing (PT) in set-theoretic multi-method research (MMR) holds great potential for reaching valid inferences. Established views of case selection after QCA hold that studying negative cases provides lessons about the causes of an outcome in a limited set of circumstances. In particular, recommendations focus on negative cases only if they contradict the analysis or if suitably similar positive match cases exist to leverage comparisons. By contrast, I argue that set-theoretic MMR can gain from studying negative cases even when these conditions do not hold. First, negative cases can give insights into why an outcome fails to occur. Second, they can help guard against theoretical inconsistency between explanations for the outcome and its absence. Third, they can ensure that the mechanisms producing the outcome and its absence are not too similar to be logically capable of resulting in different outcomes. Following these arguments, I recommend that studies of negative cases in set-theoretic MMR focus on failure mechanisms in carefully bounded populations, search for theoretical inconsistency among mechanisms, and focus in part on the mechanism proposed to produce the outcome.

In this article, we consider a model where interest is simultaneously in two correlated response variables and one is potentially subject to misclassification. A motivating example of a recent study of the impact of a sexual education course for adolescents is considered. A simulation-based sample size determination scheme is applied to illustrate the impact of misclassification on power and bias for the parameters of interest.

AB Latent curve models have become a popular approach to the analysis of longitudinal data. At the individual level, the model expresses an individual's response as a linear combination of what are called basis functions that are common to all members of a population and weights that may vary among individuals. This article uses differential calculus to define the basis functions of a latent curve model. This provides a meaningful interpretation of the unique and dynamic impact of each basis function on the individual-level response. Examples are provided to illustrate this sensitivity, as well as the sensitivity of the basis functions, to changes in the measure of time.

AB This article introduces a number of methods that can be useful for examining the emergence of large-scale structures in collaboration networks. The study contributes to sociological research by investigating how clusters of research collaborators evolve and sometimes percolate in a collaboration network. Typically, we find that in our networks, one cluster among the leading ones eventually wins the growth race by percolating through the network, spanning it and rapidly filling up a significant volume of it. We show how this process is governed by the dynamics of cluster growth in the network. When operating in a percolating regime, this class of networks possesses many useful functional properties, which have important sociological implications. We first develop the methodological tools to perform a study of the intrinsic clustering process. Then, to understand the actual large-scale structure formation process in the network, we apply the theoretical methods to simulate a number of realistic scenarios, including one based on actual data on the collaboration behavior of a sample of researchers. From the perspective of social science research, our methods can be adapted to suit the application domains of many other types of real social processes.

AB Large-scale surveys typically exhibit data structures characterized by rich mutual dependencies between surveyed variables and individual-specific skip patterns. Despite high efforts in fieldwork and questionnaire design, missing values inevitably occur. One approach for handling missing values is to provide multiply imputed data sets, thus enhancing the analytical potential of the surveyed data. To preserve possible nonlinear relationships among variables and incorporate skip patterns that make the full conditional distributions individual specific, we adapt a full conditional multiple imputation approach based on sequential classification and regression trees. Individual-specific skip patterns and constraints are handled within imputation in a way ensuring the consistency of the sequence of full conditional distributions. The suggested approach is illustrated in the context of income imputation in the adult cohort of the National Educational Panel Study.

AB This study proposes using Internet search data from search engines like Google to produce state-level metrics that are useful in social science research. Generally, state-level research relies on demographic statistics, official statistics produced by government agencies, or aggregated survey data. However, each of these data sources has serious limitations in terms of both the availability of the data and its ability to capture important concepts. This study demonstrates how state-level Google search measures can be produced and then demonstrates the effectiveness of such measures in an empirical case: predicting state-level Tea Party movement mobilization. Drawing on existing studies of the Tea Party movement and theories of right-wing and conservative mobilization, state-level Google search measures for anti-immigrant sentiment and economic distress are developed and compared to traditional metrics that are typically used to measure these concepts, such as the unemployment rate and the international immigration rate in their ability to successfully predict Tea Party event counts. The results show that the Google search measures are effective in predicting Tea Party mobilization in a way that is consistent with existing theory, while the traditional measures are not.

AB For many years, sociologists, political scientists, and management scholars have readily relied on Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) for the purpose of configurational causal modeling. However, this article reveals that a severe problem in the application of QCA has gone unnoticed so far: model ambiguities. These arise when multiple causal models fare equally well in accounting for configurational data. Mainly due to the uncritical import of an algorithm that is unsuitable for causal modeling, researchers have typically been unaware of the whole model space. As a result, there exists an indeterminable risk for practically all QCA studies published in the last quarter century to have presented findings that their data did not warrant. Using hypothetical data, we first identify the algorithmic source of ambiguities and discuss to what extent they affect different methodological aspects of QCA. By reanalyzing a published QCA study from rural sociology, we then show that model ambiguities are not a mere theoretical possibility but a reality in applied research, which can assume such extreme proportions that no causal conclusions whatsoever are possible. Finally, the prevalence of model ambiguities is examined by performing a comprehensive analysis of 192 truth tables across 28 QCA studies published in applied sociology. In conclusion, we urge that future QCA practice ensures full transparency with respect to model ambiguities, both by informing readers of QCA-based research about their extent and by employing algorithms capable of revealing them.

AB Despite the increasing spread of standardized assessments of student learning, longitudinal data on achievement data are still lacking in many countries. This article raises the following question: Can we exploit cross-sectional assessments held at different schooling stages to evaluate how achievement inequalities related to individual-ascribed characteristics develop over time? This is a highly policy relevant issue, as achievement inequalities may develop in substantially different ways across educational systems. We discuss the issues involved in estimating dynamic models from repeated cross-sectional surveys in this context; consistently with a simple learning accumulation model, we propose an imputed regression strategy that allows to link two surveys and deliver consistent estimates of the parameters of interest. We then apply the method to Italian achievement data of fifth and sixth graders and investigate how inequalities develop between primary and lower secondary school.

ID QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; EUROPE; QCA
AB Explanatory typologies have recently experienced a renaissance as a research strategy for constructing and assessing causal explanations. However, both the new methodological works on explanatory typologies and the way such typologies have been used in practice have been affected by two shortcomings. First, no elaborate procedures for assessing the general explanatory power of a typological theory on the cross-case level have been devised. Second, rigorous selection procedures for within-case analysis are lacking. Against this background, we introduce a systematic measure that helps researchers assess the explanatory power on the cross-case level, first, within the scope set by a particular typological theory and, second, by investigating the transferability of the theory beyond these scope conditions via an increase in the number of cases. Drawing on recent methodological works on nested analysis, we show how researchers can identify key cases for process tracing based on the cross-case explanatory fit of the typological theory. We illustrate the purchase of our procedures by revisiting seminal studies from the field of comparative historical analysis.

AB Many randomized experiments in the social sciences allocate subjects to treatment arms at the time the subjects enroll. Desirable features of the mechanism used to assign subjects to treatment arms are often (1) equal numbers of subjects in intervention and control arms, (2) balanced allocation for population subgroups and across covariates, (3) ease of use, and (4) inability for a site worker to predict the treatment arm for a subject before he or she has been assigned. In general, a trade-off must be made among these features: Many mechanisms that achieve high balance do so at the cost of high predictability. In this article, we review methods for randomized assignment of individuals that have been discussed in the literature, evaluating the performance of each with respect to the desirable design features. We propose a method for controlling the amount of predictability in a study while achieving high balance across subgroups and covariates. The method is applicable when a database containing the subgroup membership and covariates of each potential participant is available in advance. We use simple simulation and graphical methods to evaluate the balance and predictability of randomization mechanisms when planning the study and describe a computer program implemented in the R statistical software package that prospectively evaluates candidate randomization methods.

AB In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the combination of two methods on the basis of set theory. In our introduction and this special issue, we focus on two variants of cross-case set-theoretic methodsqualitative comparative analysis (QCA) and typological theory (TT)and their combination with process tracing (PT). Our goal is to broaden and deepen set-theoretic empirical research and equip scholars with guidance on how to implement it in multimethod research (MMR). At first glance, set-theoretic cross-case methods and PT seem to be highly compatible when causal relationships are conceptualized in terms of set theory. However, multiple issues have not so far been thoroughly addressed. Our article builds on the emerging MMR literature and seeks to enhance it in four ways. First, we offer a comprehensive and coherent elaboration of the two sequences in which case studies can be combined with a cross-case method. Second, we expand the perspective and discuss QCA and TT as two alternative methods for the cross-case analysis. Third, based on the idea of analytical priority, we introduce the distinction between a condition-centered and a mechanism-centered variant of set-theoretic MMR. Fourth, we point attention to the challenges of theorizing and analyzing arrangements of conditions and mechanisms associated with sufficient conjunctions.

AB The combination of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) with process tracing, which we call set-theoretic multimethod research (MMR), is steadily becoming more popular in empirical research. Despite the fact that both methods have an elected affinity based on set theory, it is not obvious how a within-case method operating in a single case and a cross-case method operating on a population of cases are compatible and can be combined in empirical research. There is a need to reflect on whether and how set-theoretic MMR is internally coherent and how QCA and process tracing can be integrated in causal analysis. We develop a unifying foundation for causal analysis in set-theoretic MMR that highlights the roles and interplay of QCA and process tracing. We argue that causal inference via counterfactuals on the level of single cases integrates QCA and process tracing and assigns proper and equally valuable roles to both methods.

AB This article explores the practical challenges one faces when combining qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) and process tracing (PT) in a manner that is consistent with their underlying assumptions about the nature of causal relationships. While PT builds on a mechanism-based understanding of causation, QCA as a comparative method makes claims about counterfactual causal relationships. Given the need to ensure alignment between the ontological understandings of causation that underlie a method and methodological practice, the different ontological foundations result in methodological guidelines that contradict each other, forcing the analyst to choose whether to be more in alignment with one or the other method. This article explores the implications of contrasting guidelines in a practical case study, where a QCA for sufficiency is followed by two PT case studies of positive cases.

AB It is widely recognized that segregation processes are often the result of complex nonlinear dynamics. Empirical analyses of complex dynamics are however rare, because there is a lack of appropriate empirical modeling techniques that are capable of capturing complex patterns and nonlinearities. At the same time, we know that many social phenomena display nonlinearities. In this article, we introduce a new modeling tool in order to partly fill this void in the literature. Using data of all secondary schools in Stockholm county during the years 1990 to 2002, we demonstrate how the methodology can be applied to identify complex dynamic patterns like tipping points and multiple phase transitions with respect to segregation. We establish critical thresholds in schools' ethnic compositions, in general, and in relation to various factors such as school quality and parents' income, at which the schools are likely to tip and become increasingly segregated.

AB Social scientists routinely address temporal dependence by adopting a simple technical fix. However, the correct identification strategy for a causal effect depends on causal assumptions. These need to be explicated and justified; almost no studies do so. This article addresses this shortcoming by offering a precise general statement of the (nonparametric) causal assumptions required to identify causal effects under temporal dependence. In particular, this article clarifies when one should condition or not condition on lagged dependent variables (LDVs) to identify causal effects: one should not condition on LDVs, if there is no reverse causation and no outcome autocausation; one should condition on LDVs if there are no unobserved common causes of treatment and the lagged outcome, or no unobserved persistent causes of the outcome. When only one of these is true (with one exception), the incorrect decision will induce bias. Absent a well-justified identification strategy, inferences should be appropriately qualified.

AB Adjacent category logit models are ordered regression models that focus on comparisons of adjacent categories. These models are particularly useful for ordinal response variables with categories that are of substantive interest. In this article, we consider unconstrained and constrained versions of the partial adjacent category logit model, which is an extension of the traditional model that relaxes the proportional odds assumption for a subset of independent variables. In the unconstrained partial model, the variables without proportional odds have coefficients that freely vary across cutpoint equations, whereas in the constrained partial model two or more of these variables have coefficients that vary by common factors. We improve upon an earlier formulation of the constrained partial adjacent category model by introducing a new estimation method and conceptual justification for the model. Additionally, we discuss the connections between partial adjacent category models and other models within the adjacent approach, including stereotype logit and multinomial logit. We show that the constrained and unconstrained partial models differ only in terms of the number of dimensions required to describe the effects of variables with nonproportional odds. Finally, we illustrate the partial adjacent category logit models with empirical examples using data from the international social survey program and the general social survey.

AB Survey data are usually of mixed type (quantitative, multistate categorical, and/or binary variables). Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is one of the most extended methodologies to visualize the profile structure of the data. Since the past 60s, MDS methods have been introduced in the literature, initially in publications in the psychometrics area. Nevertheless, sensitivity and robustness of MDS configurations have been topics scarcely addressed in the specialized literature. In this work, we are interested in the construction of robust profiles for mixed-type data using a proper MDS configuration. To this end, we propose to compare different MDS configurations (coming from different metrics) through a combination of sensitivity and robust analysis. In particular, as an alternative to classical Gower's metric, we propose a robust joint metric combining different distance matrices, avoiding redundant information, via related metric scaling. The search for robustness and identification of outliers is done through a distance-based procedure related to geometric variability notions. In this sense, we propose a statistic for detecting multivariate outliers in the context of mixed-type data and evaluate its performance through a simulation study. Finally, we apply these techniques to a real data set provided by the largest humanitarian organization involved in social programs in Spain, where we are able to find in a robust way the most relevant factors defining the profiles of people that were under risk of being socially excluded in the beginning of the 2008 economic crisis.

AB Surveys provide a critical source of data for scholars, yet declining response rates are threatening the quality of data being collected. This threat is particularly acute among organizational studies that use key informantsthe mean response rate for published studies is 34 percent. This article describes several response enhancing strategies and explains how they were implemented in a national study of organizations that achieved a 94 percent response rate. Data from this study are used to examine the relationship between survey response patterns and nonresponse bias by conducting nonresponse analyses on several important individual and organizational characteristics. The analyses indicate that nonresponse bias is associated with the mean/proportion and variance of these variables and their correlations with relevant organizational outcomes. After identifying the variables most susceptible to nonresponse bias, a final analysis calculates the minimum response rate those variables needed to ensure that they do not contain significant nonresponse bias. Heuristic versions of these analyses can be used by survey researchers during data collection (and by scholars retrospectively) to assess the representativeness of respondents and the degree of nonresponse bias variables contain. This study has implications for survey researchers, scholars who analyze survey data, and those who review their research.

AB We offer a new conceptualization and measurement models for constructs at the group-level of analysis in small group research. The conceptualization starts with classical notions of group behavior proposed by Tonnies, Simmel, and Weber and then draws upon plural subject theory by philosophers Gilbert and Tuomela to frame a new perspective applicable to many forms of small group behavior. In the proposed measurement model, a collective property is operationalized as shared interpersonal action that explicitly allows us to control for systematic (method) error and random error. Group members act as key informants of group properties and processes and are treated as methods in a multitrait multimethod setting to validate our models. The models are applied to data of 277 three-person groups to develop and illustrate new procedures for ascertaining variation in measures due to hypothesized construct(s), method error, and random error. Implications and guidelines for small group research are discussed.

AB Background: Reliability of nonprobability online volunteer panels for epidemiological purposes has rarely been studied.
   Objectives: To assess the quality of a questionnaire on sexual and reproductive health (SRH) administered in a nonprobability Web panel and in a random telephone survey (n = 8,992; n = 8,437, age 16-49 years). Especially, we were interested in the possible difference in the association of sociodemographic variables and some outcome variables in the two surveys that are in the reliability of analytical epidemiological studies conducted in such panels.
   Methods: Interventions to increase response rate were used in both surveys (four e-mail reminders, high number of call attempts and callbacks to refusals). Both were calibrated on the census population. Sociodemographic composition, effects of reminders, and prevalence were compared to their telephone counterpart. In addition, the associations of sociodemographic and sexual behaviors were compared in the two samples in multivariate logistic regressions.
   Results: The online survey had a lower response rate (20.0 percent vs. 44.8 percent) and a more distorted sociodemographic structure although the reminders improved the representativeness as did the analogous interventions on the telephone survey. Prevalences of SRH variables were similar for the common behaviors but higher online for the stigmatized behaviors, depending on gender. Overall, 29 percent of the 63 interactions studied were significant for males and 11 percent for women, although opposite effects of sociodemographic variables were rare (5 percent of the 171 tested for each gender).
   Conclusion: Nonprobability online panels are to be used with caution to monitor SRH and conduct analytical epidemiological studies, especially among men.

AB Since the 1970s, catalogs of protest events have been at the heart of research on social movements. To measure how protest changes over time or varies across space, sociologists usually count the frequency of events, as either the dependent variable or a key independent variable. An alternative is to count the number of participants in protest. This article investigates demonstrations, strikes, and riots. Their size distributions manifest enormous variation. Most events are small, but a few large events contribute the majority of protesters. When events are aggregated by year or by city, the correlation between total participation and event frequency is low or modest. The choice of how to quantify protest is therefore vital; findings from one measure are unlikely to apply to another. The fact that the bulk of participation comes from large events has positive implications for the compilation of event catalogs. Rather than worrying about the underreporting of small events, concentrate on recording large ones accurately.

AB The National Study of Protest Events (NSPE) employed hypernetwork sampling to generate the first-ever nationally representative sample of protest events. Nearly complete information about various event characteristics was collected from participants in 1,037 unique protests across the United States in 2010 to 2011. The first part of this article reviews extant methodologies in protest-event research and discusses how the NSPE overcomes their recognized limitations. Next, we detail how the NSPE was conducted and present descriptive statistics for a number of important event characteristics. The hypernetwork sample is then compared to newspaper reports of protests. As expected, we find many differences in the types of events these sources capture. At the same time, the overall number and magnitude of the differences are likely to be surprising. By contrast, little variation is observed in how protesters and journalists described features of the same events. NSPE data have many potential applications in the field of contentious politics and social movements, and several possibilities for future research are outlined.

DE multilevel; sampling; survey; weights; structural modeling
ID INFERENCE
AB This research empirically evaluates data sets from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) for design effects of ignoring the sampling design in weighted two-level analyses. Currently, researchers may ignore the sampling design beyond the levels that they model which might result in incorrect inferences regarding hypotheses due to biased standard error estimates; the degree of bias depends on the informativeness of any ignored stratification and clustering in the sampling design. Some multilevel software packages accommodate first-stage sampling design information for two-level models but not all. For five example public release data sets from the NCES, design effects of ignoring the sampling design in unconditional and conditional two-level models are presented for 15 dependent variables selected based on a review of published research using these five data sets. Empirical findings suggest that there are minor effects of ignoring the additional sampling design and no differences in inference would be made had the first-stage sampling design been ignored. Strategically, researchers without access to multilevel software that can accommodate the sampling might consider including stratification variables as independent variables at level 2 of their model.

AB Mobile technologies, specifically smartphones, offer social scientists a potentially powerful approach to examine the social world. They enable researchers to collect information that was previously unobservable or difficult to measure, expanding the realm of empirical investigation. For research that concerns resource-poor and hard-to-reach groups, smartphones may be particularly advantageous by lessening sample selection and attrition and by improving measurement quality of irregular and unstable experiences. At the same time, smartphones are nascent social science tools, particularly with less advantaged populations that may have different phone usage patterns and privacy concerns. Using findings from a smartphone study of men recently released from prison, this article discusses the strengths and challenges of smartphones as data collection tools among disadvantaged and hard-to-reach groups.

AB The literature proposes numerous so-called pseudo-R-2 measures for evaluating goodness of fit in regression models with categorical dependent variables. Unlike ordinary least square-R-2, log-likelihood-based pseudo-R(2)s do not represent the proportion of explained variance but rather the improvement in model likelihood over a null model. The multitude of available pseudo-R-2 measures and the absence of benchmarks often lead to confusing interpretations and unclear reporting. Drawing on a meta-analysis of 274 published logistic regression models as well as simulated data, this study investigates fundamental differences of distinct pseudo-R-2 measures, focusing on their dependence on basic study design characteristics. Results indicate that almost all pseudo-R(2)s are influenced to some extent by sample size, number of predictor variables, and number of categories of the dependent variable and its distribution asymmetry. Hence, an interpretation by goodness-of-fit benchmark values must explicitly consider these characteristics. The authors derive a set of goodness-of-fit benchmark values with respect to ranges of sample size and distribution of observations for this measure. This study raises awareness of fundamental differences in characteristics of pseudo-R(2)s and the need for greater precision in reporting these measures.

AB Between-subject design surveys are a powerful means of gauging public opinion, but critics rightly charge that closed-ended questions only provide slices of insight into issues that are considerably more complex. Qualitative research enables richer accounts but inevitably includes coder bias and subjective interpretations. To mitigate these issues, we have developed a sequential mixed-methods approach in which content analysis is quantitized and then compared in a contrastive fashion to provide data that capitalize upon the features of qualitative research while reducing the impact of coder bias in analysis of the data. This article describes the method and demonstrates the advantages of the technique by providing an example of insights into public attitudes that have not been revealed using other methods.

AB This article explores the ontological politics of research in the field of community studies. Focusing on a migrant community in London, UK, it shows how the community is (re)assembled in different ways through the different research practices of academics and practitioners. Guided by a framework based on material semiotics, this article compares the agendas, methods, and representational texts that inform the different research practices. It argues that community studies researchers have an ethical responsibility to acknowledge the particular enactments of communities that emerge through their research and the role that agendas, methods, and texts play in constructing those enactments.

AB Many poverty measures are estimated by using sample data collected from social surveys. Two examples are the poverty gap and the poverty severity indices. A novel method for the estimation of these poverty indicators is described. Social surveys usually contain different variables, some of which can be used to improve the estimation of poverty measures. The proposed estimation methodology is based on this idea. The variance estimation and the construction of confidence intervals are also topics addressed in this article. Real survey data, extracted from the European Union Survey on Income and Living Conditions and based on various countries, are used to investigate some empirical properties of our estimators via Monte Carlo simulation studies. Empirical results indicate that the suggested methods can be more accurate than the customary estimator. Desirable results are also obtained for the proposed variances and confidence intervals. Various populations generated from the Gamma distribution also support our findings.

AB Data collected in psychological studies are mainly characterized by containing a large number of variables (multidimensional data sets). Analyzing multidimensional data can be a difficult task, especially if only classical approaches are used (hypothesis tests, analyses of variance, linear models, etc.). Regarding multidimensional models, visual techniques play an important role because they can show the relationships among variables in a data set. Parallel coordinates and Chernoff faces are good examples of this. This article presents self-organizing maps (SOM), a multivariate visual data mining technique used to provide global visualizations of all the data. This technique is presented as a tutorial with the aim of showing its capabilities, how it works, and how to interpret its results. Specifically, SOM analysis has been applied to analyze the data collected in a study on the efficacy of a cognitive and behavioral treatment (CBT) for childhood obesity. The objective of the CBT was to modify the eating habits and level of physical activity in a sample of children with overweight and obesity. Children were randomized into two treatment conditions: CBT traditional procedure (face-to-face sessions) and CBT supported by a web platform. In order to analyze their progress in the acquisition of healthier habits, self-register techniques were used to record dietary behavior and physical activity. In the traditional CBT condition, children completed the self-register using a paper-and-pencil procedure, while in the web platform condition, participants completed the self-register using an electronic personal digital assistant. Results showed the potential of SOM for analyzing the large amount of data necessary to study the acquisition of new habits in a childhood obesity treatment. Currently, the high prevalence of childhood obesity points to the need to develop strategies to manage a large number of data in order to design procedures adapted to personal characteristics and increase treatment efficacy.

AB The item wording (or keying) effect is respondents' differential response style to positively and negatively worded items. Despite decades of research, the nature of the effect is still unclear. This article proposes a potential reason; namely, that the item wording effect is scale-specific, and thus findings are applicable only to a particular measure involved in an investigation. Using multiple scales and several methods, the present study provides strong and converging support for this hypothesis. In light of the results, we reinterpret major findings of the item wording effect and propose possible future directions for research.

The alignment method considers the groups as a fixed mode of variation, while the random-intercept, random-loading two-level method considers the groups as a random mode of variation. Both maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses are applied. A survey of close to 50,000 subjects in 26 countries is used as an illustration. In addition, the two methods are studied by Monte Carlo simulations. A list of considerations for choosing between the two methods is presented.

AB Measurement invariance is a necessary precondition for meaningful cross-country comparisons, and three levels have been differentiated: configural, metric, and scalar. Unfortunately, establishing the most stringent form, that is, scalar measurement invariance, across groups is difficult. Recently, Muthen and Asparouhov proposed testing for approximate rather than exact measurement invariance, as this may be sufficient for meaningful comparisons. Following their strategy, the results of cross-country approximate measurement invariance tests of the 21-item Portrait Value Questionnaire (PVQ-21) scale to measure values in the European Social Survey are presented (N = 274,447 respondents from 15 countries participating in all six rounds). Applying the new approximate method for the test of measurement invariance allows both using more moderate constraints of approximate equality of parameters across groups and exploring the extent of noninvariance. Approximate measurement invariance was established in almost all rounds for two higher-order values: openness to change and self-enhancement. In the case of the two other higher-order values, self-transcendence and conservation, approximate measurement invariance was established across a subset of countries.

AB This study applies the alignment method, a technique for assessing measurement equivalence across many groups, to the analysis of adolescents' support for immigrants' rights in a pooled data set from the 1999 International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) Civic Education Study and the 2009 IEA International Civics and Citizenship Education Study. We examined measurement invariance across 92 groups (country by cohort by gender), finding that a five-item scale was statistically well-grounded for unbiased group comparisons despite the presence of significant noninvariance in some groups. Using the resulting group mean scores, we compared European youth's attitudes finding that female students had more positive attitudes than did male students across countries and cohorts. An analysis of countries participating in both studies revealed that students in most countries demonstrated more positive attitudes in 2009 than in 1999. The alignment methodology makes it feasible to comprehensively assess measurement invariance in large data sets and to compute aligned factor scores for the full sample that can update existing databases for more efficient further secondary analysis and with metainformation concerning measurement invariance.

AB It is necessary to test for equivalence of measurements across groups to guarantee that comparisons of regression coefficients or mean scores of a latent factor are meaningful. Unfortunately, when tested, many scales display nonequivalence. Several researchers have suggested that nonequivalence may be used as a useful source of information as to why equivalence is biased and proposed employing a multilevel structural equation modeling (MLSEM) approach to explain why equivalence is not given. This method can consider a latent between-level factor and/or single contextual variables and use them to explain items' nonequivalence. In the current study, we show that this method may also be useful for social science studies in general and for survey research and sociological comparative studies in particular when one fails to establish cross-group equivalence. We utilize data from the International Social Survey Program national identity module (2003) to test for the cross-country equivalence of a scale measuring attitudes toward granting citizenship rights to immigrants. As expected, the scale fails to achieve scalar equivalence. However, we explain a significant part of the most nonequivalent intercept by a latent between-level factor and one contextual variable, namely, the percentage of foreigners in the country relying on group threat theory. We show that the method does not necessarily rectify nonequivalence, but it can help to explain why it is absent.

AB This article distinguishes three measures of intergenerational economic mobility that emerge when the population is divided into groups: overall individual mobility, within-group mobility, and between-group mobility. We clarify their properties and the relationship between them. We then evaluate Clark's use of surname between-group persistence as a preferred measure of intergenerational mobility in the book The Son Also Rises: Surnames and the History of Social Mobility. We show that aggregate surname-level intergenerational persistence cannot be compared with individual persistence because group-level income averages captures diverse individual-level and group-level factors impossible to disentangle without additional identifying information. Furthermore, measures of group persistence do not address the problem of measurement error leading to attenuation bias, which is Clark's rationale to study surname mobility. An empirical example partitioning the population into groups based on racial/ethnic origins and a simulation clarify the relationship between these different measures of mobility.

AB Development and refinement of self-report measures generally involves selecting a subset of indicators from a larger set. Despite the importance of this task, methods applied to accomplish this are often idiosyncratic and ad hoc, or based on incomplete statistical criteria. We describe a structural equation modeling (SEM)-based technique, based on the standardized residual variance-covariance matrix, which subsumes multiple traditional psychometric criteria: item homogeneity, reliability, convergent, and discriminant validity. SEMs with a fixed structure, but with substituted candidate items, can be used to evaluate the relative performance of those items. Using simulated data sets, we demonstrate a simple progressive elimination algorithm, which demonstrably optimizes item choice across multiple psychometric criteria. This method is then applied to the task of short-form development of the multidimensional 4Es (Excitement, Esteem, Escape, Excess) scale, which are understood as indicators of psychological vulnerability to gambling problems. It is concluded that the proposed SEM-based algorithm provides an automatic and efficient approach to the item-reduction stage of scale development and should be similarly useful for the development of short forms of preexisting scales. Broader use of such an algorithm would promote more transparent, consistent, and replicable scale development.

ID NESTED ANALYSIS; PITFALLS; STRATEGY
AB The last decade has witnessed resurgence in the interest in studying the causal mechanisms linking causes and effects. This article games through the methodological consequences that adopting a systems understanding of mechanisms has for what types of cases we should select when using in-depth case study methods like process tracing. The article proceeds in three steps. We first expose the assumptions that underpin the study of causal mechanisms as systems that have methodological implications for case selection. In particular, we take as our point of departure the case-based position, where: causation is viewed in deterministic and asymmetric terms, the focus is ensuring causal homogeneity in case-based research to enable cross-case inferences to be made, and finally where mechanisms are understood as more than just intervening variables but instead a system of interacting parts that transfers causal forces from causes to outcomes. We then develop a set of case selection guidelines that are in methodological alignment with these underlying assumptions. We then develop guidelines for research where the mechanism is the primary focus, contending that only typical cases where both X, Y, and the requisite contextual conditions are present should be selected. We compare our guidelines with the existing, finding that practices like selecting most/least-likely cases are not compatible with the underlying assumptions of tracing mechanisms. We then present guidelines for deviant cases, focusing on tracing mechanisms until they breakdown as a tool to shed light on omitted contextual and/or causal conditions.

AB Analyzing relationships of necessity is important for both scholarly and applied research questions in the social sciences. An often-used technique for identifying such relationshipsfuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA)has limited ability to make the most out of the data used. The set-theoretical technique fsQCA makes statements in kind (e.g., a condition or configuration is necessary or not for an outcome), thereby ignoring the variation in degree. We propose to apply a recently developed technique for identifying relationships of necessity that can make both statements in kind and in degree, thus making full use of variation in the data: Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA). With its ability to also make statements in degree (a specific level of a condition is necessary or not for a specific level of the outcome), NCA can complement the in kind analysis of necessity with fsQCA.

AB The article outlines a methodology for systematically observing collective violence (and public order policing in relation to it). Specific attention is given to matters of sampling and measurement and to the way in which observational challenges have been met in comparison with participant observational studies of demonstrations and football matches. The article shows that it is possible to conduct meaningful systematic observations of episodes of collective violence in a reliable way (more complete and more detailed than police records or newspaper reports) without compromising the physical safety of the observer. Even though violence at these types of events is relatively rare, it is also possible specifically to sample events with an increased likelihood for collective violence. Direct systematic observation of collective violence yields data that cannot be obtained by other means (surveys, interviews, participant observation) and that are crucial to an understanding of the initiation and escalation of collective violence.

AB Respondent-driven sampling (RDS), a link-tracing sampling and inference method for studying hard-to-reach populations, has been shown to produce asymptotically unbiased population estimates when its assumptions are satisfied. However, some of the assumptions are prohibitively difficult to reach in the field, and the violation of a crucial assumption can produce biased estimates. We compare two different inference approaches: design-based inference, which relies on the known probability of selection in sampling, and model-based inference, which is based on models of human recruitment behavior and the social context within which sampling is conducted. The advantage of the latter approach is that when the violation of an assumption has been shown to produce biased population estimates, the model can be adjusted to more accurately reflect actual recruitment behavior, and thereby control for the source of bias. To illustrate this process, we focus on three sources of bias, differential effectiveness of recruitment, a form of nonresponse bias, and bias resulting from status differentials that produce asymmetries in recruitment behavior. We first present diagnostics for identifying types of bias and then present new forms of a model-based RDS estimator that controls for each type of bias. In this way, we show the unique advantages of a model-based estimator.

AB In this article, a numerical method integrated with statistical data simulation technique is introduced to solve a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations with multiple random variable coefficients. The utilization of Monte Carlo simulation with central divided difference formula of finite difference (FD) method is repeated n times to simulate values of the variable coefficients as random sampling instead being limited as real values with respect to time. The mean of the n final solutions via this integrated technique, named in short as mean Monte Carlo finite difference (MMCFD) method, represents the final solution of the system. This method is proposed for the first time to calculate the numerical solution obtained for each subpopulation as a vector distribution. The numerical outputs are tabulated, graphed, and compared with previous statistical estimations for 2013, 2015, and 2030, respectively. The solutions of FD and MMCFD are found to be in good agreement with small standard deviation of the means, and small measure of difference. The new MMCFD method is useful to predict intervals of random distributions for the numerical solutions of this epidemiology model with better approximation and agreement between existing statistical estimations and FD numerical solutions.

AB Survey research is still confronted by a trend of increasing nonresponse rates. In this context, several methodological advances have been made to stimulate participation and avoid bias. Yet, despite the growing number of tools and methods to deal with nonresponse, little is known about whether nonresponse biases show similar trends as nonresponse rates and what mechanisms (if any) drive changes in bias. Our article focuses on biases in cohort distributions in the U.S. and German general social surveys from 1980 to 2012 as one of the key variables in the social sciences. To supplement our cross-national comparison of these trends, we decompose changes into within-cohort change (WCC) and between-cohort change. We find that biases in cohort distributions have remained relatively stable and at a relatively low level in both countries. Furthermore, WCC (i.e., survey climate) accounts for the major part of the change in nonresponse bias.

AB This study investigates the impact of different modes and tailor-made response enhancing measures (TMREM)-such as bilingual interviewers with a shared ethnic background and translated questionnaires-on the measurement of substantive variables in surveys among minority ethnic groups in the Netherlands. It also provides insight into the ability to detect mode measurement effects of a recently developed method for disentangling mode measurement and mode selection effects, as well as into the tenability of the assumptions underlying this method. The data used in this study come from a large-scale survey design experiment among the four largest non-Western minority ethnic groups in the Netherlands comparing single-mode computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) and sequential computer-assisted web interviewing, computer-assisted telephone interviewing, and CAPI-MM. The number and intensity of the TMREM varied among the four ethnic groups. The results show that mode measurement effects occur among all ethnic groups and are the result of a combination of the presence or absence of an interviewer and TMREM. Mode measurement effects occur more often on sociocultural questions, but also, on occasion, on more sociostructural or background questions. The method used to disentangle mode measurement and mode selection effects can be applied to detect mode measurement effects, but one should be cautious in interpreting them. Implausible mode measurement effects can be caused by the violation of the assumptions underlying this method.

AB Information quality deficiencies have been detected in occupational safety and health surveys in Europe, which typically gather self-reported data responded by employers or their representatives. For instance, their low response rates and informant profiles make estimations on establishments with safety representatives (SRs) unreliable. We tested the mode of administration and informants as sources of error regarding establishments with SRs in Catalonia, Spain. Two sources of information were compared: the Second Catalan Survey of Working Conditions 2011 (IICSWC)-with a methodology similar to surveys conducted at the state and European level-and the Progam on Prevention of Risks Management in Companies (PPRMC)-in which the labor authority collected data using a documentary verification in another sample of establishments. Percentage of establishments with SRs was estimated using the data from the PPRMC and also the differences in percentage between sources and informant profiles (with 95 percent confidence interval). Results show that the IICSWC overestimates the percentage of establishments with SRs.

ID P-ASTERISK MODELS; SOCIAL NETWORKS
AB Two approaches for the statistical analysis of social network generation are widely used; the tie-oriented exponential random graph model (ERGM) and the stochastic actor-oriented model (SAOM) or Siena model. While the choice for either model by empirical researchers often seems arbitrary, there are important differences between these models that current literature tends to miss. First, the ERGM is defined on the graph level, while the SAOM is defined on the transition level. This allows the SAOM to model asymmetric or one-sided tie transition dependence. Second, network statistics in the ERGM are defined globally but are nested in actors in the SAOM. Consequently, dependence assumptions in the SAOM are generally stronger than in the ERGM. Resulting from both, meso- and macro-level properties of networks that can be represented by either model differ substantively and analyzing the same network employing ERGMs and SAOMs can lead to distinct results. Guidelines for theoretically founded model choice are suggested.

AB Using randomly ordered name generators, we tested the effect of name generators' relative position on the likelihood of respondents' declining to respond or satisficing in their response. An online survey of public health staff elicited names of information sources, information seekers, perceived experts, and friends. Results show that when name generators are asked later, they are more likely to go unanswered and respondents are more likely to respond that they do not know anyone or list fewer names. The effect of sequence was not consistent in different question types, which could be the result of the moderating effect of willingness to answer and question sensitivity.

AB Item characteristics can have a significant effect on survey data quality and may be associated with measurement error. Literature on data quality and measurement error is often inconclusive. This could be because item characteristics used for detecting measurement error are not coded unambiguously. In our study, we use a systematic coding procedure with multiple coders to investigate the extent to which the coding of item characteristics could be done reliably. For this purpose, we constructed an item characteristics scheme that is based on typologies of characteristics. High intercoder reliability indicates a clear relation between item characteristic, item content, and measurement error. Our results show that intercoder reliability is often low, especially for item characteristics that are hard to code due to subjectivity. Low intercoder reliability complicates comparisons between studies about item characteristics and measurement error. We give suggestions for coping with low intercoder reliability.

ID ECOLOGICAL INFERENCE
AB Our objective is the estimation of voter transitions between two consecutive parliamentary elections. Usually, such analyses have been based either on individual survey data or on aggregated data. To move beyond these methods and their respective problems, we propose the application of so-called hybrid models, which combine aggregate and individual data. We use a Bayesian approach and extend a multinomial-Dirichlet model proposed in the ecological inference literature. Our new hybrid model has been implemented in the R-package eiwild (= Ecological Inference with individual-level data). Based on extensive simulations, we are able to show that our new estimator exhibits a very good estimation performance in many realistic scenarios. Application case is the voter transition between the Bavarian Regional election and the German federal elections 2013 in the Metropolitan City of Munich. Our approach is also applicable to other areas of electoral research, market research, and epidemiology.

ID MODEL UNCERTAINTY; GROWTH EMPIRICS; SELECTION
AB Young and Holsteen (YH) introduce a number of tools for evaluating model uncertainty. In so doing, they are careful to differentiate their method from existing forms of model averaging. The fundamental difference lies in the way in which the underlying estimates are weighted. Whereas standard approaches to model averaging assign higher weight to better fitting models, the YH method weights all models equally. As I show, this is a nontrivial distinction, in that the two sets of procedures tend to produce radically different results. Drawing on both simulation and real-world examples, I demonstrate that in failing to distinguish between numerical variation and statistical uncertainty, the procedure proposed by YH will tend to overstate the amount of uncertainty resulting from variation across models. In standard circumstances, the quality of estimates produced using this method will tend to be objectively worse than that of conventional alternatives.

AB The commenter's proposal may be a reasonable method for addressing uncertainty in predictive modeling, where the goal is to predict y. In a treatment effects framework, where the goal is causal inference by conditioning-on-observables, the commenter's proposal is deeply flawed. The proposal (1) ignores the definition of omitted-variable bias, thus systematically omitting critical kinds of controls; (2) assumes for convenience there are no bad controls in the model space, thus waving off the premise of model uncertainty; and (3) deletes virtually all alternative models to select a single model with the highest R-2. Rather than showing what model assumptions are necessary to support one's preferred results, this proposal favors biased parameter estimates and deletes alternative results before anyone has a chance to see them. In a treatment effects framework, this is not model robustness analysis but simply biased model selection.

AB The social integration of a city depends on the extent to which people from different neighborhoods have the opportunity to interact with one another, but most prior work has not developed formal ways of conceptualizing and measuring this kind of connectedness. In this article, we develop original, network-based measures of what we call "structural connectedness" based on the everyday travel of people across neighborhoods. Our principal index captures the extent to which residents in each neighborhood of a city travel to all other neighborhoods in equal proportion. Our secondary index captures the extent to which travels within a city are concentrated in a handful of receiving neighborhoods. We illustrate the value of our indices for the 50 largest American cities based on hundreds of millions of geotagged tweets over 18 months. We uncover important features of major American cities, including the extent to which their connectedness depends on a few neighborhood hubs, and the fact that in several cities, contact between some neighborhoods is all but nonexistent. We also show that cities with greater population densities, more cosmopolitanism, and less racial segregation have higher levels of structural connectedness. Our indices can be applied to data at any spatial scale, and our measures pave the way for more powerful and precise analyses of structural connectedness and its effects across a broad array of social phenomena.

TI A Set-Theoretic Approach to Bayesian Process Tracing
SO SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Bayesian analysis; process tracing; set theory; possible worlds;
   hypothesis testing
AB This article develops a set-theoretic approach to Bayes's theorem and Bayesian process tracing. In the approach, hypothesis testing is the procedure whereby one updates beliefs by narrowing the range of states of the world that are regarded as possible, thus diminishing the domain in which the actual world can reside. By explicitly connecting Bayesian analysis to its set-theoretic foundations, the approach makes process tracing more intuitive and thus easier to apply for qualitative researchers. Moreover, the set-theoretic approach provides new tools for assessing both the consequentialness and expectedness of evidence when conducting process tracing. It also provides a new way to classify and interpret process-tracing tests, such as hoop tests and smoking gun tests, by viewing them as zones in a continuous space whose dimensions reflect the magnitude of changes in sets. The article shows that Bayesian process tracing and set-theoretic process tracing are not alternatives to each other but rather two sides of the same coin.

AB In face-to-face surveys, interviewer observations are a cost-effective source of paradata for nonresponse adjustment of survey estimates and responsive survey designs. Unfortunately, recent studies have suggested that the accuracy of these observations can vary substantially among interviewers, even after controlling for household-, area-, and interviewer-level characteristics, limiting their utility. No study has identified sources of this unexplained variance in observation accuracy. Motivated by theoretical expectations from the observer bias literature, this study analyzed more than 45,000 open-ended justifications provided by interviewers in the U.S. National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) for their observations on two key features of all sampled NSFG households: presence of children and expected probability of household response. The study finds that variability among interviewers in the cues used to record these observations (evident from the open-ended justifications) explains much of the previously unexplained variance in observation accuracy.

AB This article makes the case for shadowing as ethnographic methodology: focusing attention on what occurs as interlocutors move among settings and situations. Whereas ethnographers often zoom in on one principal set of situations or site, we argue that intersituational variation broadens and deepens the researcher's ethnographic account as well as affording important correctives to some common inferential pitfalls. We provide four warrants for shadowing: (a) buttressing intersituational claims, (b) deepening ethnographers' ability to trace meaning making by showing how meanings shift as they travel and how such shifts may affect interlocutors' understandings, (c) gaining leverage on the structure of subjects' social worlds, and (d) helping the ethnographer make larger causal arguments. We show the use value of these considerations through an analysis of violence and informal networks in an ethnography of immigrant Latinos who met to socialize and play soccer in a Los Angeles park.

AB Using Canadian data from 1976 to 2014, I study the size distribution of strikes with three alternative measures of strike size: the number of workers on strike, strike duration in calendar days, and the number of person calendar days lost to a strike. I use a maximum likelihood framework that provides a way to estimate distributions, evaluate model fit, and also test against alternative distributions. I consider a few theories that can create power law distributions in strike size, such as the joint costs model that posits strike size is inversely proportional to dispute costs. I find that the power law distribution fits the data for the number of lost person calendar days relatively well and is also more appropriate than the lognormal distribution. I also discuss the implications of my findings from a methodological, research, and policy perspective.

ID MODEL
AB The potential of social media to give insight into the dynamic evolution of public conversations, and into their reactive and constitutive role in political activities, has to date been underdeveloped. While topic modeling can give static insight into the structure of a conversation, and keyword volume tracking can show how engagement with a specific idea varies over time, there is need for a method of analysis able to understand how conversations about societal values evolve and react to events in the world by incorporating new ideas and relating them to existing themes. In this article, we propose a method for analyzing social media messages that formalizes the structure of public conversations and allows the sociologist to study the evolution of public discourse in a rigorous, replicable, and data-driven fashion. This approach may be useful to those studying the social construction of meaning, the origins of factionalism and internecine conflict, or boundary-setting and group-identification exercises and has potential implications.

AB Recently, both sociology of science and policy research have shown increased interest in scientific uncertainty. To contribute to these debates and create an empirical measure of scientific uncertainty, we inductively devised two systems of classification or ontologies to describe scientific uncertainty in a large corpus of food safety risk assessments with the help of machine learning (ML). We ask three questions: (1) Can we use ML to assist with coding complex documents such as food safety risk assessments on a difficult topic like scientific uncertainty? (2) Can we assess using ML the quality of the ontologies we devised? (3) And, finally, does the quality of our ontologies depend on social factors? We found that ML can do surprisingly well in its simplest form identifying complex meanings, and it does not benefit from adding certain types of complexity to the analysis. Our ML experiments show that in one ontology which is a simple typology, against expectations, semantic opposites attract each other and support the taxonomic structure of the other. And finally, we found some evidence that institutional factors do influence how well our taxonomy of uncertainty performs, but its ability to capture meaning does not vary greatly across the time, institutional context, and cultures we investigated.

AB Currently available (classical) testing procedures for the network autocorrelation can only be used for falsifying a precise null hypothesis of no network effect. Classical methods can be neither used for quantifying evidence for the null nor for testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously. This article presents flexible Bayes factor testing procedures that do not have these limitations. We propose Bayes factors based on an empirical and a uniform prior for the network effect, respectively, first. Next, we develop a fractional Bayes factor where a default prior is automatically constructed. Simulation results suggest that the first two Bayes factors show superior performance and are the Bayes factors we recommend. We apply the recommended Bayes factors to three data sets from the literature and compare the results to those coming from classical analyses using p values. R code for efficient computation of the Bayes factors is provided.

AB Although a wealth of literature exists studying the effect of sponsor characteristics on self-reports of mental health, little work assesses a related but potentially powerful effect: a context comprehension effect, that is, a change in the respondent's interpretation of a survey question, given the concept elicited by the interviewer. Further, most studies of sponsor effects assess mean differences in responses according to sponsor type; no work has studied how these effects can affect the reliability of a psychometric instrument, which are of general importance to sociological studies of health. Here, using a study of 169 recently discharged hospital patients, we find that both effects are likely to have affected responses and, together, negated the reliability of a psychometric instrument. Future studies should consider the effect of not only sponsor characteristics upon responses but also consider how questions might be interpreted given in an interview context.

AB A rapidly growing number of algorithms are available to researchers who apply statistical or machine learning methods to answer social science research questions. The unique advantages and limitations of each algorithm are relatively well known, but it is not possible to know in advance which algorithm is best suited for the particular research question and the data set at hand. Typically, researchers end up choosing, in a largely arbitrary fashion, one or a handful of algorithms. In this article, we present the Super Learner-a powerful new approach to statistical learning that leverages a variety of data-adaptive methods, such as random forests and spline regression, and systematically chooses the one, or a weighted combination of many, that produces the best forecasts. We illustrate the use of the Super Learner by predicting violence among inmates from the 2005 Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional Facilities. Over the past 40 years, mass incarceration has drastically weakened prisons' capacities to ensure inmate safety, yet we know little about the characteristics of prisons related to inmate victimization. We discuss the value of the Super Learner in social science research and the implications of our findings for understanding prison violence.

AB The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition (BOD) is a popular method for studying the contributions of explanatory factors to social inequality. The results have often been given causal interpretations. While recent work and this article both show that some types of BOD are equivalent to a counterfactual-based treatment effect/selection bias decomposition, this equivalence does not hold in general. Given this lack of general equivalence, in this article based on the counterfactual framework, we propose a method of treatment effect deviation (TED) to study social inequality. Essentially, the TED assesses to what extent the omission of particular covariates (i.e., selection bias in the omitted variables) can alter the estimated treatment effect. The TED has a better causal interpretation and can be estimated nonparametrically (and hence is more robust to model misspecification errors). Therefore, the TED may serve as an alternative to or may be used in tandem with the BOD. We illustrate the new method through two case studies. In the first case study, we show that the TED provides a more credible estimate of the treatment effect on the treated than does the BOD. However, both the TED and the BOD highlight the importance of accounting for prior earning in estimating the training effect. In the second case study, the results of the two methods differ notably, but both agree that normative factors play a significant role in generating the rural-urban disparity in social policy preference in China.

AB Causal inference under treatment interference is a challenging but important problem. Past studies usually make strong assumptions on the structure of treatment interference in order to estimate causal treatment effects while accounting for the effect of treatment interference. In this article, we view treatment diffusion as a concrete form of treatment interference that is prevalent in social settings and also as an outcome of central interest. Specifically, we analyze data from a smoking prevention intervention conducted with 4,094 students in six middle schools in China. We measure treatment interference by tracing how the distributed intervention brochures are shared by students, which provides information to construct the so-called treatment diffusion networks. Besides providing descriptive analyses, we use exponential random graph models to model the treatment diffusion networks in order to reveal covariates and network processes that significantly correlate with treatment diffusion. We show that the findings provide an empirical basis to evaluate previous assumptions on the structure of treatment interference, are informative for imputing treatment diffusion data that is crucial for making causal inference under treatment interference, and shed light on how to improve designs of future interventions that aim to optimize treatment diffusion.

AB We explore the relations between the notion of distance and a feature set-based concept of similarity and show that this concept of similarity has a spatial interpretation that is complementary to distance: it is interpreted as "direction." Furthermore, we show how proper normalization leads to distances that can be directly interpreted as dissimilarity: Closeness in normalized space implies and is implied by similarity of the same objects, while remoteness implies and is implied by dissimilarity. Finally, we show how, in research into destandardization of the life course, properly normalizing may drastically and unequivocally change our interpretation of intercohortal distances.

This is done by using optional randomized response technique in stratified sampling using a combination of Mangat and Singh, Mangat, and Greenberg et al. models. The suggested model has been studied assuming proportional and Neyman allocation schemes. Numerical results show larger gains in efficiency. Through a detailed numerical study, it is established that the suggested model is relatively more efficient than the Kim and Warde model and the models mentioned above.

AB After nearly four decades of growth, the number of people held in U.S. prisons has begun to decline. In an era of decarceration, social scientists need to understand prisoner reentry experiences. Longitudinal studies are one strategy to accomplish this goal. Yet, the retention of a formerly incarcerated population across waves of interviews is challenging due to their transient lifestyles and limited support systems, which may be further complicated by gang involvement. This article details the longitudinal follow-up procedures used in the LoneStar Project-a multiwave study of 802 males first interviewed in prison and reinterviewed twice in the year postrelease-to build rapport, complete interviews, and minimize attrition. We then evaluate the effectiveness of our procedures on important outcomes including interview yields, appointments, and incoming calls. Results indicate that any outgoing contact with respondents via appointment reminders and other reciprocal modes of contact lead to greater project engagement and a greater likelihood of interview completion. We conclude with relevant takeaways for researchers seeking to maximize survey participation with hard-to-reach populations.

AB Most studies of the early origins of adult health rely on summing dichotomously measured negative exposures to measure childhood misfortune (CM), neglect, adversity, or trauma. There are several limitations to this approach, including that it assumes each exposure carries the same level of risk for a particular outcome. Further, it often leads researchers to dichotomize continuous measures for the sake of creating an additive variable from similar indicators. We propose an alternative approach within the structural equation modeling (SEM) framework that allows differential weighting of the negative exposures and can incorporate dichotomous and continuous observed variables as well as latent variables. Using the Health and Retirement Study data, our analyses compare the traditional approach (i.e., adding indicators) with alternative models and assess their prognostic validity on adult depressive symptoms. Results reveal that parameter estimates using the conventional model likely underestimate the effects of CM on adult health outcomes. Additionally, while the conventional approach inhibits testing for mediation, our model enables testing mediation of both individual CM variables and the cumulative variable. Further, we test whether cumulative CM is moderated by the accumulation of protective factors, which facilitates theoretical advances in life course and social inequality research. The approach presented here is one way to examine the cumulative effects of early exposures while attending to diversity in the types of exposures experienced. Using the SEM framework, this versatile approach could be used to model the accumulation of risk or reward in many other areas of sociology and the social sciences beyond health.

ID INCOME INEQUALITY
AB In common sociological research, income inequality is measured only at the aggregate level. The main purpose of this article is to demonstrate that there is more than meets the eye when inequality is indicated by a single measure. In this article, I introduce an alternative method that evaluates individuals' contributions to inequality as well as the between-group and within-group components of these individual contributions. I first highlight three common inequality measures, the Gini index and two generalized entropy measures-Theil's T and Theil's L indices-by presenting their individual components as a method for evaluating inequality. Five artificial data examples illustrate the use of these individual components first. An empirical analysis of the 2007 and 2017 Current Population Survey data then focuses on the differences in inequality revealed by such individual inequality components between the 2007 and 2017. The individual-level inequality measures can reveal patterns of inequality concealed by single measures at the aggregate level. In particular, the Gini individual measures differentiate cases better than the generalized entropy measures and tend to have smaller standard errors in a regression analysis.

AB Conventional advice discourages controlling for postoutcome variables in regression analysis. By contrast, we show that controlling for commonly available postoutcome (i.e., future) values of the treatment variable can help detect, reduce, and even remove omitted variable bias (unobserved confounding). The premise is that the same unobserved confounder that affects treatment also affects the future value of the treatment. Future treatments thus proxy for the unmeasured confounder, and researchers can exploit these proxy measures productively. We establish several new results: Regarding a commonly assumed data-generating process involving future treatments, we (1) introduce a simple new approach and show that it strictly reduces bias, (2) elaborate on existing approaches and show that they can increase bias, (3) assess the relative merits of alternative approaches, and (4) analyze true state dependence and selection as key challenges. (5) Importantly, we also introduce a new nonparametric test that uses future treatments to detect hidden bias even when future-treatment estimation fails to reduce bias. We illustrate these results empirically with an analysis of the effect of parental income on children's educational attainment.

AB In the last 60 years, the proportion of white Americans expressing anti-black prejudice in face-to-face survey interviews has declined dramatically. To test whether social desirability pressures affect the expression of anti-black prejudice, we analyzed a within-subjects experiment in the 2008 American National Election Study in which white respondents first reported their endorsement of stereotypes of blacks confidentially via audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI) and weeks or months later orally during second interviews. Shifting to ACASI led to a small but significant increase in negative views of blacks. Unexpectedly, shifting to ACASI also led to a similarly large increase in negative views of whites. Furthermore, the ACASI reports had no more predictive validity than did the oral reports. This evidence suggests that social desirability pressures do not seriously compromise oral reports of racial stereotypes in face-to-face interviews.

AB Ethnography is made of relationships. Even when the observations the ethnographer writes of take place between others in the field, it is through the development of relationships that data are generated and through a particular relationship that interpretation is offered. In this introduction to the special issue about relationships and theorizing in ethnography, I outline three relevant dimensions of such relationships that aren't captured by current debates that center on power dynamics in the field: (a) Alignment. Going beyond the trifecta of race, class, and gender, I suggest that a key element of positionality includes the ways in which the ethnographer's projects align (or purposely fail to align) with those of her interlocutors; (b) Temporality. Thinking seriously about time allows us to appreciate how differences in the temporal arcs of research modulate the narrative arcs of theory as well as set the stage for the afterlife of participant observation in the process of writing and publishing; and (c) Place. As relationships deepen, ethnographers often find themselves in new spaces, complementing the temporality of narrative arcs with a different landscape of social theory. Doing so, this article calls for renewed attention to the way in which the patterned structure of relationships in the field shapes how ethnographers theorize their work.

AB This article examines the practices of ethnographers carrying out research in and, especially, on organizations. Ethnographers studying organizations, like other ethnographers, emphasize close observation and understanding the meaning of actions, words, and artifacts; they differ from other fieldworkers, though, in focusing on the organization itself, not just what happens inside it. Because fieldwork relationships are the core technology of organizational ethnography, this article argues, the challenges of studying organizations differ from the challenges of doing ethnography in other settings or with other analytic purposes precisely because the character of the organization and its activities shape what the researcher can and will study. This article discusses how fieldwork relationships are constrained and shaped as ethnographers submit their projects for ethics review, gain access to research sites, hang out in the organizations they are studying, interview informants, study organizational documents and paperwork, and handle requests to give back to the site.

TI The Ethical Dilemmas and Social Scientific Trade-offs of Masking in

ID STREET
AB Masking, the practice of hiding or distorting identifying information about people, places, and organizations, is usually considered a requisite feature of ethnographic research and writing. This is justified both as an ethical obligation to one's subjects and as a scientifically neutral position (as readers are enjoined to treat a case's idiosyncrasies as sociologically insignificant). We question both justifications, highlighting potential ethical dilemmas and obstacles to constructing cumulative social science that can arise through masking. Regarding ethics, we show, on the one hand, how masking may give subjects a false sense of security because it implies a promise of confidentiality that it often cannot guarantee and, on the other hand, how naming may sometimes be what subjects want and expect. Regarding scientific tradeoffs, we argue that masking can reify ethnographic authority, exaggerate the universality of the case (e.g., "Middletown"), and inhibit replicability (or "revisits") and sociological comparison. While some degree of masking is ethically and practically warranted in many cases and the value of disclosure varies across ethnographies, we conclude that masking should no longer be the default option that ethnographers unquestioningly choose.

ID STRANGER; CULTURE; POVERTY; STREET
AB Much contemporary ethnography hopes to engage with a community to justify social critique. Whether from problem selection, interpersonal rewards, or a desire for exchange, researchers often take the "side" of informants. Such an approach, linked to "public ethnography," marginalizes a once-traditional approach to fieldwork, that of the ethnographic stranger. I present a model of scholarly detachment and questioning of group interests. Drawing on my own experiences and those of members of the Second Chicago School, I argue for an approach in which an unaffiliated observer questions community interests, arguing that skepticism of local explanations can discover processes shared by other scenes and can develop transsituational concepts. While the ethnographer can be seduced into sharing a group's perspective, observational distancing can mitigate this. In an approach I label skeptical ethnography, the ethnographic stranger avoids partisan allegiance in the field and at the desk. Skepticism of local interests must be combined with an epistemic generosity that recognizes that all action, whether seemingly righteous or repellent, responds to an interaction order.

LA English
DT Article
DE ethnography; professions; venues; tethers; medicine
AB Ethnographers often study those who periodically meet to interact in multiple venues. This article focuses on how people who share and engage in tasks in recurrently visited venues define and change their social projects' problems and solutions. To address the complexities of this "meta-work," I introduce the concept of "tethers." Tethers are links across venues that people use to set and shift these problems and solutions that are continuously being contested. Drawing on examples from the author's fieldwork and other ethnographic accounts of professional work, I examine three types of tethers: focal participants, things, and language. Paying attention to tethers also results in practical implications for managing subjects' use of the ethnographer as a tether, making decisions about what venues to observe, and developing strategies for focusing one's observations when in those venues. I argue that a focus on subjects' use of tethers across venues helps mitigate the challenges ethnographers face when accounting for the influence of temporally and geographically distant sites of recurrent interaction.

AB Radical social movements are broadly engaged in, and dedicated to, promoting change in their social environment. In their corresponding efforts to call attention to various causes, communicate with like-minded groups, and mobilize support for their activities, radical social movements also produce an enormous amount of text. These texts, like radical social movements themselves, are often (i) densely connected and (ii) highly variable in advocated protest activities. Given a corpus of radical social movement texts, can one uncover the underlying network structure of the radical activist groups involved in this movement? If so, can one then also identify which groups (and which subnetworks) are more prone to radical versus mainstream protest activities? Using a large corpus of British radical environmentalist texts (1992-2003), we seek to answer these questions through a novel integration of network discovery and unsupervised topic modeling. In doing so, we apply classic network descriptives (e.g., centrality measures) and more modern statistical models (e.g., exponential random graph models) to carefully parse apart these questions. Our findings provide a number of revealing insights into the networks and nature of radical environmentalists and their texts.

AB Knowledge questions frequently are used in survey research to measure respondents' topic-related cognitive ability and memory. However, in self-administered surveys, respondents can search external sources for additional information to answer a knowledge question correctly. In this case, the knowledge question measures accessible and procedural memory. Depending on what the knowledge question aims at, the validity of this measure is limited. Thus, in this study, we conducted three experiments using a web survey to investigate the effects of task difficulty, respondents' ability, and respondents' motivation on the likelihood of searching external sources for additional information as a form of over-optimizing response behavior when answering knowledge questions. We found that the respondents who are highly educated and more interested in a survey are more likely to invest additional efforts to answer knowledge questions correctly. Most importantly, our data showed that for these respondents, a more difficult question design further increases the likelihood of over-optimizing response behavior.

AB In this article, we examine whether cross-national studies disclose enough information for independent researchers to evaluate the validity and reliability of the findings (evaluation transparency) or to perform a direct replication (replicability transparency). The first contribution is theoretical. We develop a heuristic theoretical model including the actors, factors, and processes that influence the transparency of cross-national studies and provide an overview of the measures currently taken to improve research transparency. The second contribution is empirical, in which we analyze the level of transparency in published cross-national studies. Specifically, using a random sample of 305 comparative studies published in one of 29 peer-reviewed social sciences journals (from 1986 to 2016), we show that, even though all the articles include some methodological information, the great majority lack sufficient information for evaluation and replication. Lastly, we develop and propose a set of transparency guidelines tailored for reporting cross-national survey research.

AB Recent debates about qualitative methods have discussed the relative limitations and contributions of interviews in comparison to surveys and participant observation. These discussions have rarely considered how ethnographers themselves use interviews as part of their work. We suggest that Lizardo's discussion of three modes of culture (declarative, nondeclarative, and public) help us to understand the separate contributions of observation and interviews, with ethnographic interviews an especially helpful means of accessing different cultural modes. We also argue that Lizardo's conception of public culture should be divided into meso- and macrolevels and that this division helps to show the differing contributions of interviews within and without an ethnographic context. Developing our argument with data from the second author's ethnographic research and analysis of other scholars' ethnographies, we show how research that uses ethnographic interviews can help sociologists better understand how these four cultural modes interact.

ID GROWTH
AB Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is an influential methodological approach motivated by set theory and boolean logic. QCA proponents have developed algorithms to analyze quantitative data, in a bid to uncover necessary and sufficient conditions where causal relationships are complex, conditional, or asymmetric. This article uses computer simulations to show that researchers in the QCA tradition face a vexing double bind. On the one hand, QCA algorithms often require large data sets in order to recover an accurate causal model, even if that model is relatively simple. On the other hand, as data sets increase in size, it becomes harder to guarantee data integrity, and QCA algorithms can be highly sensitive to measurement error, data entry mistakes, or misclassification.

In this context, particularly the disambiguation (who is referred to in a text?) and specification (which demographic characteristics are present?) of social actors-currently a manual job-remains a challenge. This article demonstrates a reliable and accurate software architecture for social scientists who are interested in automatically detecting, disambiguating, and demographically specifying social actors (i.e., persons and organizations) in large text collections. The backbone of our software architecture is the online encyclopedia Wikipedia as a currently unexploited data source of a large amount of accurately prepared information. We illustrate how our software architecture detects and disambiguates social actors in large text corpora and retrieves their respective demographic information. Overall, we evaluate the reliability and accuracy of our software architecture across seven different social settings and facilitate an intuitive sense of the comprehensive applicability of our software architecture. We end by not only highlighting the benefits of our software architecture for social science research but also pointing to the limitations of using Wikipedia as a data source.

AB The article explores the role that subjective evidence of causality and associated counterfactuals and counterpotentials might play in the social sciences where comparative cases are scarce. This scarcity rules out statistical inference based upon frequencies and usually invites in-depth ethnographic studies. Thus, if causality is to be preserved in such situations, a conception of ethnographic causal inference is required. Ethnographic causality inverts the standard statistical concept of causal explanation in observational studies, whereby comparison and generalization, across a sample of cases, are both necessary prerequisites for any causal inference. Ethnographic causality allows, in contrast, for causal explanation prior to any subsequent comparison or generalization.

ID MINIMIZATION
AB Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) is a relatively young method of causal inference that continues to diffuse across the social sciences. However, recent methodological research has found the conservative (QCA-CS) and the intermediate solution type (QCA-IS) of QCA to fail fundamental tests of correctness. Even under conditions otherwise ideal for causal discovery, both solution types frequently committed causal fallacies by presenting inferences that were in direct disagreement with the underlying data-generating structure to be discovered by QCA. None of these problems affected the parsimonious solution type (QCA-PS). These findings conflict with conventional wisdom in the QCA literature, which has it that QCA-CS uses empirical information only and that QCA-IS is preferable to both QCA-CS and QCA-PS. The present article resolves these contradictions. It shows that QCA-CS and QCA-IS systematically supplement empirical data with matching artificial data. These artificial data, however, regularly induce causal fallacies of severe magnitude. Researchers who employ QCA-CS or QCA-IS in empirical analyses thus always risk moving further away from the truth rather than closer to it.

AB Does X affect Y? Answering this question is particularly difficult if reverse causality is looming. Many social scientists turn to panel data to address such questions of causal ordering. Yet even in longitudinal analyses, reverse causality threatens causal inference based on conventional panel models. Whereas the methodological literature has suggested various alternative solutions, these approaches face many criticisms, chief among them to be sensitive to the correct specification of temporal lags. Applied researchers are thus left with little guidance. Seeking to provide such guidance, we compare how different panel models perform under a range of different conditions. Our Monte Carlo simulations reveal that unlike conventional panel models, a cross-lagged panel model with fixed effects not only offers protection against bias arising from reverse causality under a wide range of conditions but also helps to circumvent the problem of misspecified temporal lags.

AB In this article, we explore the use of Facebook targeted advertisements for the collection of survey data. We illustrate the potential of survey sampling and recruitment on Facebook through the example of building a large employee-employer linked data set as part of The Shift Project. We describe the workflow process of targeting, creating, and purchasing survey recruitment advertisements on Facebook. We address concerns about sample selectivity and apply poststratification weighting techniques to adjust for differences between our sample and that of "gold standard" data sources. We then compare univariate and multivariate relationships in the Shift data against the Current Population Survey and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997. Finally, we provide an example of the utility of the firm-level nature of the data by showing how firm-level gender composition is related to wages. We conclude by discussing some important remaining limitations of the Facebook approach, as well as highlighting some unique strengths of the Facebook targeted advertisement approach, including the ability for rapid data collection in response to research opportunities, rich and flexible sample targeting capabilities, and low cost, and we suggest broader applications of this technique.

AB The main objective of the qualitative comparative analysis is to find solutions that display sufficient configurations of causal conditions leading to the presence of an outcome. These solutions should be less complex than the original observed configurations, as parsimonious as possible, without sacrificing the sufficiency requirement. Sufficiency and parsimony are two requirements that act in opposition, and an optimal solution is one that accommodates both. There are different search strategies that lead to different types of solutions, with an ongoing debate about which solution type is closest to the true, underlying causal structure. This article presents the different logics behind each simplification system in order to explain how and why they lead to different results and introduces the concept of "robust sufficiency" to clear the debate. It analyses the correctness ratios for the different solution type and provides an improved set of procedures to measure correctness that captures the best features from each system. Out of the competition between the conservative and the parsimonious search strategies, the intermediate solution emerges as the best hybrid that is suitable for causal analysis, outperforming the parsimonious solution in recovering a known (even parsimonious) causal structure.

AB Meta-analysis is a statistical method that combines quantitative findings from previous studies. It has been increasingly used to obtain more credible results in a wide range of scientific fields. Combining the results of relevant studies allows researchers to leverage study similarities while modeling potential sources of between-study heterogeneity. This article provides a review of the core methodologies of meta-analysis that we consider most relevant to sociological research. After developing the foundation of the fixed- and random-effects models of meta-analysis models, this article illustrates the utility of the method with regression coefficients reported from two sets of social science studies. We explain the various steps of the process including constructing the meta-sample from primary studies, estimating the fixed- and random-effects models, analyzing the source of heterogeneity across studies, and assessing publication bias. We conclude with a discussion of steps that could be taken to strengthen the development of meta-analysis in sociological research, which will eventually increase the credibility of sociological inquiry via a knowledge-cumulative process.

Building on the traditional frequentist framework, we introduce a method of Bayesian assessment of null values to provide an alternative way to examine the parallel lines assumption using highest density intervals and regions of practical equivalence. Second, we propose a new hyperparameter cumulative logit model that can improve upon existing ones in addressing several challenges where traditional modeling techniques fail. We use two empirical examples from health research to showcase the Bayesian approaches.

AB Spatial regression models provide the opportunity to analyze spatial data and spatial processes. Yet, several model specifications can be used, all assuming different types of spatial dependence. This study summarizes the most commonly used spatial regression models and offers a comparison of their performance by using Monte Carlo experiments. In contrast to previous simulations, this study evaluates the bias of the impacts rather than the regression coefficients and additionally provides results for situations with a nonspatial omitted variable bias. Results reveal that the most commonly used spatial autoregressive and spatial error specifications yield severe drawbacks. In contrast, spatial Durbin specifications (SDM and SDEM) and the simple spatial lag of X (SLX) provide accurate estimates of direct impacts even in the case of misspecification. Regarding the indirect "spillover" effects, several-quite realistic-situations exist in which the SLX outperforms the more complex SDM and SDEM specifications.

AB Multilevel models are increasingly used in sociology and other social sciences to analyze variation of tie outcomes in egocentrically sampled network data, particularly in studies of social support. Existing research assumes that the personal networks in the data do not overlap (i.e., they do not have actors in common), which makes standard hierarchical models suitable for analysis. This assumption is unrealistic in certain sampling designs, including the case of egos sampled from higher level groups or via link-tracing methods. We describe different types of ego-network overlap and propose a method to detect overlapping actors and analyze the resulting data with cross-classified multilevel models. The method is demonstrated with an application to research on personal networks and social support among Hispanic immigrants in rural U.S. destinations. Overlap detection and modeling result in better model fit, more correct partition of tie variation among different sources, and the ability to test new substantive hypotheses.

ID BAYES FACTORS; HYPOTHESES
AB The Schwarz or Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is one of the most widely used tools for model comparison in social science research. The BIC, however, is not suitable for evaluating models with order constraints on the parameters of interest. This article explores two extensions of the BIC for evaluating order-constrained models, one where a truncated unit information prior is used under the order-constrained model and the other where a truncated local unit information prior is used. The first prior is centered on the maximum likelihood estimate, and the latter prior is centered on a null value. Several analyses show that the order-constrained BIC based on the local unit information prior works better as an Occam's razor for evaluating order-constrained models and results in lower error probabilities. The methodology based on the local unit information prior is implemented in the R package "BICpack" which allows researchers to easily apply the method for order-constrained model selection. The usefulness of the methodology is illustrated using data from the European Values Study.

AB Causal analyses typically focus on average treatment effects. Yet for substantive research on topics like inequality, interest extends to treatments' distributional consequences. When individuals differ in their responses to treatment, three types of inequality may result. Treatment may shape inequalities between subgroups defined by pretreatment covariates, it may induce more inequality in one subgroup than another, or it may polarize people across multiple dimensions of well-being. We introduce a model, called a covariance regression, that captures all three types of inequality via the means, variances, and correlations between multiple outcomes. The model can test for heterogeneous treatment effects, quantify the heterogeneity, and explain its structure using covariates. Finding that a treatment creates inequalities could drive theoretical refinement and inform policy decisions (targeting groups where payoffs will be most predictable). We illustrate the utility of covariance regressions by analyzing the effects of sharing information about income inequality on redistributive preferences.

AB While conflict event data sets are increasingly used in contemporary conflict research, important concerns persist regarding the quality of the collected data. Such concerns are not necessarily new. Yet, because the methodological debate and evidence on potential errors remains scattered across different subdisciplines of social sciences, there is little consensus concerning proper reporting practices in codebooks, how best to deal with the different types of errors, and which types of errors should be prioritised. In this article, we introduce a new analytical framework-that is, the Total Event Error (TEE) framework-which aims to elucidate the methodological challenges and errors that may affect whether and how events are entered into conflict event data sets, drawing on different fields of study. Potential errors are diverse and may range from errors arising from the rationale of the media source (e.g., selection of certain types of events into the news) to errors occurring during the data collection process or the analysis phase. Based on the TEE framework, we propose a set of strategies to mitigate errors associated with the construction and use of conflict event data sets. We also identify a number of important avenues for future research concerning the methodology of creating conflict event data sets.

AB The ease at which online paradata can be captured in web surveys seems to increase social researchers' desire to collect such data. Yet little attention is paid to whether respondents actually approve of their collection. This article, therefore, studies online survey respondents' acceptance of automatically collecting their geographical locations. In wave 4 of the German Internet Panel, we asked respondents for their consent to automatically track their location using a JavaScript. Respondents were also asked to report their location in a set of traditional survey questions. About 62 percent of respondents consented to the automated collection of their location whereas 97 percent provided their location manually. With respect to consent biases, we find evidence that the composition of the achieved sample of geo-located respondents is biased and that the personal characteristics associated with respondents' willingness to be geo-located differ between the automated tracking and manual provision of geo-information.

AB In this article, we consider the use of the zero-truncated binomial distribution as a randomization device while estimating the population proportion of a sensitive characteristic. The resultant new estimator based on the zero-truncated binomial distribution is then compared to its competitors from both the efficiency and the protection point of views. The situations where the proposed new estimator performs better are reported. R codes are also included.

AB Measuring the existence and patterning of white flight (WF) using aggregate data has a long history in the social sciences. In this article, we assess past measurement approaches and identify several technical and conceptual limitations. To address these shortcomings, we propose a new multicomponent approach to detecting WF that requires tracts to exceed a minimum level of loss across four distinct dimensions of population change. Using both simulated and real data, we show that our approach provides stronger protection against common classification errors and behaves more consistently across a broad range of neighborhood types. We conclude with a substantive application that demonstrates the utility of our multicomponent approach to researchers who are interested in assessing the "buffering hypothesis." We find that our multicomponent approach detects higher levels of WF than recognized in previous studies, raising important questions about the formation and long-term stability of racially diverse neighborhoods in the United States.

AB This article presents an updated meta-analysis of survey experiments comparing the performance of the item count technique (ICT) and the direct questioning method. After synthesizing 246 effect sizes from 54 studies, we find that the probability that a sensitive item will be selected is .089 higher when using ICT compared to direct questioning. In recognition of the heterogeneity across studies, we seek to explain this variation by means of moderator analyses. We find that the relative effectiveness of ICT is moderated by cultural orientation in the context in which ICT is conducted (collectivism vs. individualism), the valence of topics involved in the applications (socially desirable vs. socially undesirable), and the number of nonkey items. In the Discussion section, we elaborate on the methodological implications of the main findings.
