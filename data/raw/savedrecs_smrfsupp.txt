AB It is common for social scientists to use formal quantitative methods to compare ecological units such as towns, schools, or nations. In many cases, the size of these units in terms of the number of individuals subsumed in each differs substantially. When the variables in question are counts, there is generally some attempt to neutralize differences in size by turning variables into ratios or by controlling for size. But methods that are appropriate in many demographic and epidemiological contexts have been used in settings where they may not be justified and may well introduce spurious relations between variables. We suggest local regressions as a simple diagnostic and generalized additive models as a superior modeling strategy, with double-residualized regressions as a backup for certain cases.

AB How much should ethnographers involve themselves with the people, places, and processes they study? One answer has become increasingly popular: invert the standard method of participant observation into observant participation. This article draws on an ethnography of ambulance work to consider the trade-offs between these approaches. My fieldwork included "ride-alongs" with labor and management at a private ambulance firm in California (participant observation) and short-term employment as a novice emergency medical technician at the same company (observant participation). Beyond a simplistic distinction in "empirical depth," I identify three issues at stake between participant observation and observant participation: field positioning, analytic gaze, and data assembly. Where participant observation presents more opportunities for mobile positioning, outward gazing, and inscription, observant participation presents more opportunities for fixed positioning, inward gazing, and incarnation. In addition to justifying such contrasts, I consider the advantages of mixing these styles into a hybrid approach when feasible.

AB Researchers increasingly take advantage of the comparative case design to build theory, but the degree of case dependence is occasionally discussed and theorized. We suggest that the comparative case study design might be subject to an often underappreciated threat-dependence across cases-under certain conditions. Using research on innovation diffusion as an illustration, we explore the role of social linkages across cases when building theory through comparison and contrast between cases. We develop an agent-based simulation, grounded by comparative case research about innovation diffusion, as novel way to study the implications of case dependence in theory building using multiple-case study research. Our simulation results suggest that the degree of case dependence has a nontrivial bearing on innovation diffusion experienced by case entities, specifically when the researcher draws a few case entities operating in a highly interconnected industry. Under these conditions, overlooking the degree of case dependence might weaken newly built theory against commonly held standards of internal validity and external validity in inductive research. We conceptualize the issue of case dependence as a concern about researchers' bounded rationality. Accordingly, we build on our findings to provide actionable advice aiming to alleviate this concern while being amendable to the variety of approaches to build theory from multiple cases in social sciences.

AB In mixed methods approaches, statistical models are used to identify "nested" cases for intensive, small-n investigation for a range of purposes, including notably the examination of causal mechanisms. This article shows that under a commonsense interpretation of causal effects, large-n models allow no reliable conclusions about effect sizes in individual cases-even if we choose "onlier" cases as is usually suggested. Contrary to established practice, we show that choosing "reinforcing" outlier cases-where outcomes are stronger than predicted in the statistical model-is appropriate for testing preexisting hypotheses on causal mechanisms, as this reduces the risk of false negatives. When investigating mechanisms inductively, researchers face a choice between "onlier" and reinforcing outlier cases that represents a trade-off between false negatives and false positives. We demonstrate that the inferential power of nested research designs can be much increased through paired comparisons of cases. More generally, this article provides a new conceptual framework for understanding the limits to and conditions for causal generalization from case studies.

AB With the growing availability of large-scale text-based data sets, there is an increasing need for an accessible and systematic way to analyze qualitative texts. This article introduces and details the contextual text coding (CTC) method as a mixed-methods approach to large-scale qualitative data analysis. The method is particularly useful for complex text, textual data characterized by context-specific meanings and a lack of consistent terminology. CTC provides an alternative to current approaches to analyzing large textual data sets, specifically computational text analysis and hand coding, neither of which capture both the qualitative and quantitative analytical potential of large-scale textual data sets. Building on hand coding techniques and systematic sampling methods, CTC provides a clear six-step process to produce both quantitative and qualitative analyses of large-scale complex textual data sources. This article includes two examples, using projects focusing on journal and interview data, respectively, to illustrate the method's versatility.

AB Transparency is once again a central issue of debate across types of qualitative research. Work on how to conduct qualitative data analysis, on the other hand, walks us through the step-by-step process on how to code and understand the data we've collected. Although there are a few exceptions, less focus is on transparency regarding decision-making processes in the course of research. In this article, we argue that scholars should create a living codebook, which is a set of tools that documents the data analysis process. It has four parts: (1) a processual database that keeps track of initial codes and a final database for completed codes, (2) a "definitions and key terms" list for conversations about codes, (3) memo-writing, and (4) a difference list explaining the rationale behind unmatched codes. It allows researchers to interrogate taken-for-granted assumptions about what data are focused on, why, and how to analyze it. To that end, the living codebook moves beyond discussions around intercoder reliability to how analytic codes are created, refined, and debated.

DT Article; Early Access
DE fuzzy logic; fuzzy sets; logical operators; prototype theory; family
   resemblance
AB This article aims to clarify fundamental aspects of the process of assigning fuzzy scores to conditions based on family resemblance (FR) structures by considering prototype and set theories. Prototype theory and set theory consider FR structures from two different angles. Specifically, set theory links the conceptualization of FR to the idea of sufficient and INUS (Insufficient but Necessary part of a condition, which is itself Unnecessary but Sufficient for the result) sets. In contrast, concept membership in prototype theory is strictly linked to the notion of similarity (or resemblance) in relation to the prototype, which is the anchor of the ideational content of the concept. After an introductive section where I elucidate set-theoretic and prototypical aspects of concept formation, I individuate the axiomatic properties that identify the principles of transforming FR structures into fuzzy sets. Finally, I propose an algorithm based on the power mean that is able to operationalize FR structures considering both set-theoretic and prototype theory perspectives.

AB How can we measure the resource mobilization (RM) efforts of social movements on Twitter? In this article, we create the first ever measure of social movements' RM efforts on a social media platform. To this aim, we create a four-conditional lexicon that can parse through tweets and identify those concerned with RM. We also create a simple RM score that can be plotted in a time series format to track the RM efforts of social movements in real time. We use our tools with millions of tweets from the United States streamed between November 28, 2018, and February 11, 2019, to demonstrate how our measure can help us estimate the saliency and persistency of social movements' RM efforts. We find that our measure captures RM by successfully cross checking the variation of this score against protest events in the United States during the same time frame. Finally, we illustrate the descriptive and qualitative utility of our tools for understanding social movements by running conventional topic modeling algorithms on the tweets that were used to compute the RM score and point at specific avenues for theory building and testing.

AB Spatial microsimulation encompasses a range of alternative methodological approaches for the small area estimation (SAE) of target population parameters from sample survey data down to target small areas in contexts where such data are desired but not otherwise available. Although widely used, an enduring limitation of spatial microsimulation SAE approaches is their current inability to deliver reliable measures of uncertainty-and hence confidence intervals-around the small area estimates produced. In this article, we overcome this key limitation via the development of a measure of uncertainty that takes into account both variance and bias, that is, the mean squared error. This new approach is evaluated via a simulation study and demonstrated in a practical application using European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions data to explore income levels across Italian municipalities. Evaluations show that the approach proposed delivers accurate estimates of uncertainty and is robust to nonnormal distributions. The approach provides a significant development to widely used spatial microsimulation SAE techniques.

DT Article; Early Access
DE segregation; occupational segregation; residential segregation; school
   segregation; decomposition
AB An important topic in the study of segregation are comparisons across space and time. This article extends current approaches in segregation measurement by presenting a five-term decomposition procedure that can be used to understand more clearly why segregation has changed or differs between two comparison points. Two of the five terms account for differences in segregation that are due to the differing marginal distributions (e.g., the gender and occupational distributions), while one term accounts for differences in segregation due the different structure of segregation (what might be termed "pure" segregation). The decomposition thus presents a solution to the problem of margin dependency, frequently discussed in the segregation literature. Finally, two terms account for the appearance or disappearance of units when analyzing change over time. The method can be further extended to attribute structural changes to individual units, which makes it possible, for instance, to quantify the effect of each occupation on changing gender* segregation. The practical advantages of the decomposition are illustrated by two examples: a study of changing occupational gender segregation in the United States and a study of changing residential segregation in Brooklyn, New York.

With an increasing number of questions, respondents can become bored, tired, and annoyed and may take shortcuts to reduce the effort needed to complete the survey. In this article, direct evidence is presented on how the position of items within a web questionnaire influences respondents' focus of attention. In two experiments, part of an eye-tracking study and an online survey, respectively, a variety of indicators show that data quality is lower if the experimental question is positioned at the end rather than at the beginning of a questionnaire. Practical implications are discussed.

AB Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) is often used to estimate the effects of socioeconomic status (SES) on academic achievement at different levels of an educational system. However, if a prior academic achievement measure is missing in a HLM model, biased estimates may occur on the effects of student SES and school SES. Phantom effects describe the phenomenon in which the effects of student SES and school SES disappear once prior academic achievement is added to the model. In the present analysis, partial simulation (i.e., simulated data are used together with real-world data) was employed to examine the phantom effects of student SES and school SES on science achievement, using the national sample of the United States from the 2015 Programme for International Student Assessment. The results showed that the phantom effects of student SES and school SES are rather real. The stronger the correlation between prior science achievement and (present) science achievement, the greater the chance that the phantom effects occur.

TI Combining Multiple Organizational-level Databases: An Empirical
   Evaluation of Different Matching Methods

   methods; interorganizational relationships; innovation
AB Although multiple organizational-level databases are frequently combined into one data set, there is no overview of the matching methods (MMs) that are utilized because the vast majority of studies does not report how this was done. Furthermore, it is unclear what the differences are between the utilized methods, and it is unclear whether research findings might be influenced by the utilized method. This article describes four commonly used methods for matching databases and potential issues. An empirical comparison of those methods used to combine regularly used organizational-level databases reveals large differences in the number of observations obtained. Furthermore, empirical analyses of these different methods reveal that several of them produce both systematic and random errors. These errors can result in erroneous estimations of regression coefficients in terms of direction and/or size as well as an issue where truly significant relationships might be found to be insignificant. This shows that research findings can be influenced by the MM used, which would argue in favor of the establishment of a preferred method as well as more transparency on the utilized method in future studies. This article provides insight into the matching process and methods, suggests a preferred method, and should aid researchers, reviewers, and editors with both combining multiple databases and describing and assessing them.

TI Fairness in Criminal Justice Risk Assessments: The State of the Art
SO SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE risk assessment; machine learning; fairness; criminal justice;
   discrimination
AB Objectives: Discussions of fairness in criminal justice risk assessments typically lack conceptual precision. Rhetoric too often substitutes for careful analysis. In this article, we seek to clarify the trade-offs between different kinds of fairness and between fairness and accuracy. Methods: We draw on the existing literatures in criminology, computer science, and statistics to provide an integrated examination of fairness and accuracy in criminal justice risk assessments. We also provide an empirical illustration using data from arraignments. Results: We show that there are at least six kinds of fairness, some of which are incompatible with one another and with accuracy. Conclusions: Except in trivial cases, it is impossible to maximize accuracy and fairness at the same time and impossible simultaneously to satisfy all kinds of fairness. In practice, a major complication is different base rates across different legally protected groups. There is a need to consider challenging trade-offs. These lessons apply to applications well beyond criminology where assessments of risk can be used by decision makers. Examples include mortgage lending, employment, college admissions, child welfare, and medical diagnoses.

TI Does Speculation Belong in Social Science Research?
SO SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH

DT Article
DE speculation; theory; empirical research; philosophy of science;

AB This article addresses the following question: Can speculation be used in social science research or should this not be an option? The secondary literature on speculation, which is minimal, is presented and discussed. It is noted that natural scientists often differentiate between a scientific form of speculation and the old metaphysical form of speculation. Following the lead of Charles Lave and James March in An Introduction to Models in the Social Sciences, close attention is also paid to the kind of speculation that is part of ordinary research, as opposed to the extraordinary type of speculation that can be found in the work of geniuses like Newton or Galileo. An attempt is then made to outline situations in which it is not only helpful but also necessary to speculate in social science. It is concluded that speculation is an important tool for social scientists if used with caution.

AB An innovative mixed-methods approach to exploratory focus group design is presented using a case study conducted with smallholder rice farmers in Vietnam. Understanding human decision-making under the uncertainties of a complex and changing social and environmental context requires a flexible yet structured and theoretically grounded approach. Using Bayesian belief networks as the architecture of our model allows the study to incorporate both qualitative and quantitative data, the former gathered at this stage in a participatory focus group setting and the latter to be collected in a subsequent survey. This framework further lends itself well to incorporating systematic behavioral approaches to decision-making analysis using Ajzen's theory of planned behavior framework, a symbiosis that remains underexplored in the literature. The visual nature of the networks makes them easily accessible to participants, and the proposed technical solutions to field implementation are flexible, inexpensive, and shown in practice to mitigate issues of co-moderating discussion across language barriers. The tools and methods described are transparent, reproducible in comparative contexts, and transferable to a range of research topics and questions.

SO SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE social science; history; selection bias; historical evidence;
   historiography; criterial framework
AB The historical turn in social science has prompted scholars to engage with the work of historians on a large scale. Here, social scientists face two standard problems of selection bias: confirmation bias and convenience sampling. So far, the record of dealing with these problems has been poor, and little has been done to specify how social scientists can sift a broader body of historiography. We present a criterial framework that describes how social scientists can mitigate bias when using historical studies. We term the idea behind this framework the Ulysses Principle because it can be understood as a way of avoiding the siren call of confirmation bias when using historical sources as the primary evidentiary base. The framework includes considerations about conceptual consistency, the theoretical vantage points of historical sources, and updated evidence. The three criteria and the trade-offs between them are illustrated using two recent examples from comparative historical analyses.

AB Since the early 2000s, the proliferation of cameras, whether in mobile phones or CCTV, led to a sharp increase in visual recordings of human behavior. This vast pool of data enables new approaches to analyzing situational dynamics. Application is both qualitative and quantitative and ranges widely in fields such as sociology, psychology, criminology, and education. Despite the potential and numerous applications of this approach, a consolidated methodological frame does not exist. This article draws on various fields of study to outline such a frame, what we call video data analysis (VDA). We discuss VDA's research agenda, methodological forebears, and applications, introduce an analytic tool kit, and discuss criteria for validity. We aim to establish VDA as a methodological frame and an interdisciplinary analytic approach, thereby enhancing efficiency and comparability of studies, and communication among disciplines that employ VDA. This article can serve as a point of reference for current and future practitioners, reviewers, and interested readers.

DT Article
DE eye tracking; visual context effects; images; Web surveys; fixation
AB Most research on images in surveys has examined how images affect answers to questions, which are known as visual context effects. Less frequently studied is how respondents process images in surveys and how variation in processing impacts observing visual context effects. Using data from two eye-tracking studies, we found that less than half of the respondents looked at the images in our surveys and that rates of looking at the images and time spent processing them significantly differed by gender. Additionally, we found that those who looked at the images for at least 60 milliseconds had their responses influenced by the images. The visual context effects did not occur for respondents who did not fixate on the images. Our findings suggest researchers must be cautious when placing images in surveys, given the possibility of visual context effects and variation of these effects by whether respondents fixate on the images, which could vary among subgroups.

AB Advances in computer science and computational linguistics have yielded new, and faster, computational approaches to structuring and analyzing textual data. These approaches perform well on tasks like information extraction, but their ability to identify complex, socially constructed, and unsettled theoretical concepts-a central goal of sociological content analysis-has not been tested. To fill this gap, we compare the results produced by three common computer-assisted approaches-dictionary, supervised machine learning (SML), and unsupervised machine learning-to those produced through a rigorous hand-coding analysis of inequality in the news (N = 1,253 articles). Although we find that SML methods perform best in replicating hand-coded results, we document and clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, including how they can complement one another. We argue that content analysts in the social sciences would do well to keep all these approaches in their toolkit, deploying them purposefully according to the task at hand.

AB Identifying inattentive respondents in self-administered surveys is a challenging goal for survey researchers. Instructed response items (IRIs) provide a measure for inattentiveness in grid questions that is easy to implement. The present article adds to the sparse research on the use and implementation of attention checks by addressing three research objectives. In a first study, we provide evidence that IRIs identify respondents who show an elevated use of straightlining, speeding, item nonresponse, inconsistent answers, and implausible statements throughout a survey. Excluding inattentive respondents, however, did not alter the results of substantive analyses. Our second study suggests that respondents' inattentiveness partially changes as the context in which they complete the survey changes. In a third study, we present experimental evidence that a mere exposure to an IRI does not negatively or positively affect response behavior within a survey. A critical discussion on using IRI attention checks concludes this article.

DE social class; measurement reliability; Krippendorff's alpha;
   Erikson-Goldthorpe-Portocarero class scheme; occupational classification
AB Periodic changes in occupational classifications make it difficult to obtain consistent measures of social class over time, potentially jeopardizing research on class-based trends. The severity of this problem depends, in part, on the measurement strategies used to address those changes. The authors propose that when a sample has been coded partly with one occupational classification and partly with another, Krippendorff's index alpha be used to identify the best strategy for measuring class consistently across the two classifications and to assess the reliability of the class measure employed in the final analyses. This index can be computed regardless of the metric of the class variable; it can be used to compare measures based on different class schemes or that use different metrics; and statistical inference is straightforward, even with a complex sampling design. The authors put the index to work in conducting a case study of the effects of the switch from the 1970 to the 1980 U.S. Census Bureau Classification of Occupations on the reliability of Erikson-Goldthorpe-Portocarero class measures. Their findings indicate that measurement strategies that seem a priori equally reasonable vary substantially in terms of their reliability, and that the bulk of this variation is accounted for by the extent to which the strategies rely on subjective judgments about the relationships between occupational and class classifications. Most importantly, as long as the best-performing measurement strategies are used, the switch in occupational classifications appears to be substantially less consequential than has been previously argued. A computer program made available as a companion to the paper makes estimation of Krippendorff's alpha, and statistical inference, very simple endeavors for nominal class variables.

DE attitudes; hybrid choice model; latent class analysis; stated choice
   experiment; stated preferences
AB Multifactorial survey experiments such as stated choice experiments are used more and more frequently in social science research. In this article, based on an experimental study on ethical and political consumption, we explore the potential of hybrid choice models to explicitly model latent psychological factors such as attitudes, overcoming a possible endogeneity bias and misrepresentation of causality. To this end, we employ a hybrid latent class choice model (HLCCM) in which the latent class structure allocates individuals to classes according to underlying latent attitudes that also influence the answers to attitudinal questions. This allows, in line with sociological action theories, a theory-guided testing of preference segmentation and modification caused by attitudes. We compare the complex HLCCM with less complex models that do not take the latent variable nature of attitudes into account and discuss in which cases less complex models might be more appropriate. However, the HLCCM always has the advantage of providing structure for theory testing and is therefore a useful tool to uncover preference heterogeneity, preference modification, and decision-making processes in sociological and other social science research.

DE multiple data inflations; generalized inflated discrete models; maximum
   likelihood estimator; probabilities of inflation; Monte Carlo

AB Analysts of discrete data often face the challenge of managing the tendency of inflation on certain values. When treated improperly, such phenomenon may lead to biased estimates and incorrect inferences. This study extends the existing literature on single-value inflated models and develops a general framework to handle variables with more than one inflated value. To assess the performance of the proposed maximum likelihood estimator, we conducted Monte Carlo experiments under several scenarios for different levels of inflated probabilities under multinomial, ordinal, Poisson, and zero-truncated Poisson outcomes with covariates. We found that ignoring the inflations leads to substantial bias and poor inference of the inflations-not only for the intercept(s) of the inflated categories but other coefficients as well. Specifically, higher values of inflated probabilities are associated with larger biases. By contrast, the generalized inflated discrete models (GIDMs) perform well with unbiased estimates and satisfactory coverages even when the number of parameters that need to be estimated is quite large. We showed that model fit criteria, such as Akaike information criterion, could be used in selecting the appropriate specifications of inflated models. Lastly, the GIDM was implemented using large-scale health survey data as a comparison to conventional modeling approaches such as various Poisson and Ordered Logit models. We showed that the GIDM fits the data better in general. The current work provides a practical approach to analyze multimodal data that exists in many fields, such as heaping in self-reported behavioral outcomes, inflated categories of indifference and neutral in attitude surveys, large amounts of zero, and low occurrences of delinquent behaviors.

AB Markov models are important tools for quantitative social research. In this article, new methods for discrete Markov chains are presented. These methods allow us to calculate the distribution of the occupation time in a subset of the state space, the distribution of the waiting time to first entry into a subset of the state space, and the distribution of the waiting time to final exit from a subset of the state space. To demonstrate the usefulness of these methods, we apply them to working life tables for Spanish males to assess how the recent financial crisis affected the length of working life. The results show that the duration of working life decreased considerably, a pattern that can largely be explained by later entry to and earlier exit from the labor market. The findings also indicate that inequality in the length of working life increased.

TI A Cautionary Note on the Reliability of the Online Survey Data: The Case
   of Wage Indicator
SO SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE wage indicator; online surveys; propensity score matching; weights
AB We investigate the reliability of data from the Wage Indicator (WI), the largest online survey on earnings and working conditions. Comparing WI to nationally representative data sources for 17 countries reveals that participants of WI are not likely to have been representatively drawn from the respective populations. Previous literature has proposed to utilize weights based on inverse propensity scores, but this procedure was shown to leave reweighted WI samples different from the benchmark nationally representative data. We propose a novel procedure, building on covariate balancing propensity score, which achieves complete reweighting of the WI data, making it able to replicate the structure of nationally representative samples on observable characteristics. While rebalancing assures the match between WI and representative benchmark data sources, we show that the wage schedules remain different for a large group of countries. Using the example of a Mincerian wage regression, we find that in more than a third of the cases, our proposed novel reweighting assures that estimates obtained on WI data are not biased relative to nationally representative data. However, in the remaining 60 percent of the analyzed 95 data sets, systematic differences in the estimated coefficients of the Mincerian wage regression between WI and nationally representative data persist even after reweighting. We provide some intuition about the reasons behind these biases. Notably, objective factors such as access to the Internet or richness appear to matter, but self-selection (on unobservable characteristics) among WI participants appears to constitute an important source of bias.

AB How household-level data from censuses and surveys are analyzed to study household structure is an issue that has received little attention. The present study proposes a new methodological approach to address this gap. Specifically, we introduce the idea of the household configuration as a mathematical representation of observations from the household roster that uses the tools of sequence analysis to study relationships between household members. This "household configuration approach" is statistically efficient, captures the heterogeneity of family forms in a population, and is computationally simple. An application to Canadian census data for Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples shows that our approach can yield interesting insights into household structure, otherwise not readily obtained.

The discussion is based on a summer 2016 survey experiment we conducted in Jos, Nigeria, to gather information regarding residents' perceptions of local communal violence. We discuss the challenges of such research and our approach to randomized sampling, constructing treatments that minimize the stress to respondents, debriefing to lower the possibility of spreading rumors of conflict, and utilizing computer tablets to increase access to the study for respondents with varying languages and levels of literacy. In particular, we discuss a geographic sampling method used for randomization, which we hope will prove useful to others facing similar randomization challenges.

AB This contribution deals with effect measures for covariates in ordinal data models to address the interpretation of the results on the extreme categories of the scales, evaluate possible response styles, and motivate collapsing of extreme categories. It provides a simpler interpretation of the influence of the covariates on the probability of the response categories both in standard cumulative link models under the proportional odds assumption and in the recent extension of the Combination of Uncertainty and Preference of the respondents models, the mixture models introduced to account for uncertainty in rating systems. The article shows by means of marginal effect measures that the effects of the covariates are underestimated when the uncertainty component is neglected. Visualization tools for the effect of covariates are proposed, and measures of relative size and partial effect based on rates of change are evaluated by the use of real data sets.

AB We present a set of studies the objective of which was to test the robustness of the acknowledgment of earned entitlement effect across different experimental modes and populations. We present three sets of results. The first is derived from a between-subject analysis of two independent, but comparable samples of nonstudent adults. One sample participated in a standard, behavioral laboratory experiment and the other participated in a survey experiment. The two methods returned similar treatment effects. The second set of results relates to a sample of students drawn from a behavioral laboratory's pool of registered subjects. They participated in both the behavioral lab and survey experiments. We perform a between-subject comparison of the two treatment-elicitation methods but, this time, focusing on the same sample of subjects. Again, the treatment effects are very similar. Finally, we establish that within-subjects there is some consistency between decisions made under the two methods.

AB The need to determine the correct dimensionality of theoretical constructs and generate valid measurement instruments when underlying items are categorical has generated a significant volume of research in the social sciences. This article presents two studies contrasting different categorical exploratory techniques. The first study compares Mokken scale analysis (MSA) and two-factor-based exploratory techniques for noncontinuous variables: item factor analysis and Normal Ogive Harmonic Analysis Robust Method (NOHARM). Comparisons are conducted across techniques and in reference to the common principal component analysis model using simulated data under conditions of two-dimensionality with different degrees of correlation (r = .0 to .6). The second study shows the theoretical and practical results of using MSA and NOHARM (the factorial technique which functioned best in the first study) on two nonsimulated data sets. The nonsimulated data are particularly interesting because MSA was used to solve a theoretical debate. Based on the results from both studies, we show that the ability of NOHARM to detect dimensionality and scalability is similar to MSA when the data comprise two uncorrelated latent dimensions; however, NOHARM is preferable when data are drawn from instruments containing latent dimensions weakly or moderately correlated. This article discusses the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

AB This article pushes forward a critical dialogue about the value of visualization as a method of sociological theorizing. Building on a nascent literature, I argue theory diagrams may operate not only conjunctively but also disjunctively, independent from empirics; that their theoretical value lies not only in capturing sociological problems but also in the inferential procedures they embody; that their creative use spans not only deduction and abduction but also induction; that abduction may be pursued with diagrams not only in conjunction with deduction or in the production of visual sketches but also in visual exercises in theoretical play geared primarily toward getting new ideas; and that theory visuals often feature metaphorical aspects that, like their linguistic cousins, transfer thought patterns from one domain to another, thereby providing a major avenue for visual theoretical creativity. Taken together, pursuing these lines of thought helps to build a better understanding of how visualization contributes to the creative intellectual practice of sociological theorizing.

AB Social scientists are often interested in estimating the marginal effects of a time-varying treatment on an end-of-study continuous outcome. With observational data, estimating these effects is complicated by the presence of time-varying confounders affected by prior treatments, which may lead to bias in conventional regression and matching estimators. In this situation, inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted (IPTW) estimation of a marginal structural model remains unbiased if treatment assignment is sequentially ignorable and the conditional probability of treatment is correctly modeled, but this method is not without limitations. In particular, it is difficult to use with continuous treatments, and it is relatively inefficient. This article explores using an alternative regression-based method-regression-with-residuals (RWR) estimation of a constrained structural nested mean model-that may overcome some of these limitations in practice. It is unbiased for the marginal effects of a time-varying treatment if treatment assignment is sequentially ignorable, the treatment effects of interest are invariant across levels of the confounders, and a model for the conditional mean of the outcome is correctly specified. The performance of RWR estimation relative to IPTW estimation is evaluated with a series of simulation experiments and with an empirical example based on longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Results indicate that it may outperform IPTW estimation in certain situations.

ID INCOME INEQUALITY
AB Newly precise evidence of the trajectory of top incomes in the United States and around the world relies on shares and ratios, prompting new inquiry into their properties as inequality measures. Current evidence suggests a mathematical link between top shares and the Gini coefficient and empirical links extending as well to the Atkinson measure. The work reported in this article strengthens that evidence, making several contributions: First, it formalizes the shares and ratios, showing that as monotonic transformations of each other, they are different manifestations of a single inequality measure, here called TopBot. Second, it presents two standard forms of TopBot, which satisfy the principle of normalization. Third, it presents a new link between top shares and the Gini coefficient, showing that properties and results associated with the Lorenz curve pertain as well to top shares. Fourth, it investigates TopBot in mathematically specified probability distributions, showing that TopBot is monotonically related to classical measures such as the Gini, Atkinson, and Theil measures and the coefficient of variation. Thus, TopBot appears to be a genuine inequality measure. Moreover, TopBot is further distinguished by its ease of calculation and ease of interpretation, making it an appealing People's measure of inequality. This work also provides new insights, for example, that, given nonlinearities in the (monotonic) relations among inequality measures, Spearman correlations are more appropriate than Pearson correlations and that weakening of correlations signals differences and shifts in distributional form, themselves signals of income dynamics.

ID INFERENCE
AB Advice on case selection in small-N research emphasizes controlling for confounding variables to facilitate inferential tests of a cross-case pattern. Yet many researchers embrace the "mechanismic worldview" and aim to construct explanations. Explanations differ from inferences because one explains an outcome at the individual case level. Hence, explanatory case studies are not simultaneously inferential tests, rendering prevailing case selection guidance ill fitting. This article provides an alternative outlook on case studies and case selection. It conceives of case studies as things that engage an analytical ideal type. Researchers can construct case-specific explanations by coupling the general claims of an ideal type with contextual analysis. In terms of case selection, if a case has contextual features that make it relatable to an ideal type, one can viably study that case in relation to the ideal type, regardless of the case's other characteristics. This criterion diverges sharply from the conventional wisdom on case selection and can embolden unconventional comparisons.

AB Agent-based modeling holds great potential as an analytical tool. Agent-based models (ABMs) are, however, also vulnerable to critique, as they often employ stylized social worlds, with little connection to the actual environment in question. Given these concerns, there has been a recent call to more fully incorporate empirical data into ABMs. This article falls in this tradition, exploring the benefits of using sampled ego network data in ABMs of cultural diffusion. Thus, instead of relying on full network data, which can be difficult and costly to collect, or no empirical network data, which is convenient but not empirically grounded, we offer a middle-ground, one combining ABMs with recent work on network sampling. The main question is whether this approach is effective. We provide a test of the approach using six complete networks; the test also includes a range of diffusion models (where actors follow different rules of adoption). For each network, we take a random ego network sample and use that sample to infer the full network structure. We then run a diffusion model through the known, complete networks, as well as the inferred networks, and compare the results. The results, on the whole, are quite strong: Across all analyses, the diffusion curves based on the sampled data are very similar to the curves based on the true, complete network. This suggests that ego network sampling can, in fact, offer a practical means of incorporating empirical data into an agent-based model.

AB New technologies transform research specialties and potentiate new fields. Sociometers-wearable electronic sensors collecting quantitative, dynamic data about embodied social interactions at hyperfine scales-represent such a possibility for small group research. This article introduces this new method and its distinctive qualities and affordances. Next, we relate its potential for advancing understanding of three types of small group phenomena: (1) rhythmic entrainment, emotional energy, and solidarity; (2) nonverbal dominance and deference; and (3) groups as complex systems. We then present findings from two pilot studies of small group creativity in science and art collaborations. To do so, we combine sociometric, survey, and ethnographic data to consider how speech participation, body movement, and volume shape group creativity and to illustrate how sociometric data complements traditional qualitative and quantitative methods. We close by relating practical lessons learned to aid future researchers working to harness this powerful new research technology.

AB Longitudinal social network studies can easily suffer from insufficient statistical power. Studies that simultaneously investigate change of network ties and change of nodal attributes (selection and influence studies) are particularly at risk because the number of nodal observations is typically much lower than the number of observed tie variables. This article presents a simulation-based procedure to evaluate statistical power of longitudinal social network studies in which stochastic actor-oriented models are to be applied. Two detailed case studies illustrate how statistical power is strongly affected by network size, number of data collection waves, effect sizes, missing data, and participant turnover. These issues should thus be explored in the design phase of longitudinal social network studies.

AB Postelection surveys regularly overestimate voter turnout by 10 points or more. This article provides the first comprehensive documentation of the turnout gap in three major ongoing surveys (the General Social Survey, Current Population Survey, and American National Election Studies), evaluates explanations for it, interprets its significance, and suggests means to continue evaluating and improving survey measurements of turnout. Accuracy was greater in face-to-face than telephone interviews, consistent with the notion that the former mode engages more respondent effort with less social desirability bias. Accuracy was greater when respondents were asked about the most recent election, consistent with the hypothesis that forgetting creates errors. Question wordings designed to minimize source confusion and social desirability bias improved accuracy. Rates of reported turnout were lower with proxy reports than with self-reports, which may suggest greater accuracy of proxy reports. People who do not vote are less likely to participate in surveys than voters are.

AB Ordinary kriging, a spatial interpolation technique, is commonly used in social sciences to estimate neighborhood attributes such as physical disorder. Universal kriging, developed and used in physical sciences, extends ordinary kriging by supplementing the spatial model with additional covariates. We measured physical disorder on 1,826 sampled block faces across four U.S. cities (New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, and San Jose) using Google Street View imagery. We then compared leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy between universal and ordinary kriging and used random subsamples of our observed data to explore whether universal kriging could provide equal measurement accuracy with less spatially dense samples. Universal kriging did not always improve accuracy. However, a measure of housing vacancy did improve estimation accuracy in Philadelphia and Detroit (7.9 percent and 6.8 percent lower root mean square error, respectively) and allowed for equivalent estimation accuracy with half the sampled points in Philadelphia. Universal kriging may improve neighborhood measurement.

AB Questionnaire design is routinely guided by classic experiments on question form, wording, and context conducted decades ago. This article explores whether two question order effects (one due to the norm of evenhandedness and the other due to subtraction or perceptual contrast) appear in surveys of probability samples in the United States and 11 other countries (Canada, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom;N= 25,640). Advancing theory of question order effects, we propose necessary conditions for each effect to occur, and found that the effects occurred in the nations where these necessary conditions were met. Surprisingly, the abortion question order effect even appeared in some countries in which the necessary condition was not met, suggesting that the question order effect there (and perhaps elsewhere) was not due to subtraction or perceptual contrast. The question order effects were not moderated by education. The strength of the effect due to the norm of evenhandedness was correlated with various cultural characteristics of the nations. Strong support was observed for the form-resistant correlation hypothesis.

AB Religious group size, demographic composition, and the dynamics thereof are of interest in many areas of social science including migration, social cohesion, parties and voting, and violent conflict. Existing estimates however are of varying and perhaps poor quality because many countries do not collect official data on religious identity. We propose a method for accurately measuring religious group demographics using existing survey data: Bayesian multilevel regression models with poststratification. We illustrate this method by estimating the demography of Muslims, Hindus, and Jews in Great Britain over a 20-year period and validate it by comparing our estimates to UK census data on religious demography. Our estimates are very accurate, differing from true population proportions by as little as 0.29 (Muslim) to 0.04 (Jewish) percentage points. These findings have implications for the measurement of religious demography as well as small group attributes more generally.

AB Count responses with grouping and right censoring have long been used in surveys to study a variety of behaviors, status, and attitudes. Yet grouping or right-censoring decisions of count responses still rely on arbitrary choices made by researchers. We develop a new method for evaluating grouping and right-censoring decisions of count responses from a (semisupervised) machine-learning perspective. This article uses Poisson multinomial mixture models to conceptualize the data-generating process of count responses with grouping and right censoring and demonstrates the link between grouping-scheme choices and asymptotic distributions of the Poisson mixture. To search for the optimal grouping scheme maximizing objective functions of the Fisher information (matrix), an innovative three-stepMalgorithm is then proposed to process infinitely many grouping schemes based on Bayesian A-, D-, and E-optimalities. A new R package is developed to implement this algorithm and evaluate grouping schemes of count responses. Results show that an optimal grouping scheme not only leads to a more efficient sampling design but also outperforms a nonoptimal one even if the latter has more groups.

AB Unit nonresponse in panel data sets is often a source of bias. Why certain individuals attrite from longitudinal studies and how to minimize this phenomenon have been examined by researchers. However, this research has typically focused on data sets collected via telephone, postal mail, or face-to-face interviews. Moreover, this research usually focuses on using demographic characteristics such as educational attainment or income to explain variation in the incidence of unit nonresponse. We make two contributions to the existing literature. First, we examine the incidence of unit nonresponse in an Internet panel, a relatively new, and hence understudied, approach to gathering longitudinal data. Second, we hypothesize that personality traits, which typically remain unobserved and unmeasured in many data sets, affect the likelihood of unit nonresponse. Using data from an Internet panel that includes self-reported measures of personality in its baseline survey, we find that conscientiousness and openness to experience predict the incidence of unit nonresponse in subsequent survey waves, even after controlling for cognitive ability and demographic characteristics that are usually available and used by researchers to correct for unit nonresponse. We also test the potential to use paradata as proxies for personality traits related to unit nonresponse. Although we show that these proxies are correlated with personality traits and predict unit nonresponse in the same way as self-reported measures of personality traits, it is also possible that they capture other idiosyncrasies related to future survey completion. Our results suggest that obtaining explicit measures of personality traits or finding better proxies for them could be valuable for more fully addressing the potential bias that may arise as a result of unit nonresponse.

   Quadratic Rule
SO SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH

DT Article
DE missing data; missing values; incomplete data; multiple imputation;
   imputation
AB When using multiple imputation, users often want to know how many imputations they need. An old answer is that 2-10 imputations usually suffice, but this recommendation only addresses the efficiency of point estimates. You may need more imputations if, in addition to efficient point estimates, you also want standard error (SE) estimates that would not change (much) if you imputed the data again. For replicableSEestimates, the required number of imputations increases quadratically with the fraction of missing information (not linearly, as previous studies have suggested). I recommend a two-stage procedure in which you conduct a pilot analysis using a small-to-moderate number of imputations, then use the results to calculate the number of imputations that are needed for a final analysis whoseSEestimates will have the desired level of replicability. I implement the two-stage procedure using a new SAS macro called%mi_combineand a new Stata command called how_many_imputations.

ID RELAPSE PREVENTION; RECONCEPTUALIZATION; PARSIMONY
AB This article responds to the argued lack of clearly articulated, consistent, and agreed criteria that might be used by researchers for determining the adequacy of a given concept for a given task. It does so by describing the development of a framework of such criteria, presenting that framework, and illustratively applying it to the evaluation of the concept of warm-up in psychodrama. The framework comprises eight criteria in three categories: the intrinsic qualities of a concept (the criteria of clarity, comprehensiveness, parsimony, and resonance), the contextualization of a concept (differentiation and connectedness), and its application (epistemic utility and practical utility). Using the framework to evaluate the concept of warm-up in the context of its use in psychodrama suggests its potential to make significant differentiations. It is argued that this framework may contribute to evaluating other concepts in other contexts, although the extent of such generalizability remains to be ascertained.

AB The study of segregation is essential for understanding how place influences life outcomes. Traditional segregation indices rely heavily on the use of areal units for calculation, which risks introducing both measurement and interpretation error. Using individual-level data avoids many of the problems facing traditional area-level indices. However, few segregation indices currently exist that are capable of utilizing such data. Given that our understanding is only as good as our measurement, it is imperative that our measures accurately reflect our perceptions of segregation. Utilizing the recent release of the complete 1940 Census count data, this article details a new individual-level segregation measure-the shortest path isolation (SPI) index. The SPI index captures the degree of racial isolation experienced by an individual, regarding both distance and interpersonal contact. With West Philadelphia as a sample study area, this article highlights the benefits of the SPI index for studying segregation at the individual level.

AB People have been interested in social cohesion and its implications in different areas of social life from the classic sociology authors until today. Besides its multidimensional nature, this complex construct also faces the issue of measurement. For this reason, the objective of this article is to adapt and validate a scale that measures in a multidimensional way social cohesion for urban areas. The results obtained through Cronbach's alpha coefficient, McDonald's omega coefficient, and confidence intervals for both coefficients show that the resulting questions have high levels of discrimination and an acceptable reliability, so the scale developed is valid methodologically.

Three probit regression estimators are considered, using model-based and model-assisted approaches. The theoretical properties of the proposed estimators are derived and discussed. Monte Carlo experiments were carried out for simulated data and for real data taken from a database of confirmed dengue cases in Mexico. The probit estimates give valuable results in comparison to alternative estimators. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to data obtained from an immigration survey.

AB Microblogging sites have become important data sources for studying network dynamics and information transmission. Both areas of study, however, require accurate counts of indegree, or follower counts; unfortunately, collection of complete time series on follower counts can be limited by application programming interface constraints, system failures, or temporal constraints. In addition, there is almost always a time difference between the point at which follower counts are queried and the time a user posts a tweet. Here, we consider the use of three classes of simple, easily implemented methods for follower imputation: polynomial functions, splines, and generalized linear models. We evaluate the performance of each method via a case study of accounts from 236 health organizations during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. For accurate interpolation and extrapolation, we find that negative binomial regression, modeled separately for each account, using time as an interval variable, accurately recovers missing values while retaining narrow prediction intervals.

AB I argue that what-makes-it-possible questions are a distinct and important kind of sociological research question. What is social phenomenonPmade possible or enabled by? Results won't be aboutP's causes and causal relationships, but about its enablers and enabling relationships. I examine the character of what-makes-it-possible questions and claims, how they can be empirically investigated, and what they're good for. If I'm right, they provide a unique perspective on social phenomena, they show how the social world doesn't come ready-made, and they open up new avenues for research.

AB One of the most important developments in the current era of social sciences is the growing availability and diversity of data, big and small. Social scientists increasingly combine information from multiple data sets in their research. While conducting statistical analyses with linked data is relatively straightforward, borrowing information across unlinked data can be much more challenging due to the absence of unit-to-unit linkages. This article proposes a new methodological approach for borrowing information acrossunlinkedsurveys to predict unobserved distributions. The gist of the proposed approach lies in the idea of using therelative densitybetween the observed and unobserved distributions in the reference data to characterize the difference between the two distributions and borrow that information to the base data. Relying on the assumption that the relative density between the observed and unobserved distributions is similar between data sets, the proposed relative density approach has the key advantage of allowing the researcher to borrow information about the shape of the distribution, rather than a few summary statistics. The approach also comes with a method for incorporating and quantifying the uncertainty in its output. We illustrate the formulation of this approach, demonstrate with simulation examples, and finally apply it to address the problem of employment selection in wage inequality research.

AB This article develops a framework for the causal analysis of critical events in case study research. A critical event is defined as a contingent event that is causally important for an outcome in a specific case. Using set-theoretic analysis, this article offers definitions and measurement tools for the study of contingency and causal importance in case study research. One set of tools consists of guidelines for using theoretical expectations to arrive at conclusions about the level of contingency of events. Another set of tools are guidelines for using counterfactual cases to determine the extent to which a given event is necessary and sufficient for a particular outcome in an individual case. Examples from comparative and international studies are used to illustrate the framework.

ID INTERCODER RELIABILITY; VALIDITY
AB This study investigates inter- and intracoder reliability, proposing a new approach based on social network analysis (SNA) and exponential random graph models (ERGM). During a recent exit poll, the responses of voters to two open-ended questions were recorded. A coding experiment was conducted where a group of coders coded a sample of text segments. Analyzing the data, we show that the proposed SNA/ERGM method extends significantly our analytical leverage, beyond what popular tools such as Krippendorff's alpha and Fleiss's kappa have to offer. The reliability of coding for individual coders differed significantly for the two questions although they were very similar and the same codebook was used. We conclude that the main advantages of the proposed SNA/ERGM method are the intuitive visualizations and the nuanced measurements. Detailed guidelines are provided for practitioners who would like to use the proposed method in operational settings.

AB Survey interviewers can negatively affect survey data by introducing variance and bias into estimates. When investigating these interviewer effects, research typically focuses on interviewer sociodemographics with only a few studies examining the effects of characteristics that are not directly visible such as interviewer attitudes, opinions, and personality. For the study at hand, self-reports of 1,212 respondents and 116 interviewers, as well as their interpersonal perceptions of each other, were collected in a large-scale, face-to-face survey of households in Germany. Respondents and interviewers were presented with the same questions regarding their opinions and mutual perceptions toward social and political issues in Germany. Analyses show that interviewer effects can be largely explained by how an interviewer is seen by respondents. This indicates that some respondents adjust their answers toward anticipated interviewer opinions. Survey practitioners ought to acknowledge this in their survey design and training of interviewers.

AB Fixed effects (FE) panel models have been used extensively in the past, as those models control for all stable heterogeneity between units. Still, the conventional FE estimator relies on the assumption of parallel trends between treated and untreated groups. It returns biased results in the presence of heterogeneous slopes or growth curves that are related to the parameter of interest (e.g., selection into treatment is based on individual growth of the outcome). In this study, we derive the bias in conventional FE models and show that fixed effects individual slope (FEIS) models can overcome this problem. This is a more general version of the conventional FE model, which accounts for heterogeneous slopes or trends, thereby providing a powerful tool for panel data and other multilevel data in general. We propose two versions of the Hausman test that can be used to identify misspecification in FE models. The performance of the FEIS estimator and the specification tests is evaluated in a series of Monte Carlo experiments. Using the examples of the marital wage premium and returns to preschool education (Head Start), we demonstrate how taking heterogeneous effects into account can seriously change the conclusions drawn from conventional FE models. Thus, we propose to test for bias in FE models in practical applications and to apply FEIS if indicated by the specification tests.

AB Causal search algorithms have been effectively applied in different fields including biology, genetics, climate science, medicine, and neuroscience. However, there have been scant applications of these methods in social and behavioral sciences. This article provides an illustrative example of how causal search algorithms can shed light on important social and behavioral problems by using these algorithms to find the proximal mechanisms of academic achievement. Using a nationally representative data set with a wide range of relevant contextual and psychological factors, I implement four causal search procedures that varied important dimensions in the algorithms. Consistent with previous research, the algorithms identified prior achievement, executive functions (in particular, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and attentional focusing), and motivation as direct causes of academic achievement. I discuss the advantages and limitations of graphical models in general and causal search algorithms in particular for understanding social and behavioral problems.

We developed Draw, Write, Reflect (DWR), advancing a known method, Draw and Write, for investigating phenomena relating to child participants, to explore a new context: adults engaging in academic careers. This article reports on the rationale behind the novel use of this research method, outlines a DWR procedure for future research, and contains reflections of both the researchers and the respondents regarding their experiences participating in DWR. Offering participants a combination of visual and oral methods allowed the researchers to obtain data in a more individualized approach steered by participants' preferences. The multidimensional insights obtained through DWR would not have been attainable through each method on its own. Furthermore, we argue arts-based research can serve as a vehicle for disseminating academic work beyond conventional academe to a growing, nonacademic audience.

AB This study proposes a two-stage causal modeling with instrumental variables to mitigate selection bias, provide correct standard error estimates, and address nonnormal and missing data issues simultaneously. Bayesian methods are used for model estimation. Robust methods with Student's t distributions are used to account for nonnormal data. Ignorable missing data are handled by multiple imputation techniques, while nonignorable missing data are handled by an added-on selection model structure. In addition to categorical treatment data, this study extends the work to continuous treatment variables. Monte Carlo simulation studies are conducted showing that the proposed Bayesian approach can well address common issues in existing methods. We provide a real data example on the early childhood relative age effect study to illustrate the application of the proposed method. The proposed method can be easily implemented using the R software package "ALMOND" (Analysis of Local Average Treatment Effect for missing or/and Nonnormal Data).

AB Recent years have seen a growing number of studies investigating the accuracy of nonprobability online panels; however, response quality in nonprobability online panels has not yet received much attention. To fill this gap, we investigate response quality in a comprehensive study of seven nonprobability online panels and three probability-based online panels with identical fieldwork periods and questionnaires in Germany. Three response quality indicators typically associated with survey satisficing are assessed: straight-lining in grid questions, item nonresponse, and midpoint selection in visual design experiments. Our results show that there is significantly more straight-lining in the nonprobability online panels than in the probability-based online panels. However, contrary to our expectations, there is no generalizable difference between nonprobability online panels and probability-based online panels with respect to item nonresponse. Finally, neither respondents in nonprobability online panels nor respondents in probability-based online panels are significantly affected by the visual design of the midpoint of the answer scale.

AB To date, hundreds of researchers have employed the method of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) for the purpose of causal inference. In a recent series of simulation studies, however, several authors have questioned the correctness of QCA in this connection. Some prominent representatives of the method have replied in turn that simulations with artificial data are unsuited for assessing QCA. We take issue with either position in this impasse. On the one hand, we argue that data-driven evaluations of the correctness of a procedure of causal inference require artificial data. On the other hand, we prove all previous attempts in this direction to have been defective. For the first time in the literature on configurational comparative methods, we lay out a set of formal criteria for an adequate evaluation of QCA before implementing a battery of inverse-search trials to test how this method performs in different recovery contexts according to these criteria. While our results indicate that QCA is correct when generating the parsimonious solution type, they also demonstrate that the method is incorrect when generating the conservative and intermediate solution type. In consequence, researchers using QCA for causal inference, particularly in human-sensitive areas such as public health and medicine, should immediately discontinue employing the method's conservative and intermediate search strategies.

AB This article aims to clarify the fundamental aspects of aggregating fuzzy scores of conditions with multiple attributes in fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Fuzzy multiple attribute conditions (FMACs) are conditions that are built using different types of concepts. FMACs are flexible conditions that express the ontological nature of the concept and deals with the causal heterogeneity. In fact, researchers can add a new attribute to a concept in order to consider the concept's meaning vis-a-vis to the outcome of interest instead of only considering the theory. In relation to FMAC fuzzy scores, we have individuated one problematic issue which is the aggregation strategy of attributes that are already calibrated that should be able to capture conceptual properties of membership and similarity. In this article, we will employ an empirical example in order to deal with causal heterogeneity and aggregation strategies. After discussing the disadvantages of the aggregation techniques used by QCA scholars, we individuate an axiomatic framework for defining logical conjunction operators that allows one to aggregate parts of concepts in accordance with membership and similarity. Then, we propose a technique to assign fuzzy scores to FMAC using the arithmetic mean-based compensatory fuzzy logic. This technique indirectly affects the solution formula(s) following the QCA and allows one to better locate cases in the XY plot during the post-QCA analysis.

AB Recent years have witnessed a host of innovations for conducting research with qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). Concurrently, important issues surrounding its uses have been highlighted. In this article, we seek to help users design QCA studies. We argue that establishing inference with QCA involves three intertwined design components: first, clarifying the question of external validity; second, ensuring internal validity; and third, explicitly adopting a specific mode of reasoning. We identify several emerging approaches to QCA rather than just one. Some approaches emphasize case knowledge, while others are condition oriented. Approaches emphasize either substantively interpretable or redundancy-free explanations, and some designs apply an inductive/explorative mode of reasoning, while others integrate deductive elements. Based on extant literature, we discuss issues surrounding inference with QCA and the tools available under different approaches to address these issues. We specify trade-offs and the importance of doing justice to the nature and goals of QCA in a specific research context.

AB Many sociological theories make critically different macropredictions when their microassumptions are implemented stochastically rather than deterministically. Deviations from individuals' behavioral patterns described by microtheories can spark cascades that change macrooutcomes, even when deviations are rare and random. With two experiments, we empirically tested whether macrophenomena can be critically shaped by random deviations. Ninety-six percent of participants' decisions were in line with a deterministic theory of bounded rationality. Despite this impressive microlevel accuracy, the deterministic model failed to predict the observed macrooutcomes. However, a stochastic version of the same microtheory largely improved macropredictions. The stochastic model also correctly predicted the conditions under which deviations mattered. Results also supported the hypothesis that nonrandom deviations can result in fundamentally different macrooutcomes than random deviations. In conclusion, we echo the warning that deterministic microtheories can be misleading. Our findings show that taking into account deviations in sociological theories can improve explanations and predictions.

AB Scholars increasingly rely on indirect questioning techniques to reduce social desirability bias and item nonresponse for sensitive survey questions. The major drawback of these approaches, however, is their inefficiency relative to direct questioning. We show how to improve the statistical analysis of the list experiment, randomized response technique, and endorsement experiment by exploiting auxiliary information on the sensitive trait. We apply the proposed methodology to survey experiments conducted among voters in a controversial antiabortion referendum held during the 2011 Mississippi General Election. By incorporating the official county-level election results, we obtain precinct- and individual-level estimates that are more accurate than standard indirect questioning estimates and occasionally even more efficient than direct questioning. Our simulation studies shed light on the conditions under which our approach can improve the efficiency and robustness of estimates based on indirect questioning techniques. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methodology.

AB Factorial surveys use a population of vignettes to elicit respondents' attitudes or beliefs about different hypothetical scenarios. However, the vignette population is frequently too large to be assessed by each respondent. Experimental designs such as randomized block confounded factorial (RBCF) designs, D-optimal designs, or random sampling designs can be used to construct small subsets of vignettes. In a simulation study, we compare the three vignette designs with respect to their biases in effect estimates and show how the biases arise from the designs' confounding structure, nonorthogonality, and unbalancedness. We particularly focus on the designs' sensitivity to context effects and misspecifications of the analytic model. We argue that RBCF designs and D-optimal designs are preferable to random sampling designs because they offer a stronger protection against undesirable confounding, context effects, and model misspecifications. We also discuss strategies for dealing with context and order effects since none of the basic vignette designs can satisfactorily handle them.

AB It is widely believed that regression models for binary responses are problematic if we want to compare estimated coefficients from models for different groups or with different explanatory variables. This concern has two forms. The first arises if the binary model is treated as an estimate of a model for an unobserved continuous response and the second when models are compared between groups that have different distributions of other causes of the binary response. We argue that these concerns are usually misplaced. The first of them is only relevant if the unobserved continuous response is really the subject of substantive interest. If it is, the problem should be addressed through better measurement of this response. The second concern refers to a situation which is unavoidable but unproblematic, in that causal effects and descriptive associations are inherently group dependent and can be compared as long as they are correctly estimated.

AB The observed increase in economic inequality, where the major concern is relative to the huge growth of the highest incomes, motivates to revisit classical measures of inequality and to offer new ways to synthesize the variability of the entire income distribution. The idea is to provide policy makers a way to contrast the economic position of the group of the poorer
   p
   percent of the population and to compare their mean income to the one owned by the
   p
   percent of the richest. The new measure is still a Lorenz-based one, but the significant focus is based here in equally sized and opposite parts of the population whose difference is so remarkable nowadays. We then highlight the specific information given by the new inequality measure and curve, by comparing it to the widely employed Lorenz curve and Gini index and the more recent Zenga approach, and provide an application to Italian data on household income, wealth, and consumption along the years 1980-2012. The effects of estimating inequality indices and curves from grouped data are also discussed.

ID PANEL-DATA; POWER
AB An interaction in a fixed effects (FE) regression is usually specified by demeaning the product term. However, algebraic transformations reveal that this strategy does not yield a within-unit estimator. Instead, the standard FE interaction estimator reflects unit-level differences of the interacted variables. This property allows interactions of a time-constant variable and a time-varying variable in FE to be estimated but may yield unwanted results if both variables vary within units. In such cases, Monte Carlo experiments confirm that the standard FE estimator of x . z is biased if x is correlated with an unobserved unit-specific moderator of z (or vice versa). A within estimator of an interaction can be obtained by first demeaning each variable and then demeaning their product. This "double-demeaned" estimator is not subject to bias caused by unobserved effect heterogeneity. It is, however, less efficient than standard FE and only works with T > 2.

AB Applying qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to large Ns relaxes researchers' case-based knowledge. This is problematic because causality in QCA is inferred from a dialogue between empirical, theoretical, and case-based knowledge. The lack of case-based knowledge may be remedied by various robustness tests. However, being a case-based method, QCA is designed to be sensitive to such tests, meaning that also large-N QCA robustness tests must be evaluated against substantive knowledge. This article connects QCA's substantive-interpretation approach of causality to critical realism. From that perspective, it identifies relevant robustness tests and applies them to a real-data large-N QCA study. Robustness test findings are visualized in a robustness table, and this article develops criteria to substantively interpret them. The robustness table is introduced as a tool to substantiate the validity of causal claims in large-N QCA studies.

AB Measuring the similarity of stimuli is of great interest to a variety of social scientists. Spatial arrangement by dragging and dropping "more similar" targets closer together on the computer screen is a precise and efficient method to measure stimulus similarity. We present Qualtrics-spatial arrangement method (Q-SpAM), a feature-rich and user-friendly online version of spatial arrangement. Combined with crowdsourcing platforms, Q-SpAM provides fast and affordable access to similarity data even for large stimulus sets. Participants may spatially arrange up to 100 words or images, randomly selected targets, self-selected targets, self-generated targets, and targets self-marked in different colors. These and other Q-SpAM features can be combined. We exemplify how to collect, process, and visualize similarity data with Q-SpAM and provide R and Excel scripts to do so. We then illustrate Q-SpAM's versatility for social science, concluding that Q-SpAM is a reliable and valid method to measure the similarity of lots of stimuli with little effort.

AB There is a dearth of methodological guidance on how to conduct participant observation in private spaces such as family homes. Yet, participant observations can provide deep and valuable data about family processes. This article draws on two ethnographic studies of family life in which researchers conduct in-depth interviews, recruit families, and ultimately enter the family as a quasi-stranger for daily observations lasting a fixed period (e.g., three weeks). We term this approach "intensive family observations." Here, we provide concrete methodological advice for this method, beginning with guidelines for recruitment and gaining consent. We also discuss logistics of conducting family observation (e.g., scheduling, spatial positionality in the home, role in the field, among other issues). We elaborate on the key challenges, specifically issues of intrusion, power, and positionality. Last, we reflect on how this method provides opportunities for accurately capturing deeply intimate moments as well as unexpected insights.

AB The Cox proportional hazards model has been pervasively used in many social science areas to examine the effects of covariates on timing to an event. The standard Cox model is intended to study univariate survival data where there is a singular event of interest, which can only be experienced once. However, we may additionally wish to explore a number of other complexities that are prevalent in survival data. For example, an individual may experience events of the same type more than once or may experience multiple types of events. This study introduces innovations in recurrent (repeatable) event analysis, jointly modeling several endogenous survival processes. As an example and an application, we simultaneously model two types of recurrent events in the presence of a dependent terminal event. This model not only correctly handles different types of recurrent events but also explicitly estimates the direction and magnitude of relationships between recurrences and survival. This article concludes with an example of the model to examine how the timing of retirement is associated with the risks of multiple spells of employment and childbearing. The theoretical discussions and empirical analyses suggest that the multivariate joint models have much to offer to a wide variety of substantive research areas.

AB Reluctance of respondents to participate in surveys has long drawn the attention of survey researchers. Yet, little is known about what drives a respondent's decision to answer the survey invitation early or late during the field period. Moreover, we still lack evidence on response timing in longitudinal surveys. That is, the questions on whether response timing is a rather stable respondent characteristic and what-if anything-affects change in response timing across different interviews remain open. We relied on data from a mixed-mode general population panel survey collected between 2014 and 2016 to study the stability of response timing across 18 panel waves and factors that influence the decision to participate early or late in the field period. Our results suggest that the factors which had effects on response timing are different in the mail and web modes. Moreover, we found that experience with prior panel waves affected the respondent's decision to participate early or late. Overall, the present study advocates understanding response timing as a metric variable and, consequently, the need to reflect this in modeling strategies.

AB We propose some theoretical and empirical advances by supplying the methodology for analyzing the factors that influence two sensitive variables when data are collected by randomized response (RR) survey modes. First, we provide the framework for obtaining the maximum likelihood estimates of logistic regression coefficients under the RR simple and crossed models, then we carry out a simulation study to assess the performance of the estimation procedure. Finally, logistic regression analysis is illustrated by considering real data about cannabis use and legalization and about abortion and illegal immigration. The empirical results bring out certain considerations about the effect of the RR and direct questioning survey modes on the estimates. The inference about the sign and the significance of the regression coefficients can contribute to the debate on whether the RR approach is an effective survey method to reduce misreporting and improve the validity of analyses.

AB When comparing social science phenomena through a time perspective, absolute and relative difference (RD) are the two typical presentation formats used to communicate interpretations to the audience, while time distance (TD) is the least frequently used of such formats. This article argues that the chosen presentation format is extremely important because the various formats suggest different substantive interpretations. To elaborate upon this issue, researchers from the National Statistical Office, National Health Institute, and general academia were invited to participate in an experiment with alternative presentation formats that describe changes in certain social science phenomena over time. The results revealed a prevailing tendency of respondents to rely on interpretations related to absolute differences, which was additionally reinforced with graphical presentation formats. Therefore, whenever RD or TD is more proper for substantive interpretations, the corresponding presentation format must be designed with special attention.

This article presents a brief history of graphical representations of research findings and makes the case for a revival of methods developed in the early and mid-twentieth century, notably ISOTYPE and Chernoff's faces. It resurrects and improves a procedure, clustered iconography, which enables the presentation of multidimensional data through which readers engage more effectively with the presentation's central message by way of an easier understanding of relationships between variables. The proposed technique is especially well adapted to the needs and protocols of open-source research.

AB The recent popularity of models that capture the dynamic coevolution of both network structure and behavior has driven the need for summary indices to assess the adequacy of these models to reproduce dynamic properties of scientific or practical importance. Whereas there are several existing indices for assessing the ability of the model to reproduce network structure over time, to date there are few indices for assessing the ability of the model to reproduce individuals' behavior patterns. Drawing on the widely used strategy of assessing model adequacy by comparing index values summarizing features of the observed data to the distribution of those index values on simulated data from the fitted model, we propose four goals that a researcher could reasonably expect of a joint structure/behavior model regarding how well it captures behavior and describe indices for assessing each of these. These reasonably simple and easily implemented indices can be used for assessing model adequacy with any dynamic network models jointly working with networks and behavior, including the stochastic actor-based models implemented within software packages such as RSien version 1.2-24. We demonstrate the use of our indices with an empirical example to show how they can be employed in practical settings, with an additional extension to modeling affiliation dynamics in two-mode networks. Key scripts are provided in the Supplemental Document (which can be found at ).

AB Randomized response techniques (RRTs) are useful survey tools for estimating the prevalence of sensitive issues, such as the prevalence of doping in elite sports. One type of RRT, the unrelated question model (UQM), has become widely used because of its psychological acceptability for study participants and its favorable statistical properties. One drawback of this model, however, is that it does not allow for detecting cheaters-individuals who disobey the survey instructions and instead give self-protecting responses. In this article, we present refined versions of the UQM designed to detect the prevalence of cheating responses. We provide explicit formulas to calculate the parameters of these refined UQM versions and show how the empirical adequacy of these versions can be tested. The Appendices contain R-code for all necessary calculations.

AB In 2018, a peer-reviewed article was published under the name of Richard Baldwin in which the author presented a critique of fat exclusion and advocated "fat bodybuilding" as a sport. Some months later, it became apparent that the article was intended as a hoax written to raise awareness to, or "expose", a certain ideology promoted by some academics. As a result, the editors retracted the article. Using the principles of methodological behaviorism, and other hoax or hoax-like articles, I will argue that the thoughts and opinions held by any author are not important to the argument they present. I will also argue that this form of reflexive ethnography is too problematic to serve as a method of enquiry. I will therefore conclude that the Baldwin article should be reinstated.

AB Researchers interested in studying the frequency of events or behaviors among a population must rely on count data provided by sampled individuals. Often, this involves a decision between live event counting, such as a behavioral diary, and recalled aggregate counts. Diaries are generally more accurate, but their greater cost and respondent burden generally yield less data. The choice of survey mode, therefore, involves a potential trade-off between bias and variance of estimators. We use a case study comparing inferences about payment instrument use based on different survey designs to illustrate this dilemma. We then use a simulation study to show how and under what conditions a hybrid survey design can improve efficiency of estimation, in terms of mean-squared error. Overall, our work suggests that such a hybrid design can have considerable benefits, as long as there is nontrivial overlap in the diary and recall samples.

AB Researchers are combining self-reports from mobile surveys with passive data collection using sensors and apps on smartphones increasingly more often. While smartphones are commonly used in some groups of individuals, smartphone penetration is significantly lower in other groups. In addition, different operating systems (OSs) limit how mobile data can be collected passively. These limitations cause concern about coverage error in studies targeting the general population. Based on data from the Panel Study Labour Market and Social Security (PASS), an annual probability-based mixed-mode survey on the labor market and poverty in Germany, we find that smartphone ownership and ownership of smartphones with specific OSs are correlated with a number of sociodemographic and substantive variables. The use of weighting techniques based on sociodemographic information available for both owners and nonowners reduces these differences but does not eliminate them.

AB The internal validity of observational study is often subject to debate. In this study, we define the counterfactuals as the unobserved sample and intend to quantify its relationship with the null hypothesis statistical testing (NHST). We propose the probability of a robust inference for internal validity, that is, the PIV, as a robustness index of causal inference. Formally, the PIV is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis again based on both the observed sample and the counterfactuals, provided the same null hypothesis has already been rejected based on the observed sample. Under either frequentist or Bayesian framework, one can bound the PIV of an inference based on his bounded belief about the counterfactuals, which is often needed when the unconfoundedness assumption is dubious. The PIV is equivalent to statistical power when the NHST is thought to be based on both the observed sample and the counterfactuals. We summarize the process of evaluating internal validity with the PIV into a six-step procedure and illustrate it with an empirical example.

AB Despite the fact that third parties are present during a substantial amount of face-to-face interviews, bystander influence on respondents' response behavior is not yet fully understood. We use nine waves of the German Family Panel pairfam and apply fixed effects panel regression models to analyze effects of third-party presence on items regarding the sharing of household tasks between partners. We find that both male and female respondents report doing a smaller share of household tasks when their partner is present during the interview as compared to when their partner is not present. Similarly, if the respondent's partner is present, both partners' reports correspond more, so that they are less prone to resulting in unrealistically high sums. These results indicate that for items concerning household labor, partner presence does not compromise data quality but may in fact improve it.

AB Surveys of income are complicated by the sensitive nature of the topic. The problem researchers face is how to encourage participants to respond and to provide truthful responses in surveys. To correct biases induced by nonresponse or underreporting, we propose a two-stage multilevel randomized response (MRR) technique to investigate the true level of income and to protect personal privacy. For a wide range of applications, we present a proportional odds model for two-stage MRR data and apply inverse probability weighting and multiple imputation methods to deal with covariates on some subjects that are missing at random. A simulation study is conducted to investigate the effects of missing covariates and to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. The practicality of the proposed methods is illustrated with the regular monthly income data collected in the Taiwan Social Change Survey. Furthermore, we provide an estimate of personal regular monthly mean income.

AB Automatically collected behavioral data on the location of users of mobile phones offer an unprecedented opportunity to measure mobilization in mass protests, while simultaneously expanding the range of researchable questions. Location data not only improve estimation of the number and composition of participants in large demonstrations. Thanks to high spatial and temporal resolution they also reveal when, where, and with whom different sociopolitical sectors join a protest campaign. This article compares the features and advantages of this type of data with other methods of measuring who participates in street protests. The steps in preparing a usable data set are explained with reference to a six-week campaign of mass mobilization in Israel in 2011. Findings based on the Israeli data set illustrate a wide range of potential applications, pertaining to both the determinants and consequences of protest participation. Limitations of mobile location data and the privacy issues it raises are also discussed.

AB The Everyday Discrimination Scale is the most commonly used instrument to assess discrimination. The survey asks respondents about a range of negative interpersonal experiences and then asks them to provide a single main reason for all these experiences. Theories of intersectionality cast doubt on the idea that marginalized individuals generally perceive a single reason for the discrimination they encounter. We analyze data from 23 cognitive interviews with racial/ethnic minority adults to assess the degree of difficulty respondents have in assessing the main reason for their mistreatment, the sources of this difficulty, and potential consequences. Of the 21 respondents who reported experiencing some form of everyday discrimination, 43 percent encountered some difficulty in identifying a single main reason for their experiences; 42 percent of women who perceived some form of discrimination evidence significant frustration in identifying a main reason. Analyses show that, by requiring respondents to identify a single reason for their experiences of discrimination, the resulting data likely provide underestimates-and potentially biased estimates-of particular forms of discrimination.

AB Most social scientists agree that case studies are useful for "theory building," but ethnographic methods papers often look to survey research for case selection strategies. This is due to a common but untenable distinction between theoretical and empirical generalization, which obscures how theoretically inclined ethnographers make implicit external validity claims. I analyze several exemplary ethnographies to show that (a) the distinction between theoretically and empirically oriented ethnography revolves around competing conventions for making claims that others accept as provisionally externally valid, (b) comparative-historical sociology provides a framework for evaluating how theoretically oriented ethnographies make such claims, and (c) each approach to making validity claims is optimized by different kinds of cases. Empirically oriented ethnographies make inductive claims via "pointy" cases wherein a phenomenon is pronounced or bifurcated. Theoretically oriented ethnographers are like post-Millian historical sociologist who triangulate past studies with resolutive or negative cases to make constitutive arguments.

AB This article proposes a three-step methodological framework called computational grounded theory, which combines expert human knowledge and hermeneutic skills with the processing power and pattern recognition of computers, producing a more methodologically rigorous but interpretive approach to content analysis. The first, pattern detection step, involves inductive computational exploration of text, using techniques such as unsupervised machine learning and word scores to help researchers to see novel patterns in their data. The second, pattern refinement step, returns to an interpretive engagement with the data through qualitative deep reading or further exploration of the data. The third, pattern confirmation step, assesses the inductively identified patterns using further computational and natural language processing techniques. The result is an efficient, rigorous, and fully reproducible computational grounded theory. This framework can be applied to any qualitative text as data, including transcribed speeches, interviews, open-ended survey data, or ethnographic field notes, and can address many potential research questions.

AB Test-retest reliability assessments rarely investigate whether reliability itself is stable or change in reliability affects findings from substantive models. Research across the social sciences often recognizes that measurement error could influence results, yet it rarely applies established error correction methods. Focusing on gender wage inequality, we address two questions. First, to what extent does reliability vary over time, across genders and across measurement protocols? Second, does correcting for measurement error influence substantive conclusions about gender wage inequality? Comparing British and Australian panel data, we find little temporal variability in reliability; however, measurement error effects are variable and sometimes substantial.

AB Unlike other data collection modes, the effect of labeling rating scales on reliability and validity, as relevant aspects of measurement quality, has seldom been addressed in online surveys. In this study, verbal and numeric rating scales were compared in split-ballot online survey experiments. In the first experiment, respondents' cognitive processes were observed by means of eye tracking, that is, determining the respondent's fixations in different areas of the screen. In the remaining experiments, data for reliability and validity analysis were collected from a German adult sample. The results show that respondents needed more fixations and more time to endorse a category when a rating scale had numeric labels. Cross-sectional reliability was lower and some hypotheses with respect to the criterion validity could not be supported when numeric rating scales were used. In conclusion, theoretical considerations and the empirical results contradict the current broad usage of numeric scales in online surveys.

   misunderstanding; unconventional pretest; data quality
AB The researcher, who pretests a questionnaire conventionally, is confident that a small number of interviews reveals numerous problems afflict the questionnaire. The standardized interviewer is asked to observe respondent's verbal behaviors in order to realize whether respondent misunderstands question. But this strategy fails when respondent does not show any misunderstanding signal. The study, reported in this article, illustrates how to exceed this limit, by means of the analysis of respondent's comments released in the flexible interview, which researcher uses to unveil incongruities between question and answer; the questions, when many respondents' misunderstandings occur, should be reworded. This study shows that the number of problems and the number of the problematic questions identified by this unconventional procedure are much higher than the number of problems and the number of problematic questions determined by the conventional pretesting. The strength of respondents' comments analysis is to discover problems the questionnaire poses for respondents, even when the respondents do not give any misunderstanding signal.

AB One of the main obstacles for survey researchers-especially those conducting surveys in difficult contexts such as postconflict areas-is accessing respondents. In order to address this problem, this article draws on an ongoing research project to reflect on the utility of mobile phones to connect with hard-to-access populations in conflict affected, low-income countries. It considers the strengths and weaknesses of a number of different mobile phone survey modes. The article goes a step further and discusses how (potential) survey respondents can be included in the survey design process thereby increasing the relevance of the research to them and hopefully encouraging them to participate. We conclude by considering the issue of "good enough" methodologies, or the need to balance methodological rigor with an understanding of the exigencies of suboptimal research contexts.

   norms
ID PUNISHMENT; JUSTICE; COMMUNICATION; COOPERATION; EVOLUTION; WOMEN
AB Survey-based experimental methods are increasingly used in the social sciences to study, among others, attitudes, norms, and fairness judgments. One of these methods is the factorial survey experiment (FSE or vignette experiment) in which respondents are confronted with various descriptions of situations that differ in a discrete number of attributes (or factors), and they are asked to evaluate those situations according to criteria such as agreement, approval, and fairness. Due to the systematic experimental variation of the presented situations, an FSE can separate effects of single situational attributes, allowing the causal influence of relevant situational attributes to be determined. This is the key advantage over simple survey items. While most studies using FSEs are carried out in developed countries in which respondents are familiar with surveys, we add further evidence that this method can also unfold its power in a developing context. Building on previous applications of FSEs in Africa, we demonstrate the usefulness of this method in four novel studies on social norms regarding the physical punishment of children and the social approval of technology adoption in Benin as well as judgments of just earnings in Rwanda. We also test for the first time the applicability of multiple vignettes per respondents in a Global South/remote area context. The results of these studies are theoretically meaningful and the overwhelming majority of respondents discriminate between vignettes. This supports the validity of FSEs. However, conducting survey experiments in developing countries is different from similar experimental research in developed countries and, therefore, we also discuss some of these differences and corresponding challenges. Last but not least, our article shows, provided a few precautions are heeded, that FSEs could be used as a vehicle to innovate social science research in a Global South/remote area context.

AB In the context of cross-sectional surveys, the scope of research on the impact of response enhancing strategies on sample composition and nonresponse bias is vast. This topic has rarely been addressed for panel studies, however, although these are becoming an increasingly important data source in social research. In this article, we evaluate the impact of reissuing wave nonrespondents on sample composition and survey estimates in the German Family Panel pairfam. In light of concerns about an adequate representation of life changes in panel studies, we focus on whether temporary dropouts improve sample composition in this respect: Using retrospective information from these cases provided at reentry, we approximate the impact of "lost" reports of life changes due to attrition. Our analysis reveals that the inclusion of temporary dropouts does increase sample variability regarding life changes. However, example analyses indicate that substantive conclusions would not be compromised if temporary dropouts were excluded.

AB In this article, we combine the extensive literature on the analysis of life-course trajectories as sequences with the literature on causal inference and propose a new matching approach to investigate the causal effect of the timing of life-course events on subsequent outcomes. Our matching approach takes into account pre-event confounders that are both time-independent and time-dependent as well as life-course trajectories. After matching, treated and control individuals can be compared using standard statistical tests or regression models. We apply our approach to the study of the consequences of the age at retirement on subsequent health outcomes, using a unique data set from Swedish administrative registers. Once selectivity in the timing of retirement is taken into account, effects on hospitalization are small, while early retirement has negative effects on survival. Our approach also allows for heterogeneous treatment effects. We show that the effects of early retirement differ according to preretirement income, with higher income individuals tending to benefit from early retirement, while the opposite is true for individuals with lower income.

AB In analyzing data from attitude surveys, it is common to consider the "don't know" responses as missing values. In this article, we present a statistical model commonly used for the analysis of responses/evaluations expressed on Likert scales and extended to take into account the presence of don't know responses. The main objective is to offer an alternative to the usual custom to treat them as missing values by considering them as a source of uncertainty. The original proposal in this article is the introduction of the relevant covariates in order to discriminate subpopulations that can show different behaviors in choosing between a substantive response and the don't know option.

AB Social scientists have frequently sought to understand the distinct effects of age, period, and cohort, but disaggregation of the three dimensions is difficult because cohort = period - age. We argue that this technical difficulty reflects a disconnection between how the cohort effect is conceptualized and how it is modeled in the traditional age-period-cohort framework. We propose a new method, called the age-period-cohort-interaction (APC-I) model, that is qualitatively different from previous methods in that it represents Ryder's theoretical account about the conditions under which cohort differentiation may arise. This APC-I model does not require problematic statistical assumptions and the interpretation is straightforward. It quantifies inter-cohort deviations from the age and period main effects and also permits hypothesis testing about intra-cohort life-course dynamics. We demonstrate how this new model can be used to examine age, period, and cohort patterns in women's labor force participation.

AB Measuring the existence and patterning of white flight (WF) using aggregate data has a long history in the social sciences. In this article, we assess past measurement approaches and identify several technical and conceptual limitations. To address these shortcomings, we propose a new multicomponent approach to detecting WF that requires tracts to exceed a minimum level of loss across four distinct dimensions of population change. Using both simulated and real data, we show that our approach provides stronger protection against common classification errors and behaves more consistently across a broad range of neighborhood types. We conclude with a substantive application that demonstrates the utility of our multicomponent approach to researchers who are interested in assessing the "buffering hypothesis." We find that our multicomponent approach detects higher levels of WF than recognized in previous studies, raising important questions about the formation and long-term stability of racially diverse neighborhoods in the United States.

AB This article presents an updated meta-analysis of survey experiments comparing the performance of the item count technique (ICT) and the direct questioning method. After synthesizing 246 effect sizes from 54 studies, we find that the probability that a sensitive item will be selected is .089 higher when using ICT compared to direct questioning. In recognition of the heterogeneity across studies, we seek to explain this variation by means of moderator analyses. We find that the relative effectiveness of ICT is moderated by cultural orientation in the context in which ICT is conducted (collectivism vs. individualism), the valence of topics involved in the applications (socially desirable vs. socially undesirable), and the number of nonkey items. In the Discussion section, we elaborate on the methodological implications of the main findings.

AB The ease at which online paradata can be captured in web surveys seems to increase social researchers' desire to collect such data. Yet little attention is paid to whether respondents actually approve of their collection. This article, therefore, studies online survey respondents' acceptance of automatically collecting their geographical locations. In wave 4 of the German Internet Panel, we asked respondents for their consent to automatically track their location using a JavaScript. Respondents were also asked to report their location in a set of traditional survey questions. About 62 percent of respondents consented to the automated collection of their location whereas 97 percent provided their location manually. With respect to consent biases, we find evidence that the composition of the achieved sample of geo-located respondents is biased and that the personal characteristics associated with respondents' willingness to be geo-located differ between the automated tracking and manual provision of geo-information.

AB While conflict event data sets are increasingly used in contemporary conflict research, important concerns persist regarding the quality of the collected data. Such concerns are not necessarily new. Yet, because the methodological debate and evidence on potential errors remains scattered across different subdisciplines of social sciences, there is little consensus concerning proper reporting practices in codebooks, how best to deal with the different types of errors, and which types of errors should be prioritised. In this article, we introduce a new analytical framework-that is, the Total Event Error (TEE) framework-which aims to elucidate the methodological challenges and errors that may affect whether and how events are entered into conflict event data sets, drawing on different fields of study. Potential errors are diverse and may range from errors arising from the rationale of the media source (e.g., selection of certain types of events into the news) to errors occurring during the data collection process or the analysis phase. Based on the TEE framework, we propose a set of strategies to mitigate errors associated with the construction and use of conflict event data sets. We also identify a number of important avenues for future research concerning the methodology of creating conflict event data sets.

AB Causal analyses typically focus on average treatment effects. Yet for substantive research on topics like inequality, interest extends to treatments' distributional consequences. When individuals differ in their responses to treatment, three types of inequality may result. Treatment may shape inequalities between subgroups defined by pretreatment covariates, it may induce more inequality in one subgroup than another, or it may polarize people across multiple dimensions of well-being. We introduce a model, called a covariance regression, that captures all three types of inequality via the means, variances, and correlations between multiple outcomes. The model can test for heterogeneous treatment effects, quantify the heterogeneity, and explain its structure using covariates. Finding that a treatment creates inequalities could drive theoretical refinement and inform policy decisions (targeting groups where payoffs will be most predictable). We illustrate the utility of covariance regressions by analyzing the effects of sharing information about income inequality on redistributive preferences.

ID BAYES FACTORS; HYPOTHESES
AB The Schwarz or Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is one of the most widely used tools for model comparison in social science research. The BIC, however, is not suitable for evaluating models with order constraints on the parameters of interest. This article explores two extensions of the BIC for evaluating order-constrained models, one where a truncated unit information prior is used under the order-constrained model and the other where a truncated local unit information prior is used. The first prior is centered on the maximum likelihood estimate, and the latter prior is centered on a null value. Several analyses show that the order-constrained BIC based on the local unit information prior works better as an Occam's razor for evaluating order-constrained models and results in lower error probabilities. The methodology based on the local unit information prior is implemented in the R package "BICpack" which allows researchers to easily apply the method for order-constrained model selection. The usefulness of the methodology is illustrated using data from the European Values Study.

AB Multilevel models are increasingly used in sociology and other social sciences to analyze variation of tie outcomes in egocentrically sampled network data, particularly in studies of social support. Existing research assumes that the personal networks in the data do not overlap (i.e., they do not have actors in common), which makes standard hierarchical models suitable for analysis. This assumption is unrealistic in certain sampling designs, including the case of egos sampled from higher level groups or via link-tracing methods. We describe different types of ego-network overlap and propose a method to detect overlapping actors and analyze the resulting data with cross-classified multilevel models. The method is demonstrated with an application to research on personal networks and social support among Hispanic immigrants in rural U.S. destinations. Overlap detection and modeling result in better model fit, more correct partition of tie variation among different sources, and the ability to test new substantive hypotheses.

ID AUTOREGRESSIVE MODEL; ECONOMETRICS
AB Spatial regression models provide the opportunity to analyze spatial data and spatial processes. Yet, several model specifications can be used, all assuming different types of spatial dependence. This study summarizes the most commonly used spatial regression models and offers a comparison of their performance by using Monte Carlo experiments. In contrast to previous simulations, this study evaluates the bias of the impacts rather than the regression coefficients and additionally provides results for situations with a nonspatial omitted variable bias. Results reveal that the most commonly used spatial autoregressive and spatial error specifications yield severe drawbacks. In contrast, spatial Durbin specifications (SDM and SDEM) and the simple spatial lag of X (SLX) provide accurate estimates of direct impacts even in the case of misspecification. Regarding the indirect "spillover" effects, several-quite realistic-situations exist in which the SLX outperforms the more complex SDM and SDEM specifications.

AB We first review existing literature on cumulative logit models along with various ways to test the parallel lines assumption. Building on the traditional frequentist framework, we introduce a method of Bayesian assessment of null values to provide an alternative way to examine the parallel lines assumption using highest density intervals and regions of practical equivalence. Second, we propose a new hyperparameter cumulative logit model that can improve upon existing ones in addressing several challenges where traditional modeling techniques fail. We use two empirical examples from health research to showcase the Bayesian approaches.

AB Meta-analysis is a statistical method that combines quantitative findings from previous studies. It has been increasingly used to obtain more credible results in a wide range of scientific fields. Combining the results of relevant studies allows researchers to leverage study similarities while modeling potential sources of between-study heterogeneity. This article provides a review of the core methodologies of meta-analysis that we consider most relevant to sociological research. After developing the foundation of the fixed- and random-effects models of meta-analysis models, this article illustrates the utility of the method with regression coefficients reported from two sets of social science studies. We explain the various steps of the process including constructing the meta-sample from primary studies, estimating the fixed- and random-effects models, analyzing the source of heterogeneity across studies, and assessing publication bias. We conclude with a discussion of steps that could be taken to strengthen the development of meta-analysis in sociological research, which will eventually increase the credibility of sociological inquiry via a knowledge-cumulative process.

   sufficiency
AB The main objective of the qualitative comparative analysis is to find solutions that display sufficient configurations of causal conditions leading to the presence of an outcome. These solutions should be less complex than the original observed configurations, as parsimonious as possible, without sacrificing the sufficiency requirement. Sufficiency and parsimony are two requirements that act in opposition, and an optimal solution is one that accommodates both. There are different search strategies that lead to different types of solutions, with an ongoing debate about which solution type is closest to the true, underlying causal structure. This article presents the different logics behind each simplification system in order to explain how and why they lead to different results and introduces the concept of "robust sufficiency" to clear the debate. It analyses the correctness ratios for the different solution type and provides an improved set of procedures to measure correctness that captures the best features from each system. Out of the competition between the conservative and the parsimonious search strategies, the intermediate solution emerges as the best hybrid that is suitable for causal analysis, outperforming the parsimonious solution in recovering a known (even parsimonious) causal structure.

AB In this article, we explore the use of Facebook targeted advertisements for the collection of survey data. We illustrate the potential of survey sampling and recruitment on Facebook through the example of building a large employee-employer linked data set as part of The Shift Project. We describe the workflow process of targeting, creating, and purchasing survey recruitment advertisements on Facebook. We address concerns about sample selectivity and apply poststratification weighting techniques to adjust for differences between our sample and that of "gold standard" data sources. We then compare univariate and multivariate relationships in the Shift data against the Current Population Survey and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997. Finally, we provide an example of the utility of the firm-level nature of the data by showing how firm-level gender composition is related to wages. We conclude by discussing some important remaining limitations of the Facebook approach, as well as highlighting some unique strengths of the Facebook targeted advertisement approach, including the ability for rapid data collection in response to research opportunities, rich and flexible sample targeting capabilities, and low cost, and we suggest broader applications of this technique.

AB Does X affect Y? Answering this question is particularly difficult if reverse causality is looming. Many social scientists turn to panel data to address such questions of causal ordering. Yet even in longitudinal analyses, reverse causality threatens causal inference based on conventional panel models. Whereas the methodological literature has suggested various alternative solutions, these approaches face many criticisms, chief among them to be sensitive to the correct specification of temporal lags. Applied researchers are thus left with little guidance. Seeking to provide such guidance, we compare how different panel models perform under a range of different conditions. Our Monte Carlo simulations reveal that unlike conventional panel models, a cross-lagged panel model with fixed effects not only offers protection against bias arising from reverse causality under a wide range of conditions but also helps to circumvent the problem of misspecified temporal lags.

ID MINIMIZATION
AB Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) is a relatively young method of causal inference that continues to diffuse across the social sciences. However, recent methodological research has found the conservative (QCA-CS) and the intermediate solution type (QCA-IS) of QCA to fail fundamental tests of correctness. Even under conditions otherwise ideal for causal discovery, both solution types frequently committed causal fallacies by presenting inferences that were in direct disagreement with the underlying data-generating structure to be discovered by QCA. None of these problems affected the parsimonious solution type (QCA-PS). These findings conflict with conventional wisdom in the QCA literature, which has it that QCA-CS uses empirical information only and that QCA-IS is preferable to both QCA-CS and QCA-PS. The present article resolves these contradictions. It shows that QCA-CS and QCA-IS systematically supplement empirical data with matching artificial data. These artificial data, however, regularly induce causal fallacies of severe magnitude. Researchers who employ QCA-CS or QCA-IS in empirical analyses thus always risk moving further away from the truth rather than closer to it.

AB The article explores the role that subjective evidence of causality and associated counterfactuals and counterpotentials might play in the social sciences where comparative cases are scarce. This scarcity rules out statistical inference based upon frequencies and usually invites in-depth ethnographic studies. Thus, if causality is to be preserved in such situations, a conception of ethnographic causal inference is required. Ethnographic causality inverts the standard statistical concept of causal explanation in observational studies, whereby comparison and generalization, across a sample of cases, are both necessary prerequisites for any causal inference. Ethnographic causality allows, in contrast, for causal explanation prior to any subsequent comparison or generalization.

AB Despite the recent and ongoing progress in using text-mining tools to automatically analyze large text corpora, there remains significant potential to facilitate the study of social action in social science research. In this context, particularly the disambiguation (who is referred to in a text?) and specification (which demographic characteristics are present?) of social actors-currently a manual job-remains a challenge. This article demonstrates a reliable and accurate software architecture for social scientists who are interested in automatically detecting, disambiguating, and demographically specifying social actors (i.e., persons and organizations) in large text collections. The backbone of our software architecture is the online encyclopedia Wikipedia as a currently unexploited data source of a large amount of accurately prepared information. We illustrate how our software architecture detects and disambiguates social actors in large text corpora and retrieves their respective demographic information. Overall, we evaluate the reliability and accuracy of our software architecture across seven different social settings and facilitate an intuitive sense of the comprehensive applicability of our software architecture. We end by not only highlighting the benefits of our software architecture for social science research but also pointing to the limitations of using Wikipedia as a data source.

ID GROWTH
AB Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is an influential methodological approach motivated by set theory and boolean logic. QCA proponents have developed algorithms to analyze quantitative data, in a bid to uncover necessary and sufficient conditions where causal relationships are complex, conditional, or asymmetric. This article uses computer simulations to show that researchers in the QCA tradition face a vexing double bind. On the one hand, QCA algorithms often require large data sets in order to recover an accurate causal model, even if that model is relatively simple. On the other hand, as data sets increase in size, it becomes harder to guarantee data integrity, and QCA algorithms can be highly sensitive to measurement error, data entry mistakes, or misclassification.

AB In this article, we examine whether cross-national studies disclose enough information for independent researchers to evaluate the validity and reliability of the findings (evaluation transparency) or to perform a direct replication (replicability transparency). The first contribution is theoretical. We develop a heuristic theoretical model including the actors, factors, and processes that influence the transparency of cross-national studies and provide an overview of the measures currently taken to improve research transparency. The second contribution is empirical, in which we analyze the level of transparency in published cross-national studies. Specifically, using a random sample of 305 comparative studies published in one of 29 peer-reviewed social sciences journals (from 1986 to 2016), we show that, even though all the articles include some methodological information, the great majority lack sufficient information for evaluation and replication. Lastly, we develop and propose a set of transparency guidelines tailored for reporting cross-national survey research.

AB Recent debates about qualitative methods have discussed the relative limitations and contributions of interviews in comparison to surveys and participant observation. These discussions have rarely considered how ethnographers themselves use interviews as part of their work. We suggest that Lizardo's discussion of three modes of culture (declarative, nondeclarative, and public) help us to understand the separate contributions of observation and interviews, with ethnographic interviews an especially helpful means of accessing different cultural modes. We also argue that Lizardo's conception of public culture should be divided into meso- and macrolevels and that this division helps to show the differing contributions of interviews within and without an ethnographic context. Developing our argument with data from the second author's ethnographic research and analysis of other scholars' ethnographies, we show how research that uses ethnographic interviews can help sociologists better understand how these four cultural modes interact.

AB Knowledge questions frequently are used in survey research to measure respondents' topic-related cognitive ability and memory. However, in self-administered surveys, respondents can search external sources for additional information to answer a knowledge question correctly. In this case, the knowledge question measures accessible and procedural memory. Depending on what the knowledge question aims at, the validity of this measure is limited. Thus, in this study, we conducted three experiments using a web survey to investigate the effects of task difficulty, respondents' ability, and respondents' motivation on the likelihood of searching external sources for additional information as a form of over-optimizing response behavior when answering knowledge questions. We found that the respondents who are highly educated and more interested in a survey are more likely to invest additional efforts to answer knowledge questions correctly. Most importantly, our data showed that for these respondents, a more difficult question design further increases the likelihood of over-optimizing response behavior.

AB Ethnography is made of relationships. Even when the observations the ethnographer writes of take place between others in the field, it is through the development of relationships that data are generated and through a particular relationship that interpretation is offered. In this introduction to the special issue about relationships and theorizing in ethnography, I outline three relevant dimensions of such relationships that aren't captured by current debates that center on power dynamics in the field: (a) Alignment. Going beyond the trifecta of race, class, and gender, I suggest that a key element of positionality includes the ways in which the ethnographer's projects align (or purposely fail to align) with those of her interlocutors; (b) Temporality. Thinking seriously about time allows us to appreciate how differences in the temporal arcs of research modulate the narrative arcs of theory as well as set the stage for the afterlife of participant observation in the process of writing and publishing; and (c) Place. As relationships deepen, ethnographers often find themselves in new spaces, complementing the temporality of narrative arcs with a different landscape of social theory. Doing so, this article calls for renewed attention to the way in which the patterned structure of relationships in the field shapes how ethnographers theorize their work.

AB This article examines the practices of ethnographers carrying out research in and, especially, on organizations. Ethnographers studying organizations, like other ethnographers, emphasize close observation and understanding the meaning of actions, words, and artifacts; they differ from other fieldworkers, though, in focusing on the organization itself, not just what happens inside it. Because fieldwork relationships are the core technology of organizational ethnography, this article argues, the challenges of studying organizations differ from the challenges of doing ethnography in other settings or with other analytic purposes precisely because the character of the organization and its activities shape what the researcher can and will study. This article discusses how fieldwork relationships are constrained and shaped as ethnographers submit their projects for ethics review, gain access to research sites, hang out in the organizations they are studying, interview informants, study organizational documents and paperwork, and handle requests to give back to the site.

ID STREET
AB Masking, the practice of hiding or distorting identifying information about people, places, and organizations, is usually considered a requisite feature of ethnographic research and writing. This is justified both as an ethical obligation to one's subjects and as a scientifically neutral position (as readers are enjoined to treat a case's idiosyncrasies as sociologically insignificant). We question both justifications, highlighting potential ethical dilemmas and obstacles to constructing cumulative social science that can arise through masking. Regarding ethics, we show, on the one hand, how masking may give subjects a false sense of security because it implies a promise of confidentiality that it often cannot guarantee and, on the other hand, how naming may sometimes be what subjects want and expect. Regarding scientific tradeoffs, we argue that masking can reify ethnographic authority, exaggerate the universality of the case (e.g., "Middletown"), and inhibit replicability (or "revisits") and sociological comparison. While some degree of masking is ethically and practically warranted in many cases and the value of disclosure varies across ethnographies, we conclude that masking should no longer be the default option that ethnographers unquestioningly choose.

AB Much contemporary ethnography hopes to engage with a community to justify social critique. Whether from problem selection, interpersonal rewards, or a desire for exchange, researchers often take the "side" of informants. Such an approach, linked to "public ethnography," marginalizes a once-traditional approach to fieldwork, that of the ethnographic stranger. I present a model of scholarly detachment and questioning of group interests. Drawing on my own experiences and those of members of the Second Chicago School, I argue for an approach in which an unaffiliated observer questions community interests, arguing that skepticism of local explanations can discover processes shared by other scenes and can develop transsituational concepts. While the ethnographer can be seduced into sharing a group's perspective, observational distancing can mitigate this. In an approach I label skeptical ethnography, the ethnographic stranger avoids partisan allegiance in the field and at the desk. Skepticism of local interests must be combined with an epistemic generosity that recognizes that all action, whether seemingly righteous or repellent, responds to an interaction order.

TI Tethered Venues: Discerning Distant Influences on a Field Site
SO SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE ethnography; professions; venues; tethers; medicine
AB Ethnographers often study those who periodically meet to interact in multiple venues. This article focuses on how people who share and engage in tasks in recurrently visited venues define and change their social projects' problems and solutions. To address the complexities of this "meta-work," I introduce the concept of "tethers." Tethers are links across venues that people use to set and shift these problems and solutions that are continuously being contested. Drawing on examples from the author's fieldwork and other ethnographic accounts of professional work, I examine three types of tethers: focal participants, things, and language. Paying attention to tethers also results in practical implications for managing subjects' use of the ethnographer as a tether, making decisions about what venues to observe, and developing strategies for focusing one's observations when in those venues. I argue that a focus on subjects' use of tethers across venues helps mitigate the challenges ethnographers face when accounting for the influence of temporally and geographically distant sites of recurrent interaction.

AB Radical social movements are broadly engaged in, and dedicated to, promoting change in their social environment. In their corresponding efforts to call attention to various causes, communicate with like-minded groups, and mobilize support for their activities, radical social movements also produce an enormous amount of text. These texts, like radical social movements themselves, are often (i) densely connected and (ii) highly variable in advocated protest activities. Given a corpus of radical social movement texts, can one uncover the underlying network structure of the radical activist groups involved in this movement? If so, can one then also identify which groups (and which subnetworks) are more prone to radical versus mainstream protest activities? Using a large corpus of British radical environmentalist texts (1992-2003), we seek to answer these questions through a novel integration of network discovery and unsupervised topic modeling. In doing so, we apply classic network descriptives (e.g., centrality measures) and more modern statistical models (e.g., exponential random graph models) to carefully parse apart these questions. Our findings provide a number of revealing insights into the networks and nature of radical environmentalists and their texts.

AB In the last 60 years, the proportion of white Americans expressing anti-black prejudice in face-to-face survey interviews has declined dramatically. To test whether social desirability pressures affect the expression of anti-black prejudice, we analyzed a within-subjects experiment in the 2008 American National Election Study in which white respondents first reported their endorsement of stereotypes of blacks confidentially via audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI) and weeks or months later orally during second interviews. Shifting to ACASI led to a small but significant increase in negative views of blacks. Unexpectedly, shifting to ACASI also led to a similarly large increase in negative views of whites. Furthermore, the ACASI reports had no more predictive validity than did the oral reports. This evidence suggests that social desirability pressures do not seriously compromise oral reports of racial stereotypes in face-to-face interviews.

AB Conventional advice discourages controlling for postoutcome variables in regression analysis. By contrast, we show that controlling for commonly available postoutcome (i.e., future) values of the treatment variable can help detect, reduce, and even remove omitted variable bias (unobserved confounding). The premise is that the same unobserved confounder that affects treatment also affects the future value of the treatment. Future treatments thus proxy for the unmeasured confounder, and researchers can exploit these proxy measures productively. We establish several new results: Regarding a commonly assumed data-generating process involving future treatments, we (1) introduce a simple new approach and show that it strictly reduces bias, (2) elaborate on existing approaches and show that they can increase bias, (3) assess the relative merits of alternative approaches, and (4) analyze true state dependence and selection as key challenges. (5) Importantly, we also introduce a new nonparametric test that uses future treatments to detect hidden bias even when future-treatment estimation fails to reduce bias. We illustrate these results empirically with an analysis of the effect of parental income on children's educational attainment.

ID INCOME INEQUALITY
AB In common sociological research, income inequality is measured only at the aggregate level. The main purpose of this article is to demonstrate that there is more than meets the eye when inequality is indicated by a single measure. In this article, I introduce an alternative method that evaluates individuals' contributions to inequality as well as the between-group and within-group components of these individual contributions. I first highlight three common inequality measures, the Gini index and two generalized entropy measures-Theil's T and Theil's L indices-by presenting their individual components as a method for evaluating inequality. Five artificial data examples illustrate the use of these individual components first. An empirical analysis of the 2007 and 2017 Current Population Survey data then focuses on the differences in inequality revealed by such individual inequality components between the 2007 and 2017. The individual-level inequality measures can reveal patterns of inequality concealed by single measures at the aggregate level. In particular, the Gini individual measures differentiate cases better than the generalized entropy measures and tend to have smaller standard errors in a regression analysis.

AB After nearly four decades of growth, the number of people held in U.S. prisons has begun to decline. In an era of decarceration, social scientists need to understand prisoner reentry experiences. Longitudinal studies are one strategy to accomplish this goal. Yet, the retention of a formerly incarcerated population across waves of interviews is challenging due to their transient lifestyles and limited support systems, which may be further complicated by gang involvement. This article details the longitudinal follow-up procedures used in the LoneStar Project-a multiwave study of 802 males first interviewed in prison and reinterviewed twice in the year postrelease-to build rapport, complete interviews, and minimize attrition. We then evaluate the effectiveness of our procedures on important outcomes including interview yields, appointments, and incoming calls. Results indicate that any outgoing contact with respondents via appointment reminders and other reciprocal modes of contact lead to greater project engagement and a greater likelihood of interview completion. We conclude with relevant takeaways for researchers seeking to maximize survey participation with hard-to-reach populations.

AB Most studies of the early origins of adult health rely on summing dichotomously measured negative exposures to measure childhood misfortune (CM), neglect, adversity, or trauma. There are several limitations to this approach, including that it assumes each exposure carries the same level of risk for a particular outcome. Further, it often leads researchers to dichotomize continuous measures for the sake of creating an additive variable from similar indicators. We propose an alternative approach within the structural equation modeling (SEM) framework that allows differential weighting of the negative exposures and can incorporate dichotomous and continuous observed variables as well as latent variables. Using the Health and Retirement Study data, our analyses compare the traditional approach (i.e., adding indicators) with alternative models and assess their prognostic validity on adult depressive symptoms. Results reveal that parameter estimates using the conventional model likely underestimate the effects of CM on adult health outcomes. Additionally, while the conventional approach inhibits testing for mediation, our model enables testing mediation of both individual CM variables and the cumulative variable. Further, we test whether cumulative CM is moderated by the accumulation of protective factors, which facilitates theoretical advances in life course and social inequality research. The approach presented here is one way to examine the cumulative effects of early exposures while attending to diversity in the types of exposures experienced. Using the SEM framework, this versatile approach could be used to model the accumulation of risk or reward in many other areas of sociology and the social sciences beyond health.

AB We explore the relations between the notion of distance and a feature set-based concept of similarity and show that this concept of similarity has a spatial interpretation that is complementary to distance: it is interpreted as "direction." Furthermore, we show how proper normalization leads to distances that can be directly interpreted as dissimilarity: Closeness in normalized space implies and is implied by similarity of the same objects, while remoteness implies and is implied by dissimilarity. Finally, we show how, in research into destandardization of the life course, properly normalizing may drastically and unequivocally change our interpretation of intercohortal distances.

AB The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition (BOD) is a popular method for studying the contributions of explanatory factors to social inequality. The results have often been given causal interpretations. While recent work and this article both show that some types of BOD are equivalent to a counterfactual-based treatment effect/selection bias decomposition, this equivalence does not hold in general. Given this lack of general equivalence, in this article based on the counterfactual framework, we propose a method of treatment effect deviation (TED) to study social inequality. Essentially, the TED assesses to what extent the omission of particular covariates (i.e., selection bias in the omitted variables) can alter the estimated treatment effect. The TED has a better causal interpretation and can be estimated nonparametrically (and hence is more robust to model misspecification errors). Therefore, the TED may serve as an alternative to or may be used in tandem with the BOD. We illustrate the new method through two case studies. In the first case study, we show that the TED provides a more credible estimate of the treatment effect on the treated than does the BOD. However, both the TED and the BOD highlight the importance of accounting for prior earning in estimating the training effect. In the second case study, the results of the two methods differ notably, but both agree that normative factors play a significant role in generating the rural-urban disparity in social policy preference in China.

AB Causal inference under treatment interference is a challenging but important problem. Past studies usually make strong assumptions on the structure of treatment interference in order to estimate causal treatment effects while accounting for the effect of treatment interference. In this article, we view treatment diffusion as a concrete form of treatment interference that is prevalent in social settings and also as an outcome of central interest. Specifically, we analyze data from a smoking prevention intervention conducted with 4,094 students in six middle schools in China. We measure treatment interference by tracing how the distributed intervention brochures are shared by students, which provides information to construct the so-called treatment diffusion networks. Besides providing descriptive analyses, we use exponential random graph models to model the treatment diffusion networks in order to reveal covariates and network processes that significantly correlate with treatment diffusion. We show that the findings provide an empirical basis to evaluate previous assumptions on the structure of treatment interference, are informative for imputing treatment diffusion data that is crucial for making causal inference under treatment interference, and shed light on how to improve designs of future interventions that aim to optimize treatment diffusion.

TI A Set-Theoretic Approach to Bayesian Process Tracing
SO SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Bayesian analysis; process tracing; set theory; possible worlds;
   hypothesis testing
AB This article develops a set-theoretic approach to Bayes's theorem and Bayesian process tracing. In the approach, hypothesis testing is the procedure whereby one updates beliefs by narrowing the range of states of the world that are regarded as possible, thus diminishing the domain in which the actual world can reside. By explicitly connecting Bayesian analysis to its set-theoretic foundations, the approach makes process tracing more intuitive and thus easier to apply for qualitative researchers. Moreover, the set-theoretic approach provides new tools for assessing both the consequentialness and expectedness of evidence when conducting process tracing. It also provides a new way to classify and interpret process-tracing tests, such as hoop tests and smoking gun tests, by viewing them as zones in a continuous space whose dimensions reflect the magnitude of changes in sets. The article shows that Bayesian process tracing and set-theoretic process tracing are not alternatives to each other but rather two sides of the same coin.

AB In face-to-face surveys, interviewer observations are a cost-effective source of paradata for nonresponse adjustment of survey estimates and responsive survey designs. Unfortunately, recent studies have suggested that the accuracy of these observations can vary substantially among interviewers, even after controlling for household-, area-, and interviewer-level characteristics, limiting their utility. No study has identified sources of this unexplained variance in observation accuracy. Motivated by theoretical expectations from the observer bias literature, this study analyzed more than 45,000 open-ended justifications provided by interviewers in the U.S. National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) for their observations on two key features of all sampled NSFG households: presence of children and expected probability of household response. The study finds that variability among interviewers in the cues used to record these observations (evident from the open-ended justifications) explains much of the previously unexplained variance in observation accuracy.

AB This article makes the case for shadowing as ethnographic methodology: focusing attention on what occurs as interlocutors move among settings and situations. Whereas ethnographers often zoom in on one principal set of situations or site, we argue that intersituational variation broadens and deepens the researcher's ethnographic account as well as affording important correctives to some common inferential pitfalls. We provide four warrants for shadowing: (a) buttressing intersituational claims, (b) deepening ethnographers' ability to trace meaning making by showing how meanings shift as they travel and how such shifts may affect interlocutors' understandings, (c) gaining leverage on the structure of subjects' social worlds, and (d) helping the ethnographer make larger causal arguments. We show the use value of these considerations through an analysis of violence and informal networks in an ethnography of immigrant Latinos who met to socialize and play soccer in a Los Angeles park.

AB Using Canadian data from 1976 to 2014, I study the size distribution of strikes with three alternative measures of strike size: the number of workers on strike, strike duration in calendar days, and the number of person calendar days lost to a strike. I use a maximum likelihood framework that provides a way to estimate distributions, evaluate model fit, and also test against alternative distributions. I consider a few theories that can create power law distributions in strike size, such as the joint costs model that posits strike size is inversely proportional to dispute costs. I find that the power law distribution fits the data for the number of lost person calendar days relatively well and is also more appropriate than the lognormal distribution. I also discuss the implications of my findings from a methodological, research, and policy perspective.

ID MODEL
AB The potential of social media to give insight into the dynamic evolution of public conversations, and into their reactive and constitutive role in political activities, has to date been underdeveloped. While topic modeling can give static insight into the structure of a conversation, and keyword volume tracking can show how engagement with a specific idea varies over time, there is need for a method of analysis able to understand how conversations about societal values evolve and react to events in the world by incorporating new ideas and relating them to existing themes. In this article, we propose a method for analyzing social media messages that formalizes the structure of public conversations and allows the sociologist to study the evolution of public discourse in a rigorous, replicable, and data-driven fashion. This approach may be useful to those studying the social construction of meaning, the origins of factionalism and internecine conflict, or boundary-setting and group-identification exercises and has potential implications.

AB Recently, both sociology of science and policy research have shown increased interest in scientific uncertainty. To contribute to these debates and create an empirical measure of scientific uncertainty, we inductively devised two systems of classification or ontologies to describe scientific uncertainty in a large corpus of food safety risk assessments with the help of machine learning (ML). We ask three questions: (1) Can we use ML to assist with coding complex documents such as food safety risk assessments on a difficult topic like scientific uncertainty? (2) Can we assess using ML the quality of the ontologies we devised? (3) And, finally, does the quality of our ontologies depend on social factors? We found that ML can do surprisingly well in its simplest form identifying complex meanings, and it does not benefit from adding certain types of complexity to the analysis. Our ML experiments show that in one ontology which is a simple typology, against expectations, semantic opposites attract each other and support the taxonomic structure of the other. And finally, we found some evidence that institutional factors do influence how well our taxonomy of uncertainty performs, but its ability to capture meaning does not vary greatly across the time, institutional context, and cultures we investigated.

AB Currently available (classical) testing procedures for the network autocorrelation can only be used for falsifying a precise null hypothesis of no network effect. Classical methods can be neither used for quantifying evidence for the null nor for testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously. This article presents flexible Bayes factor testing procedures that do not have these limitations. We propose Bayes factors based on an empirical and a uniform prior for the network effect, respectively, first. Next, we develop a fractional Bayes factor where a default prior is automatically constructed. Simulation results suggest that the first two Bayes factors show superior performance and are the Bayes factors we recommend. We apply the recommended Bayes factors to three data sets from the literature and compare the results to those coming from classical analyses using p values. R code for efficient computation of the Bayes factors is provided.

AB Although a wealth of literature exists studying the effect of sponsor characteristics on self-reports of mental health, little work assesses a related but potentially powerful effect: a context comprehension effect, that is, a change in the respondent's interpretation of a survey question, given the concept elicited by the interviewer. Further, most studies of sponsor effects assess mean differences in responses according to sponsor type; no work has studied how these effects can affect the reliability of a psychometric instrument, which are of general importance to sociological studies of health. Here, using a study of 169 recently discharged hospital patients, we find that both effects are likely to have affected responses and, together, negated the reliability of a psychometric instrument. Future studies should consider the effect of not only sponsor characteristics upon responses but also consider how questions might be interpreted given in an interview context.

AB A rapidly growing number of algorithms are available to researchers who apply statistical or machine learning methods to answer social science research questions. The unique advantages and limitations of each algorithm are relatively well known, but it is not possible to know in advance which algorithm is best suited for the particular research question and the data set at hand. Typically, researchers end up choosing, in a largely arbitrary fashion, one or a handful of algorithms. In this article, we present the Super Learner-a powerful new approach to statistical learning that leverages a variety of data-adaptive methods, such as random forests and spline regression, and systematically chooses the one, or a weighted combination of many, that produces the best forecasts. We illustrate the use of the Super Learner by predicting violence among inmates from the 2005 Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional Facilities. Over the past 40 years, mass incarceration has drastically weakened prisons' capacities to ensure inmate safety, yet we know little about the characteristics of prisons related to inmate victimization. We discuss the value of the Super Learner in social science research and the implications of our findings for understanding prison violence.

AB The social integration of a city depends on the extent to which people from different neighborhoods have the opportunity to interact with one another, but most prior work has not developed formal ways of conceptualizing and measuring this kind of connectedness. In this article, we develop original, network-based measures of what we call "structural connectedness" based on the everyday travel of people across neighborhoods. Our principal index captures the extent to which residents in each neighborhood of a city travel to all other neighborhoods in equal proportion. Our secondary index captures the extent to which travels within a city are concentrated in a handful of receiving neighborhoods. We illustrate the value of our indices for the 50 largest American cities based on hundreds of millions of geotagged tweets over 18 months. We uncover important features of major American cities, including the extent to which their connectedness depends on a few neighborhood hubs, and the fact that in several cities, contact between some neighborhoods is all but nonexistent. We also show that cities with greater population densities, more cosmopolitanism, and less racial segregation have higher levels of structural connectedness. Our indices can be applied to data at any spatial scale, and our measures pave the way for more powerful and precise analyses of structural connectedness and its effects across a broad array of social phenomena.

ID MODEL UNCERTAINTY; GROWTH EMPIRICS; SELECTION
AB Young and Holsteen (YH) introduce a number of tools for evaluating model uncertainty. In so doing, they are careful to differentiate their method from existing forms of model averaging. The fundamental difference lies in the way in which the underlying estimates are weighted. Whereas standard approaches to model averaging assign higher weight to better fitting models, the YH method weights all models equally. As I show, this is a nontrivial distinction, in that the two sets of procedures tend to produce radically different results. Drawing on both simulation and real-world examples, I demonstrate that in failing to distinguish between numerical variation and statistical uncertainty, the procedure proposed by YH will tend to overstate the amount of uncertainty resulting from variation across models. In standard circumstances, the quality of estimates produced using this method will tend to be objectively worse than that of conventional alternatives.

AB The commenter's proposal may be a reasonable method for addressing uncertainty in predictive modeling, where the goal is to predict y. In a treatment effects framework, where the goal is causal inference by conditioning-on-observables, the commenter's proposal is deeply flawed. The proposal (1) ignores the definition of omitted-variable bias, thus systematically omitting critical kinds of controls; (2) assumes for convenience there are no bad controls in the model space, thus waving off the premise of model uncertainty; and (3) deletes virtually all alternative models to select a single model with the highest R-2. Rather than showing what model assumptions are necessary to support one's preferred results, this proposal favors biased parameter estimates and deletes alternative results before anyone has a chance to see them. In a treatment effects framework, this is not model robustness analysis but simply biased model selection.

AB Using randomly ordered name generators, we tested the effect of name generators' relative position on the likelihood of respondents' declining to respond or satisficing in their response. An online survey of public health staff elicited names of information sources, information seekers, perceived experts, and friends. Results show that when name generators are asked later, they are more likely to go unanswered and respondents are more likely to respond that they do not know anyone or list fewer names. The effect of sequence was not consistent in different question types, which could be the result of the moderating effect of willingness to answer and question sensitivity.

AB Item characteristics can have a significant effect on survey data quality and may be associated with measurement error. Literature on data quality and measurement error is often inconclusive. This could be because item characteristics used for detecting measurement error are not coded unambiguously. In our study, we use a systematic coding procedure with multiple coders to investigate the extent to which the coding of item characteristics could be done reliably. For this purpose, we constructed an item characteristics scheme that is based on typologies of characteristics. High intercoder reliability indicates a clear relation between item characteristic, item content, and measurement error. Our results show that intercoder reliability is often low, especially for item characteristics that are hard to code due to subjectivity. Low intercoder reliability complicates comparisons between studies about item characteristics and measurement error. We give suggestions for coping with low intercoder reliability.

AB Our objective is the estimation of voter transitions between two consecutive parliamentary elections. Usually, such analyses have been based either on individual survey data or on aggregated data. To move beyond these methods and their respective problems, we propose the application of so-called hybrid models, which combine aggregate and individual data. We use a Bayesian approach and extend a multinomial-Dirichlet model proposed in the ecological inference literature. Our new hybrid model has been implemented in the R-package eiwild (= Ecological Inference with individual-level data). Based on extensive simulations, we are able to show that our new estimator exhibits a very good estimation performance in many realistic scenarios. Application case is the voter transition between the Bavarian Regional election and the German federal elections 2013 in the Metropolitan City of Munich. Our approach is also applicable to other areas of electoral research, market research, and epidemiology.

AB Participatory methods for engaging children and young people in research are becoming more popular and innovative in social research. One example of this is the inclusion of participant photography. Drawing on an ethnographic study conducted in Northern Ireland, this article explores the application of participant photography to research drug use and antisocial behavior among youth. Findings highlight issues surrounding implementation when in the field, building on the existing knowledge base and focusing on recruitment, continuous engagement, image presentation, and analysis. This is followed by an overview of ethical considerations including specific issues relating to researcher and participant safety.

AB Respondent-driven sampling (RDS), a link-tracing sampling and inference method for studying hard-to-reach populations, has been shown to produce asymptotically unbiased population estimates when its assumptions are satisfied. However, some of the assumptions are prohibitively difficult to reach in the field, and the violation of a crucial assumption can produce biased estimates. We compare two different inference approaches: design-based inference, which relies on the known probability of selection in sampling, and model-based inference, which is based on models of human recruitment behavior and the social context within which sampling is conducted. The advantage of the latter approach is that when the violation of an assumption has been shown to produce biased population estimates, the model can be adjusted to more accurately reflect actual recruitment behavior, and thereby control for the source of bias. To illustrate this process, we focus on three sources of bias, differential effectiveness of recruitment, a form of nonresponse bias, and bias resulting from status differentials that produce asymmetries in recruitment behavior. We first present diagnostics for identifying types of bias and then present new forms of a model-based RDS estimator that controls for each type of bias. In this way, we show the unique advantages of a model-based estimator.

AB In this article, a numerical method integrated with statistical data simulation technique is introduced to solve a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations with multiple random variable coefficients. The utilization of Monte Carlo simulation with central divided difference formula of finite difference (FD) method is repeated n times to simulate values of the variable coefficients as random sampling instead being limited as real values with respect to time. The mean of the n final solutions via this integrated technique, named in short as mean Monte Carlo finite difference (MMCFD) method, represents the final solution of the system. This method is proposed for the first time to calculate the numerical solution obtained for each subpopulation as a vector distribution. The numerical outputs are tabulated, graphed, and compared with previous statistical estimations for 2013, 2015, and 2030, respectively. The solutions of FD and MMCFD are found to be in good agreement with small standard deviation of the means, and small measure of difference. The new MMCFD method is useful to predict intervals of random distributions for the numerical solutions of this epidemiology model with better approximation and agreement between existing statistical estimations and FD numerical solutions.

AB Survey research is still confronted by a trend of increasing nonresponse rates. In this context, several methodological advances have been made to stimulate participation and avoid bias. Yet, despite the growing number of tools and methods to deal with nonresponse, little is known about whether nonresponse biases show similar trends as nonresponse rates and what mechanisms (if any) drive changes in bias. Our article focuses on biases in cohort distributions in the U.S. and German general social surveys from 1980 to 2012 as one of the key variables in the social sciences. To supplement our cross-national comparison of these trends, we decompose changes into within-cohort change (WCC) and between-cohort change. We find that biases in cohort distributions have remained relatively stable and at a relatively low level in both countries. Furthermore, WCC (i.e., survey climate) accounts for the major part of the change in nonresponse bias.

AB This study investigates the impact of different modes and tailor-made response enhancing measures (TMREM)-such as bilingual interviewers with a shared ethnic background and translated questionnaires-on the measurement of substantive variables in surveys among minority ethnic groups in the Netherlands. It also provides insight into the ability to detect mode measurement effects of a recently developed method for disentangling mode measurement and mode selection effects, as well as into the tenability of the assumptions underlying this method. The data used in this study come from a large-scale survey design experiment among the four largest non-Western minority ethnic groups in the Netherlands comparing single-mode computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) and sequential computer-assisted web interviewing, computer-assisted telephone interviewing, and CAPI-MM. The number and intensity of the TMREM varied among the four ethnic groups. The results show that mode measurement effects occur among all ethnic groups and are the result of a combination of the presence or absence of an interviewer and TMREM. Mode measurement effects occur more often on sociocultural questions, but also, on occasion, on more sociostructural or background questions. The method used to disentangle mode measurement and mode selection effects can be applied to detect mode measurement effects, but one should be cautious in interpreting them. Implausible mode measurement effects can be caused by the violation of the assumptions underlying this method.

This article includes four aspects of physical attractiveness (facial attractiveness, voice attractiveness, body mass index [BMI], and height) and reports that (1) interviewers with more attractive faces and lower BMI have higher cooperation rates, (2) differences in interviewers' personality (Big Five, Rosenberg self-esteem) account for about one third of the total effect of facial attractiveness on cooperation rates, and (3) being interviewed by a more attractive interviewer leads to more positive self-reports on physical appearance, weight, and health (but does not affect self-reports unrelated to physical appearance).

AB Information quality deficiencies have been detected in occupational safety and health surveys in Europe, which typically gather self-reported data responded by employers or their representatives. For instance, their low response rates and informant profiles make estimations on establishments with safety representatives (SRs) unreliable. We tested the mode of administration and informants as sources of error regarding establishments with SRs in Catalonia, Spain. Two sources of information were compared: the Second Catalan Survey of Working Conditions 2011 (IICSWC)-with a methodology similar to surveys conducted at the state and European level-and the Progam on Prevention of Risks Management in Companies (PPRMC)-in which the labor authority collected data using a documentary verification in another sample of establishments. Percentage of establishments with SRs was estimated using the data from the PPRMC and also the differences in percentage between sources and informant profiles (with 95 percent confidence interval). Results show that the IICSWC overestimates the percentage of establishments with SRs.

DT Article
DE social networks; statistical network modeling; ERGM; SAOM; Siena
ID P-ASTERISK MODELS; SOCIAL NETWORKS
AB Two approaches for the statistical analysis of social network generation are widely used; the tie-oriented exponential random graph model (ERGM) and the stochastic actor-oriented model (SAOM) or Siena model. While the choice for either model by empirical researchers often seems arbitrary, there are important differences between these models that current literature tends to miss. First, the ERGM is defined on the graph level, while the SAOM is defined on the transition level. This allows the SAOM to model asymmetric or one-sided tie transition dependence. Second, network statistics in the ERGM are defined globally but are nested in actors in the SAOM. Consequently, dependence assumptions in the SAOM are generally stronger than in the ERGM. Resulting from both, meso- and macro-level properties of networks that can be represented by either model differ substantively and analyzing the same network employing ERGMs and SAOMs can lead to distinct results. Guidelines for theoretically founded model choice are suggested.
