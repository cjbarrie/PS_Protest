AB This study investigates the unequal impact of natural hazard damage on people's residential instability over time by shifting analyses from an event-centered design common in disaster studies to a longitudinal, population-centered approach. To demonstrate this approach, we link annual data on property damages from natural hazards at the county level to geocoded data on nationally representative samples of men and women from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Results indicate that the average US household lives in a county that experiences five documented hazards per year, totaling $20 million in direct property damage. Findings also indicate that as local damages accrue over time, so does residential instability, net of other factors. This pattern is particularly strong for Black and Latina women, for whom measurable differences in personal and social resources interact with hazard damages to significantly increase residential instability over time.

TI Does Manufacturing Matter for Economic Growth in the Era of

AB This study adjudicates between two competing perspectives regarding the importance of manufacturing employment for economic growth with the onset of the most recent round of economic globalization. Established economic theories link shifts toward industrial activities to higher growth due to increases in aggregate productivity. While some scholars argue that the global restructuring of manufacturing in the era of globalization presents novel opportunities for development in the South, others suggest that the importance of manufacturing employment for economic growth in less developed countries declines during this period as competitive pressures increase and barriers to entry decline. I use difference models and a broad sample of both developed and less developed countries in the time period 1970-2010 to examine the effects of manufacturing share of employment on economic growth and how these effects have changed over time. First, I find that manufacturing employment has strong positive effects on economic growth net of neoclassical controls for all countries. Second, I find that for less developed countries, the importance of manufacturing share of employment for growth has declined through the course of the time period studied, particularly after 1990. In contrast, my results do not show a similar decline for developed countries. These findings are robust across alternative estimation strategies. I conclude by considering the theoretical implications of these results.

AB This paper analyzes cross-national and longitudinal variations in criminal laws regulating sexual activities. We blend historical and sociological institutionalisms to argue that criminal sex laws embody exogenous models, supplied by colonial and imperial powers and evolving world society. To test our ideas, we apply logit-panel and pooled-time-series models to original data from more than 150 countries on four aspects of sex laws, 1965 to 2005: (1) maximum prison terms for rape, (2) ages of sexual consent, (3) the existence of sodomy prohibitions, and (4) gender neutrality in adultery regulations. Our analyses confirm the importance of exogenous factors and show that endogenous factors-including the dominance of Islam and the status of women in society-play lesser roles in explaining formal content differences. In supplementary analyses, we explore counterpoint variations, that is, sex-law reforms that flout global standards, illustrated here by sodomy-law expansions during the period. We find exogenous imprints even in these cases.

AB This paper studies how socioeconomic attainments of parents in intact two-parent families, non-residential parents, single parents, and parents in stepfamilies affect children's attainments. In doing so, we draw together two lines of research: one on the inheritance of social status that consistently reports that children benefit from greater maternal and paternal resources, and another on family instability that argues that parental separation is associated with children's lower socioeconomic achievement in adulthood. The analyses are based on Finnish Census Panel data and sibling models, and socioeconomic statuses are measured by occupation-based ISEI scores. The results suggest that in terms of socioeconomic inheritance, fathers are replaceable: the influence of a non-residential father was very weak and was compensated by the strengthened effect of the single mother and by the further strong influence of a stepfather. The socioeconomic status of non-residential mothers and stepmothers contributed very little to a child's status. The socioeconomic attainments of children who had lived in single-parent families were lower than those of children who had been raised in intact two-parent families, but the differences were modest and varied with parental status. In absolute terms, the outcomes were poorest for children who lived with a low-status single parent, but the loss associated with parental separation was greatest for those who had high-status non-residential fathers. The total family background effect, measured as sibling similarities in socioeconomic attainment, was weaker in single-mother families than in other family types.

AB Optimistic assessments of life chances can positively influence life outcomes, but conflicting theories suggest these assessments either reflect structural privilege or develop as a result of childhood hardship. In addition, competing hypotheses suggest that these assessments may matter differently depending on who holds them. We examine whether family socioeconomic status shapes adolescents' expectations about how successful their lives will turn out. We distinguish generalized life expectations (GLE), capturing anticipated success in life across multiple domains, from intergenerational comparative expectations (ICE), which register expectations about improvement relative to observed success within the respondent's family lineage. We find that adolescents from higher socioeconomic status families are simultaneously more optimistic about their likely success in life (GLE) but less likely to anticipate relative improvement in life success across generations (ICE). Holding high GLE in combination with low ICE predicted doing better in adulthood across a range of health, attainment, and well-being outcomes, though in most cases high GLE, regardless of ICE, was the key. These beneficial patterns are, for the most part, at least as beneficial for socioeconomically disadvantaged youth as they are for advantaged youth.

AB Prior research on stratification beliefs has investigated individuals' understandings regarding the causes of poverty in America. These past studies have uncovered demographic characteristics associated with individualist and structuralist explanations for poverty. In the current study, we will argue that Americans, like social scientists, envision poverty as a heterogeneous and complex phenomenon. We utilize a cultural cognition theoretical approach to conceptualize these understandings of poverty as schemas. We contend that a schema of poverty contains a set of unique associations regarding both demographic beliefs (who the poor are) and causal attributions (why they are poor). Using original data in a mixed-methods design that incorporates inductive and experimental components, we find that people differentiate between two key types of poverty: intergenerational poverty and downward mobility. People perceive each type of poverty as caused by a different set of factors and as experienced by a different group of people. The type of poverty envisioned is, in most cases, as important as or more important than a respondent's own demographic characteristics in predicting what type of causal attributions he or she makes for poverty. These findings underscore the importance of investigating different schemas of poverty in future stratification beliefs research.

AB American public schools experienced a substantial reduction of black-white segregation after the Supreme Court ordered the immediate desegregation of Mississippi schools in 1969. Past research has shown that progress slowed by the 1990s, with some arguing that segregation actually began to rebound. This study is the first to examine enrollment data for each decade between 1970 and 2010 for a comprehensive set of districts across the country and also the first to include data for 1980 for a national sample of districts. It provides definitive evidence that most desegregation occurred in the 1970s, with little subsequent change. It also addresses two questions about the desegregation process. First, how closely was it tied to court orders for a particular school district or for a neighboring district? Desegregation was greatest in response to a legal mandate, but it also extended to districts that never faced court action. Second, what was the effect of mandates on white flight? White student enrollment declined generally in these decades but more in districts that faced a mandate in the immediate past decade. White flight contributed to a modest increase in segregation between school districts, but desegregation within districts was sufficient to result in a large net decline at a metropolitan level.

AB Persistent school segregation may allow advantaged groups to hoard educational opportunities and consign minority students to lower-quality educational experiences. Although minority students are concentrated in low-achieving schools, relatively little previous research directly links segregation to measures of school quality based on student achievement growth, which more plausibly reflect learning opportunities. Using a dataset of public elementary schools in California, this study provides the first analysis detailing the distribution of a growth-based measure of school quality using standard inequality indices, allowing disparities to be decomposed across geographic and organizational scales. We find mixed support for the school opportunity hoarding hypothesis. We find small White and Asian advantages in access to high-growth schools, but most of the inequality in exposure to school growth is within racial groups. Growth-based disparities both between and within groups tend to be on a more local scale than disparities in absolute achievement levels, focusing attention on within-district policies to mitigate school-based inequalities in opportunities to learn.

AB Despite the passage of numerous laws in Latin America, impunity in domestic violence cases remains a serious concern throughout the region. This article draws on feminist theories of the state to analyze how the routine practices of low-level state bureaucrats impact women's experiences navigating legal institutions in urban Nicaragua. Drawing on ten months of ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews, I show how, contrary to theories of representative bureaucracy, the increased presence of women officials within state institutions does not improve most women's treatment by police or prosecutors. Rather, only when women have access to specific forms of social capital are their cases granted legitimacy by state actors. This article illustrates the routine practices by which gendered governance operates, as well as how feminist organizations disrupt patterns of bureaucratic indifference by assuming the banner of legitimacy that is rarely afforded to women victims themselves. These findings raise critical questions about the efficacy of traditional legal and bureaucratic strategies for eliminating violence against women, and suggest that one key alternative is to strengthen the capacities of civil society organizations that provide accompaniment to women victims.

AB With continuing immigration to Western countries, an important question concerns how these demographic changes impact natives' propensity to vote. In particular, the literature debates whether exposure to ethnic others in local contexts generates conflict that mobilizes individuals to vote (mobilization theory), diminishes social cohesion that in turn makes voters likely to withdraw from voting (marginalization theory), or does not impact turnout at all. This study is one of the first to investigate the question using individual-level longitudinal data, which adds substantially to the causal leverage of the analysis. In particular, we use a panel dataset with validated turnout data for 1.9 million Danish voters combined with detailed data regarding the ethnic composition of individuals' proximate residential neighborhood. The results suggest that increasing shares of immigrants does not affect natives' propensity to vote to any substantive extent, irrespective of how the size of the neighborhood is specified. This finding cannot be ascribed to lack of statistical power. Hereby, the study provides an important contribution to the existing knowledge regarding the democratic consequences of continuing immigration and increasing ethnic diversity.

TI The Paradox of Community Power: Cultural Processes and Elite Authority
   in Participatory Governance
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID GRASS-ROOTS; POLITICS
AB From town halls to public forums, disadvantaged neighborhoods appear more "participatory" than ever. Yet increased participation has not necessarily resulted in increased influence. This article, drawing on a four-year ethnographic study of redevelopment politics in Boston, presents an explanation for the decoupling of participation from the promise of democratic decision-making. I find that poor urban residents gain the appearance of power and status by invoking and policing membership in "the community"-a boundary sometimes, though not always, implicitly defined by race. But this appearance of power is largely an illusion. In public meetings, government officials can reinforce their authority and disempower residents by exploiting the fact that the boundary demarcating "the community" lacks a standardized definition. When officials laud "the community" as an abstract ideal rather than a specific group of people, they reduce "the community process" to a bureaucratic procedure. Residents appear empowered, while officials retain ultimate decision-making authority. I use the tools of cultural sociology to make sense of these findings and conclude with implications for the study of participatory governance and urban inequality.

   GROWTH
AB Automobile travel is a major contributor to US greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing car travel could slow climate change, but this goal is made difficult by the constellation of economic, political, cultural, and infrastructural forces that form a mutually reinforcing "system of automobility." This complexity suggests the need for an approach that attends to both the reciprocal relationship between infrastructure and practice and the moderating influence of cultural factors, but policies to encourage sustainable practices rely on asocial conceptions of behavior. With longitudinal data on bicycle-commuting in sixty-two large US cities from 2000 to 2014, I use fixed-effects regression and structural equation modeling to perform two strong tests of whether the expansion of bikeway facilities induces more bicycling, and whether this effect depends on the strength of environmentalism in a city. I also use structural equation modeling to perform a preliminary test of the reverse causal effect-whether bicycle-commuting can spur bikeway creation, again allowing for a moderating effect of environmentalism. My results add to existing evidence that bikeways induce bicycling, and provide preliminary support for the reverse effect, but also indicate that both effects are moderated by local environmentalism. Implications for the persistence of auto-dominance are discussed.

AB Research on violence in US prisons frequently finds higher rates of violence among ethnic minorities compared to whites. Explanations focus on a "subculture of violence," sometimes referred to as an honor culture or code of the street, whereby minorities import a deeply internalized, violent subculture into prison. Subcultural theories of violence have been challenged by scholarship that views culture as providing a "toolkit" of frames and scripts that individuals draw upon in different social contexts. According to this model, the importation of violence is far from inevitable, because violence results from the interplay between social context and cultural toolkits. We assess the ability of these two cultural models to explain ethnic differences in prison violence in a different national context by comparing rates of violence among Arab Muslim and Jewish criminal prisoners in Israel. Subcultural models lead us to expect higher rates of violence among Arab Muslim prisoners, while a toolkit-based explanation that draws on social identity research predicts lower rates of violence. We test these hypotheses using both logistic regression and propensity score matching on data covering over 16,000 prisoners, supplemented by in-depth interviews with prisoners and staff. Our results conflict with the expectations of subcultural theories and lend support to culture-as-toolkit explanations. We conclude by discussing the relevance of our findings for research on prison violence, theories of the relationship between culture and violence, and the usefulness of incorporating social identity into toolkit theory.

AB Residential mobility is often implicated as a risk factor for delinquency. While many scholars attribute this to causal processes spurred by moving, recent research suggests that much of the relationship is due to differences between mobile and non-mobile adolescents. However, studies in this area often operationalize mobility as a single move, limiting researchers to comparing outcomes between mobile and non-mobile adolescents. This approach is rather broad, considering heterogeneity in mobility frequency as well as variation in sending and receiving neighborhood characteristics. We propose a more nuanced framework to help anticipate how characteristics of mobility experiences may mitigate, exacerbate, or fail to influence adolescent behavior. Drawing on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) and the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 (NLSY97), we demonstrate that "hypermobility" has detrimental behavioral consequences, increases in neighborhood disadvantage between sending and receiving neighborhoods are associated with reductions in self-reported offending, and long-distance moves reduce delinquency,but only among adolescents with prior behavioral problems. These results underscore the complex association between residential mobility and delinquency during adolescence.

TI The Origins of the Food Desert: Urban Inequality as Infrastructural
   Exclusion
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID CITIES; ACCESS
AB This article develops the concept of infrastructural exclusion as a form of urban inequality through the case of the origins of the food desert in Philadelphia. Infrastructural exclusion refers to the reorganization of spatial and material interdependence into a semi-autonomous and path-dependent force that separates resources from those reliant on them. Building on archival research, it emphasizes how social problems arise out of taken-for-granted relationships between urban development, population settlements, and distribution systems. Grocery chains were interdependent with urban neighborhoods in the early 1900s, but they came to participate in a fiercely competitive industry during a precarious period of urban decline, suburban growth, and changes in transportation systems. New industry conventions about profitability, involving higher-volume supplies and lower transaction costs, became embedded into the sociotechnical infrastructure. The reorganization of infrastructural interdependence as a semi-autonomous force constrained local business decision-making, led to high rates of financial insolvency, and contributed to the overall decline of urban grocery markets. This approach to infrastructural exclusion provides insights into the causes of a unique form of urban inequality.

DT Article
ID MODERNIZATION; REVOLUTION; VALUES
AB This article builds on research demonstrating that high levels of economic and physical security are conducive to a shift from materialist to postmaterialist values-and that this shift tends to make people more favorable to important social changes. This article updates this research, demonstrating that: (1) These value changes occur with exceptionally large time lags between the onset of the conditions conducive to them, and the societal changes they produce-as previous work implies but does not demonstrate. The evidence suggests that there was a time lag of forty to fifty years between when Western societies first attained high levels of economic and physical security after World War II, and related societal changes such as legalization of same-sex marriage. (2) A distinctive set of "individual-choice norms," dealing with acceptance of gender equality, divorce, abortion, and homosexuality, is moving on a different trajectory from other cultural changes. These norms are closely linked with human fertility rates and require severe self-repression. (3) Although basic values normally change at the pace of intergenerational population replacement, the shift from pro-fertility norms to individual-choice norms is now moving much faster, having reached a tipping point where conformist pressures have reversed polarity and are now accelerating changes they once resisted. We test these claims against data from eighty countries containing most of the world's population, surveyed from 1981 to 2014.

AB This article poses a framework for considering the social processes that drive masculinity's enaction, including men's presentation of gender, masculinity's intersituational flexibility, and the persistence of gender inequality. I draw on ethnographic observation and in-depth interviews conducted in a small cockfighting community in Hawaii. On the surface, my findings are surprisingly counter-Geertzian: within Hawaiian cockfighting's uncontestedly masculine and almost exclusively male context, fighters carry out behaviors they consider "feminine" in other areas of their lives, such as caretaking, nurturing, and overt emotional expression. I draw on existing theoretical frameworks, including hybrid masculinities, to use Hawaiian cockfighting as a vehicle for elaborating our understanding of the sociology of masculinity. I argue that rather than approximating an archetypal masculinity, "ideal" masculine performance incorporates a balance of masculinized and feminized traits. This tempered incarnation of masculinity is enacted in particular localized contexts to deliberately fall "short" of archetypal masculinity. I introduce the term "masculine undercompensation" to describe the mechanism through which subordinate masculinities are incorporated to create a tempered, locally contingent masculine performance. The processes I identify strengthen and contextualize the growing literature documenting how hybridization can contribute to the maintenance of unequal gender relations.

AB We analyzed a random sample of individual listings from an online market for peer-to-peer lending to examine the effects of gender and attractiveness on receiving loans. In this setting, we tested the theoretical argument that women are penalized for violating beliefs about women's social roles when they seek loans for male-typed endeavors, such as running a business. Consistent with this theory, female borrowers seeking loans for business purposes were less likely to receive funding. Surprisingly, women's facial attractiveness moderated this effect: women seeking business loans were even less likely to receive funding if they were attractive. This result qualifies the conventional notion of beauty as a diffuse asset and underscores the alternative idea that beauty may accentuate perceived femininity and thus exacerbate the disadvantages that women face in male-typed domains. Overall, our research shows that gender beliefs about task-relevant competence can carry over from more formalized organizational contexts into new forms of online transactions that are designed to reduce biases that result from face-to-face interactions.

AB Job mobility offers opportunities for workers to obtain wage increases, but the returns on job changes differ considerably. We argue that part of this inequality results from a trade-off between occupational and regional mobility. Both mobility types offer alternative strategies for improving one's labor market position; however, each type also has unique restrictions. The high costs of regional mobility can thus induce occupational changes, even though the resulting human-capital devaluation leads to lower wage increases. We use linked retrospective life-course data for Germany (ALWA-ADIAB) and apply competing risks models to show that restrictions on one type of mobility drive individuals toward the other type of mobility. Using fixed-effects regressions, we then show that regional mobility yields higher wage improvements than occupational mobility does. We argue that restrictions on both types of mobility thus not only determine which type of mobility is chosen, thereby helping explain differential careers, but also contribute to inequality in wage trajectories due to differential returns on job mobility. The trade-off has explanatory power for the inequality between certain actors with different sets of mobility restrictions, such as parents and non-parents or employees in jobs with different skill demands, and it may also contribute to our better understanding of broader patterns of inequality-for instance, that caused by between-nation differences in job mobility.

AB Some previous studies of the relationship between women's labor force participation and household income inequality indicate that the promotion of the former has an equalizing effect on the latter; other studies insist that the promotion of women's labor force participation has a widening effect on household income inequality by way of the tendency toward assortative marriage. Hence, the relationship between women's labor force participation and household income inequality is unclear in the literature. This study aims to clarify the mechanism through which the interaction between household income and marriage produces social inequality by using mathematical and simulation-based approaches. The presented findings suggest that the promotion of women's labor force participation has a temporary widening effect on household income inequality, but an attenuating effect in the long run. They also state that assortative marriage itself has no widening effect on household income inequality, but rather an accelerating effect on widening inequality. Finally, by applying the model of that mechanism to Japan, I examine changes in household income inequality in that country.

AB A mid the long decline of US unions, research on union wage effects has struggled with selection problems and inadequate theory. I draw on the sociology of labor to argue that unions use non-market sources of power to pressure companies into raising wages. This theory of union power implies a new test of union wage effects: does union activism have an effect on wages that is not reducible to workers' market position? Two institutional determinants of union activity are used to empirically isolate the wage effect of union activism from labor market conditions: increased union revenue from investment shocks and increased union activity leading up to union officer elections. Instrumental variable analysis of panel data from the Department of Labor shows that a 1 percent increase in union spending increases a proxy for union members' wages between 0.15 percent and 0.30 percent. These wage effects are larger in years of active collective bargaining, and when unions increase spending in ways that could pressure companies. The results indicate that non-market sources of union power can affect workers' wages and that even in a period of labor weakness unions still play a role in setting wages for their members.

ID INCOME INEQUALITY; VARIABLE SELECTION; OWNERSHIP; AUTHORITY
AB Recent critiques of class analysis variously argue that aggregate class differences in life conditions and political attitudes have either declined to the point of irrelevance or decomposed into differences based on highly disaggregate occupations. This study empirically evaluates these arguments as they relate specifically to aggregate classes defined in terms of workplace ownership and authority relations, which are conceived to be distinct from both aggregate and disaggregate occupational classes based on the technical division of labor. A number of findings suggest that both the death and decomposition of class perspectives are in need of reconsideration or refinement. First, aggregate classes based on workplace ownership and authority cannot be conveniently disaggregated into smaller occupational classes based on the technical division of labor. Second, aggregate ownership-and-authority class differences in life conditions and political attitudes are statistically significant and substantively large across a wide variety of measures, and these differences are present even within disaggregate occupational classes. Third, aggregate ownership-and-authority class differences in life conditions and political attitudes show no evidence of declining since the 1970s. In fact, the only significant evidence of temporal change suggests a considerable increase in income inequality between positions in the workplace ownership and authority structure. The implications of these findings for class-analytic theory and research are discussed.

AB Do economic downturns induce class conflict over tax attitudes? Previous research casts doubt on this possibility and suggests that economic change exerts a minimal influence on welfare attitudes. Yet most of this research focuses on aggregate preferences, which potentially obscures important changes taking place at the level of social class. This study uses cross-national and temporal variation in unemployment rates as an empirical point of leverage to examine how unemployment rates influence class conflict over tax attitudes. The analysis combines individual-level data on tax attitudes (from different modules of the International Social Survey Programme) with country-level data on unemployment rates (from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to create a dataset with information on both individuals' tax attitudes and larger unemployment rates. Findings from two-way fixed-effects logistic regression models indicate that rising unemployment induces class-based change in tax attitudes. High-level professionals and managers respond to rising unemployment by withdrawing support for raising tax progressivity. By contrast, manual workers (along with low-level professionals and managers) respond to rising unemployment by increasing their support for tax progressivity. The results are observed across two different data sources. The study suggests that economic changes can foster class polarization in political attitudes.

   EQUALIZER; OPPORTUNITY; SELECTION; EXPANSION; EDUCATION
AB Stratification researchers have reported that the relationship between family background and socio-economic outcomes drops to near zero for individuals who have a baccalaureate degree, leading one scholar to conclude that "This. provides a new answer to the old question about overcoming disadvantaged origins. A college degree can do it." We present contrary evidence from two nationally representative samples of college graduates: the Baccalaureate & Beyond Longitudinal Study of 1993 and 2008. There are substantial income differences between graduates from different family backgrounds that can be observed both four and 10 years after graduation. These class-related gaps persist after controlling for college selectivity, major, and academic performance. Further analyses also indicate that these disadvantages in the labor market can be partially explained by inequalities established within occupational niches. We develop the implications of this for theories about the educational dimensions of intergenerational mobility.

AB There is long-standing concern about the mechanisms that lead to differential accumulation of retirement resources. As defined contribution (DC) plans have become the most common employer pension for US workers over recent decades, economic resources later in life increasingly depend on participating in voluntary, contributory pension instruments during working life. Using the Survey of Income and Program Participation linked to W-2 tax records containing respondents' annual contributions to DC retirement plans, we examine how participation in and contributions to DC plans among eligible US workers differ by education. Our analysis clarifies two central pathways associated with educational disparities in DC retirement plans. First, we disentangle the effects of education that operate via a labor market pathway, showing that a worker's earnings level is, by far, the most influential labor market factor associated with participation and contribution amounts. Second, we show an important independent effect of education on not only the decision to participate, but also how much money to set aside when participating, net of earnings and structural position in labor markets. Supplementary analyses using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances corroborate the importance of non-labor-market mechanisms for understanding the education gap in workplace retirement savings plans. Together, our results bring to center stage the importance of education in the process of stratification in retirement wealth formation and long-term financial security. Less educated workers face multiple disadvantages in the accumulation of retirement resources in the context of growing income inequality and changing employment institutions.

AB The positive link between marriage and health has frequently been analyzed and typically been interpreted in terms of health protection. Recently, the benefits of marriage have been criticized by sociologists who emphasize the strength of single persons in societies where being single is fully institutionalized. This paper reviews the evidence and addresses a number of unresolved issues in the literature, using recent annual panel data over a 16-year period from Switzerland. The findings cast doubts about the theory of health protection. The impact of "loss" (divorce) is about three times stronger than the impact of "gain" (marriage entry), and the effects of gain are often very small. Moreover, after marriage entry and after marriage exit, there is adjustment rather than accumulation. Especially after divorce, we find substantial recovery over the years. Finally, the results are highly sensitive to the outcome studied. Effects are strongest for life satisfaction, weak for mental health, and almost absent for two concrete health measures. We speculate that marriage is primarily linked to a more positive evaluation of one's life rather than to better health.

AB The high rate of obesity among adolescents is a global public health problem that has recently expanded to affect middle-and low-income countries. Brazil, which is undergoing a relatively rapid nutrition transition and has inadequate health systems, is currently experiencing the consequences of increasing rates of overweight and obesity concomitantly with the consequences of generations of malnourishment. Given this scenario, Brazil is an ideal context for examining the relationship between family socioeconomic status (SES) and adolescent body mass, as well as how this relationship varies across very different regions within the same country and across the body mass index (BMI) continuum. Guided by a framework that integrates nutrition transition and fundamental cause theories, we use unique nationally representative data with measured height and weight for all household members to conduct quantile regression models. The results suggest that family socioeconomic conditions are important theoretical factors associated with adolescent BMI, but that the way in which family SES impinges on adolescent BMI varies across regions characterized by different locations in the nutrition transition and varying levels of economic development. We also find that family socioeconomic disadvantages operate very differently according to BMI status. The results show that the socioeconomic gradient of adolescent BMI varies by stages of the nutrition transition and economic development and across BMI percentiles.

AB Why do certain protests prompt more intervention from the police? And why does the intensity of intervention vary over time? Drawing on analytical approaches in the protest policing literature, and on studies investigating the relationship between civil conflict, public opinion, and state repression, this study examines whether pro-Kurdish events in Turkey are treated more severely than others, and how the policing of these protests changes over time. Based on an original dataset, we analyze more than 10,000 protest events that took place in Turkey between 2000 and 2009. Our findings suggest that compared to others, pro-Kurdish events are more likely to encounter police action, one that particularly involves repressive strategies. We further show that repressive policing in pro-Kurdish events is more pronounced when the Kurdish armed insurgency against the state intensifies. Given that this is the first systematic quantitative study on protest policing in Turkey, it not only tests previously confirmed theories of protest policing, but also makes a theoretical contribution by providing a dynamic notion of threat beyond its situational forms, which builds on the conflict between the Turkish state and the PKK.

AB Group-based microcredit has become a globally adopted anti-poverty intervention. An important institutional variant of this is the self-help group (SHG) model, where non-commercialized lending is done through neighborhood-based savings and lending associations. We examine the effect of women's participation in SHGs in India on their social networks and social capital. We use household survey data, including rich social network information from seventy-five villages in rural Karnataka. In a context where women's interactions are largely restricted to their kinship networks and heavily constrained by rural life and patriarchal norms, participation in SHGs provides opportunities for socially isolated women to form new relationships. Descriptive analyses show that SHG participants, despite being more socioeconomically disadvantaged than non-participants, have significantly more incoming ties from nonkin than both non-participant women and men. After using propensity score matching to model selection into microcredit associations, we find consistent evidence that SHG participants have significantly more ties from nonkin and that these ties originate from other participants. We conclude that relationships formed within SHGs extend beyond the group and constitute important social capital, as women form friendships, give each other advice, and exchange vital basic needs resources.

TI International Organizations as Mobilizing Structures: World CSR
   Associations and Their Disparate Impacts on Members' CSR Practices,

AB International organizations are key players in globalization, but not all international organizations influence global processes in the same ways. In this paper, we argue that differences in international organizations' mobilizing structures can shape the extent to which these organizations can positively impact the practices of their members. We present the first comparative and quantitative assessment of world corporate social responsibility (CSR) associations that comprise business participants that act collectively to address pressing social and environmental concerns. We conduct time-series panel regression analyses of a unique dataset of business participation in three core world CSR associations and test their effects on business adoption of three major CSR frameworks and business performance across six major CSR evaluation schemes. Our findings reveal that world CSR associations with participatory structures, compared to those with honorific or convocational structures, more consistently encourage member businesses to adopt CSR policies and to achieve highly evaluated CSR practices. We discuss these results in relation to sociological and world society perspectives on international organizations as well as implications for future research on global corporate responsibility.

TI Seeing is (Not) Believing: How Viewing Pornography Shapes the Religious
   Lives of Young Americans
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English

   SELF-CONTROL; DRUG-USE; CONTEXT; IMPACT; ADOLESCENTS; BEHAVIOR; MODEL
AB Pornography has become increasingly accessible in the United States, and particularly for younger Americans. While some research considers how pornography use affects the sexual and psychological health of adolescents and emerging adults, sociologists have given little attention to how viewing pornography may shape young Americans' connection to key social and cultural institutions, like religion. This article examines whether viewing pornography may actually have a secularizing effect, reducing young Americans' personal religiosity over time. To test for this, we use data from three waves of the National Study of Youth and Religion. Fixed-effects regression models show that more frequent pornography viewing diminishes religious service attendance, importance of religious faith, prayer frequency, and perceived closeness to God, while increasing religious doubts. These effects hold regardless of gender. The effects of viewing pornography on importance of faith, closeness to God, and religious doubts are stronger for teenagers compared to emerging adults. In light of the rapidly growing availability and acceptance of pornography for young Americans, our findings suggest that scholars must consider how increasingly pervasive pornography consumption may shape both the religious lives of young adults and also the future landscape of American religion more broadly.

TI De Facto Privatization and Inequalities in Educational Opportunity in
   the Transition to Secondary School in Rural Malawi
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article

   EXPANSION; COUNTRIES; POLICIES; CHOICE; ACCESS; REFORM
AB There has been a recent, rapid de facto privatization of education in many African countries, as the number of private secondary schools operating in the region has grown. The majority of these schools are "low-cost" private schools where tuition and fees are set as low as possible to cover operating costs and still generate profit. Proponents of low-cost private schools argue that these schools have proliferated in impoverished areas to meet unmet demand for access to education and where private schools may offer better quality than locally available public schools. Theories of inequality of educational opportunity suggest that if private schools offer better-quality education, students from more advantaged families will be more likely to enroll at these institutions, potentially exacerbating educational inequality in the region. This analysis uses data from a school-based longitudinal survey, the Malawi Schooling and Adolescent Study, to examine socio-economic inequalities in the transition to secondary school and on-time enrollment in upper secondary. My findings indicate that youth from non-poor households are not only more likely to enroll in secondary school than poor youth, but they are also more likely to substitute enrollment in private schools for enrollment in second-tier government schools. Enrollment at private schools, however, does not yield schooling advantages; relative to both tiers of government secondary schooling, students who initially enrolled at private schools were the least likely to enroll on time in upper secondary school. These patterns suggest that these schooling circumstances may yield less segregation of opportunity than might otherwise be assumed.

AB What happens to the historic nationalizing purpose of schooling in an era of pervasive globalization? We address this question by examining patterns and predictors of nationalist emphases in 576 secondary school social science textbooks from 78 countries published between 1955 and 2011. Our descriptive and multilevel analyses show that nationalist narratives in textbooks persist into the recent globalization era and on average are not diminished in countries that are more economically, politically, or socially globalized. However, countries that occupy a dominant position in world society-either through Western cultural status or deeper embeddedness in international non-governmental organizations (INGOs)-tend to display lower levels of nationalism in their textbooks. Our examination contributes to the sociology of education by highlighting that the relationship between the global and the national is not a zero sum game: even in our globalized world, nationalist educational narratives are alive and well. We further contribute to the world society perspective by highlighting a tension between recent world cultural shifts toward individual rights and cosmopolitanism and the continued centrality of the nation-state model in world society. Our results suggest that attenuation of nationalist celebrations in schooling may be easiest for globally dominant countries whose legitimacy as nation-states is not in question.

AB Despite prominent and compelling theoretical arguments linking manufacturing imports from the global South to rising income inequality in the global North, the literature has produced decidedly mixed support for such arguments. We explain this mixed support by introducing intervening processes at the global and national levels. At the global level, evolving characteristics of global production networks (GPNs) amplify the effect of Southern imports. At the national level, wage coordination and welfare state generosity counteract the mechanisms by which Southern imports increase inequality, and thereby mitigate their effects. We conduct a time-series cross-section regression analyses of income inequality among eighteen advanced capitalist countries to test these propositions. Our analysis addresses alternative explanations, as well as validity threats related to model specification, sample composition, and measurement. We find substantial variation in the effect of Southern imports across global and national contexts. Southern imports have no systematic effect on income inequality until the magnitude of GPN activity surpasses its world-historical average, or in states with above-average levels of wage coordination and welfare state generosity. With counterfactual analyses, we show that Southern imports would have led to much different inequality trajectories in the North if there were fewer GPNs, and if the prevailing degrees of wage coordination and welfare state generosity were higher. The countervailing effects of GPNs and institutional context call for theories of inequality at the intersection of the global and the national, and raise important questions about distributional politics in the years to come.

AB Despite sustained attention, scholars disagree about the relationship between country-level affluence and the environmental concern of mass publics. While many studies assume this relationship to be uniform, we argue that it is reasonable to expect meaningful variation in the association between country-level affluence and concern across countries with different levels of wealth. We place this idea at the center of our analyses. To do so, we assess public willingness to pay for environmental protection using five waves of World Values Survey data, examining 101 country-years nested in forty-two countries spanning nineteen years. Results from mixed-effects logistic and linear regression models reveal substantial heterogeneity in the association between environmental concern and country-level affluence. We find that growth in affluence over time associates with higher mass environmental concern, but only among less affluent countries. In contrast, countries that are on average more affluent tend to have lower environmental concern, but again, this relationship is primarily concentrated among less affluent countries. Although a variety of theories can be usefully applied to particular relationships occurring along the range of affluence, we argue that degradation theories go far in explaining the heterogeneous associations uncovered between environmental concern and country-level affluence. That associations are largely concentrated among less affluent countries has implications for the understanding of environmental concern in wealthy countries and the development of policy to address environmental reform. These issues are discussed in the conclusion.

AB Genre assignments help audiences make sense of new releases. Studies from a wide range of market contexts have shown that generalists defying clear mapping to established categories suffer penalties in market legitimacy, perceived quality, or audience attention. We introduce an empirical strategy to disentangle two mechanisms, reduced niche fitness and audience confusion, causing devaluation or ignorance of boundary-crossing offers. Our data on 2,971 feature films released to US theaters and subsequently made available on DVD further reveal that consequences of category spanning are subject to strong moderating influences. Negative effects are far from universal, manifesting only if (a) combined genres are culturally distant, (b) products are released to a stable and highly institutionalized market context, and (c) offers lack familiarity as an alternative source of market recognition. Our study provides ramifications as to the scope conditions of categorization effects and modifies some widely acknowledged truisms regarding boundary crossing in cultural markets.

AB Whether employment life courses have become more unstable and complex across the twentieth century has been a prominent topic in academic and public debate. Yet, empirical evidence on longer-term employment trajectories and how they changed across cohorts beyond single-country analyses is sparse. In this paper, we propose a new methodological approach that includes measures developed in sequence analysis to summarize complexity in employment trajectories in a cross-classified multilevel model by cohort and country. This allows us to quantify and describe change in the complexity of employment trajectories across cohorts relative to variation across fourteen European countries. We use SHARELIFE data to analyze employment trajectories from age 15 to 45 for men and women born between 1918 and 1963. For these birth cohorts, findings show that change across cohorts is negligibly small, compared with a sizeable variation of complexity in employment trajectories across countries. Further, based on theoretical assumptions derived from the varieties of capitalism literature, we demonstrate that the cross-national variation in employment complexity can, in part, be accounted for by employment protection legislation and unemployment protection measured as wage replacement rates. We conclude that in accordance with other studies, our findings contradict the commonly held belief that employment trajectories have become much more unstable across the second half of the twentieth century. More generally, the proposed methodological approach is also promising to analyze complexity in life course trajectories in other areas of application.

AB Why are some workers employed in some workplaces more likely to acquire valued rewards in the form of employer-provided benefits? In this paper, I shed new light on the sources of benefits inequality by developing a structural, rent-based theory as a strategy for observing and explaining within-and between-workplace benefits inequality. I put forward rent extraction by powerful workers as a main causal mechanism that produces within-workplace variation; and workplaces' rent-sharing, attributable to firms with considerable resources and formalized organizations, as a mechanism that generates between-workplace variation. I test this theoretical model and the "linkedness" of the two mechanisms by analyzing Israeli matched employer-employee register data. I find that workers with greater bargaining power for rent extraction (i.e., full-time full-year (FTFY), service-class occupations) are more likely to obtain valued benefits within workplaces. Also large-scale, large-size firms and formalized workplaces (i.e., state-owned and public organizations and older organizations) are more likely to share their rent by providing valued benefits to all their workers, FTFY workers and service-class employees in particular. I conclude that benefits exacerbate the disparities arising from wages-except for women, who have higher odds of obtaining valued benefits than comparable men; implicitly, women have an unmeasured preference for benefits.

AB Research shows that receiving loans, family contributions, and grants has implications for students both during and after college, but one key outcome has been overlooked: fields of study. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-1997 cohort (NLSY-97), this study is the first to assess how college funding is associated with first-term majors and course selection throughout college. I posit that funding sources effectively constrain students' fields of study, such that students choose majors and courses that align with their broader financial circumstances. As funding from loans increases, students are more likely to major in applied non-STEM fields (e.g., business, nursing) and less likely to be undeclared during the first term-particularly if students are from low-or middle-income families. Conversely, as funding from family contributions increases, students are more likely to be undeclared and less likely to major or take courses in applied non-STEM fields. Receiving grants bears little relation to students' major or course fields. These patterns suggest that funding sources entail distinct costs and benefits that may influence college student decision-making, and that fields of study are the product of multiple sources of inequality.

TI The Role of Education for Intergenerational Income Mobility: A
   comparison of the United States, Great Britain, and Sweden
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL-MOBILITY; CLASS-ORIGIN; INEQUALITY; ASSOCIATION; PERSISTENCE
AB Previous studies have found that intergenerational income persistence is relatively high in the United States and Britain, especially as compared to Nordic countries. We compare the association between family income and sons' earnings in the United States (National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979), Britain (British Cohort Study 1970), and Sweden (Population Register Data, 1965 cohort), and find that both income elasticities and rank-order correlations are highest in the United States, followed by Britain, with Sweden being clearly more equal. We ask whether differences in educational inequality and in return to qualifications can explain these cross-country differences. Surprisingly, we find that this is not the case, even though returns to education are higher in the United States. Instead, the low income mobility in the United States and Britain is almost entirely due to the part of the parent-son association that is not mediated by educational attainment. In the United States and especially Britain, parental income is far more important for earnings at a given level of education than in Sweden, a result that holds also when controlling for cognitive ability. This goes against widespread ideas of the United States as a country where the role of ascription is limited and meritocratic stratification prevails.

TI Globalization and Contemporary Fertility Convergence
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; POPULATION-POLICY; DIFFUSION; TRANSITION;
   DEMOCRACY; ACCOUNT; SPREAD
AB The rise of the global network of nation-states has precipitated social transformations throughout the world. This article examines the role of political and economic globalization in driving fertility convergence across countries between 1965 and 2009. While past research has typically conceptualized fertility change as a country-level process, this study instead employs a theoretical and methodological framework that examines differences in fertility between pairs of countries over time. Convergence in fertility between pairs of countries is hypothesized to result from increased cross-country connectedness and cross-national transmission of fertility-related schemas. I investigate the impact of various cross-country ties, including ties through bilateral trade, intergovernmental organizations, and regional trade blocs, on fertility convergence. I find that globalization acts as a form of social interaction to produce fertility convergence. There is significant heterogeneity in the effects of different cross-country ties. In particular, trade with rich model countries, joint participation in the UN and UNESCO, and joining a free trade agreement all contribute to fertility convergence between countries. Whereas the prevailing focus in fertility research has been on factors producing fertility declines, this analysis highlights specific mechanisms-trade and connectedness through organizations-leading to greater similarity in fertility across countries. Globalization is a process that propels the spread of culturally laden goods and schemas impinging on fertility, which in turn produces fertility convergence.

   PENALTY; MARRIAGE; FAMILY; INTERMARRIAGE; MOTHERHOOD; PATTERNS; SPOUSES
AB Previous research has shown considerable marriage premiums in earnings for men, but often penalties for women of being in a union. In this study we extend this research by analyzing how the age difference between spouses affects the earnings profiles by gender. As we follow people over time in advance as well as within their marriage, we can separate premarital from postmarital earnings movements. The data consist of information on annual earnings 1990-2009 for all Swedes born 1960-1974 (N = 926,219). The results indicate that age homogamy is related to higher earnings for both men and women, and that larger age differences are generally associated with lower union premiums, quite independently of which spouse is older. However, most of these results are explained by assortative mating, in which men and women with greater earnings potentials find partners of a similar age. Overall, the age difference between spouses seems to have a limited causal effect, if any, on individual earnings.

   HOMICIDE; PROJECT; CHICAGO; DEMAND
AB Recently, scholars have argued that local social and economic institutions, such as bars and payday lenders, can influence neighborhood crime outcomes. Drawing on routine activities theory and social disorganization theory, such research has posited that such institutions can directly affect crime rates by providing potential targets or encouraging criminal behavior, and can indirectly affect crime rates by discouraging social control efforts. We draw on this literature, as well as the literature on reactions to firearm prevalence, to examine the effects of gun shops on local crime rates. Using data for the year 2000 drawn from the National Neighborhood Crime Study (NNCS), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives' Federal Firearms Licensees Database (FFLD), and the National Establishment Time-Series Longitudinal Business Database (NETS), we use hierarchical linear models to examine how the prevalence of gun shops at the tract and metro level contribute to tract-level rates of violent crime in eighty-nine large US cities. Our findings indicate that gun shop prevalence in urban areas is associated with increased rates of homicides and robberies, and that these effects are more pronounced in neighborhoods characterized by residential instability. We conclude with a discussion of policy considerations and avenues for future research on local institutions.

   POLITICS; RACE; FEAR; NEIGHBORHOOD; PERCEPTIONS
AB This study investigates whether exposure to various news sectors (local television, network television, cable television, radio, daily print newspapers, and Internet) is associated with audience members' criminal justice policy preferences, and how these relationships are moderated by audience members' socio-demographic characteristics. I propose that the relationship between news exposure and punitiveness is mediated by audience members' instrumental concerns (fear of crime and previous victimization) and expressive concerns (belief in the importance of traditional ties, feelings of racial resentment, and pessimism about the national economy). I further suggest that the relationship between news exposure and punitiveness is moderated by audience members' socio-demographic characteristics (race/ethnicity, local crime rate, and political ideology). Finally, I contend that individual news sectors vary in their attention to crime and their rhetorical framing, and thus have differing relationships with punitiveness. Results of a nationally representative survey suggest that news exposure cultivates punitiveness among whites, but not among blacks or Hispanics. Among whites, local news viewership has a significant positive relationship with punitiveness, particularly among individuals living in low-crime areas. Cable television, radio, print newspaper, and Internet news exposure have significant relationships with punitiveness, the direction of which hinges on audience members' partisanship. I discuss the results in the context of the social construction of reality, highlighting the interplay between experienced and vicarious sources of knowledge, and in terms of selective exposure, emphasizing that audience members' news outlet choices have profound implications for their worldviews.

AB This paper introduces a historical, macro-political argument into the literature on anti-immigration sentiment, which has mainly considered individual-level predictors such as education or social capital as well as country-level factors such as fluctuations in labor market conditions, changing composition of immigration streams, or the rise of populist parties. We argue that past geopolitical competition and war have shaped how national identities formed and thus also contemporary attitudes toward newcomers: countries that have experienced more violent conflict or lost territory and sovereignty developed ethnic (rather than civic) forms of nationalism and thus show higher levels of anti-immigration sentiment today. We introduce a geopolitical threat scale and score 33 European countries based on their historical experiences. Two anti-immigration measures come from the European Social Survey. Mixed-effects, ordinal logistic regression models reveal strong statistical and substantive significance for the geopolitical threat scale. Furthermore, ethnic forms of national identification do seem to mediate this relationship between geopolitical threat and restrictionist attitudes. The main analysis is robust to a wide variety of model specifications, to the inclusion of all control variables known to affect anti-immigration attitudes, and to a series of alternative codings of the geopolitical threat scale.

TI The Network Dynamics of Status: Assimilation and Selection

ID DECISION-MAKING; SOCIAL NETWORKS; POWER; ORGANIZATIONS; FRIENDSHIP;
   MARKET; MODEL; PEER
AB Using longitudinal data that we have collected on friendship and advice relations in a cohort of MBA students, we examine how status affects the dynamics of network ties among peers. Estimates of Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOMs) suggest that status is a consequence of network ties because over time the level of status attributed to individual students by other students tends to the average level of status attributed to their network partners-a phenomenon we call status assimilation. Status is also an antecedent to network ties because it affects partner selection decisions, giving rise to distinct forms of social attachment. We find that both network-based processes of status assimilation, as well as status-based processes of social selection, are present, but they vary subtly yet significantly across network domains. Students tend to the average level of status of their friends, but not to that of their advisors. High-status students are more active in the friendship network, but more popular in the advice network. We find evidence of performance homophily rather than status homophily: students with similar grades are more likely to exchange friendship and advice ties. High-status students tend to be more central in the advice network, but status attributions spill over through friendship, rather than advice relations. The study documents how the relation between social status and social networks varies both over time, as well as across network domains. The study also demonstrates the importance of accounting for multiplexity-the tendency of a network to operate through another.

AB How is the delinquent behavior of adolescents influenced by their peers? Previous studies in criminology have primarily focused on the effects of friendship networks on delinquency, but what is less examined is the influence of weaker and often negligible relationships on behavior. In this paper, we explore the effect of familiar others, namely those socio-demographically similar peers who are not connected through friendships, on the behavioral diffusion of smoking among adolescents. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we show that, even after controlling for the behavior of friends, the smoking behavior of familiar others has a significant longitudinal effect on adolescents' likelihood of smoking tobacco and marijuana. The results have important implications for expanding our understanding of the social diffusion of adolescent behavior through contextual mechanisms.

AB Educational gradients in health status, morbidity, and mortality are well established, but which aspects of schooling produce those gradients is only partially understood. We draw on newly available data from the midlife follow-up of the High School and Beyond sophomore cohort to analyze the relationship between students' level of coursework in high school and their long-term health outcomes. We additionally evaluate the mediating roles of skill development, postsecondary attendance and degree attainment, and occupational characteristics. We find that students who took a medium- to high-level course of study in high school have better self-reported health and physical functioning in midlife, even net of family background, adolescent health, baseline skills, and school characteristics. The association partially operates through pathways into postsecondary education. Our findings have implications for both educational policy and research on the educational gradient in health.

TI Income Inequality and Household Labor
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID HOUSEWORK TIME; EARNINGS; DIVISION; SERVICES; HELP
AB Income inequality has increased dramatically in the United States since the mid-1970s. This remarkable change in the distribution of household income has spurred a great deal of research on the social and economic consequences of exposure to high inequality. However, the empirical record on the effects of income inequality is mixed. In this paper, we suggest that previous research has generally overlooked a simple but important pathway through which inequality might manifest in daily life: inequality shapes the ability of women to outsource domestic labor by hiring others to perform it. One important venue where such dynamics might then manifest is in time spent on housework, and in particular in the time divide in housework between women of high and low socio-economic status. We combine micro-data from the 2003-2013 American Time Use Survey with area-level data on income inequality to show that the class divide in housework time between women with a college degree and from high-earning households and women of lower socio-economic status is wider in more unequal places. We further assess whether this gap can be explained by domestic outsourcing by combining micro-data from the 2003-2013 Consumer Expenditure Survey with area-level data on income inequality and show that the gap in spending for household services between households of high and low socio-economic status also increases in contexts of higher inequality.

   TRANSACTIONS; NETWORKS; PAYMENTS; BUSINESS; SECTOR
AB To supplement funding and strengthen relationships with the community, police departments often accept donations from individuals and businesses. These donations are a form of disreputable exchange: they are permitted but laden with the potential for controversy. Gift-giving is generally forbidden in public agencies because it conflicts with bureaucratic organizational principles of impersonality and fairness and equality before the law. Accepting donations, therefore, requires mechanisms to purify them, ensuring that there is no reciprocity, while at the same time motivating and acknowledging the bond with donors. In this paper, we analyze the management strategies established by a police department in Canada to maintain and encourage donations while preventing reciprocity and minimizing the possibility that gifts are interpreted as bribes. We identify four management strategies: institutional separation via recognized charity organizations; denial of reciprocity; limits on donation use; and screening the giver.

   in Academia

DT Article

   SPECIALIZATION; EMPLOYMENT; SOCIOLOGY; SCIENCE
AB In academia, there remains a gender gap in promotion to tenure, such that men are more likely to receive tenure than women. This paper tests three explanations of this gender gap in promotion: (1) contextual and organizational differences across departments; (2) performance/productivity differences by gender; and (3) gendered inequality in evaluation. To test these explanations, this project uses a novel dataset drawing from a sample of assistant professors in Sociology, Computer Science, and English, across research universities. This dataset combines data from sources including curriculum vitae, Google Scholar, and web archive employment data, resulting in a dataset of assistant professors' publication records, department affiliations, and job positions. Analyses examine the gender gap in the likelihood of promotion to tenure and in early career trajectories, while accounting for publication productivity and department/university context. The results demonstrate that productivity measures account for a portion of the gender gap in tenure, but in each discipline a substantial share of the gender gap remains unexplained by these factors. Department characteristics do not explain the tenure gender gap. Further, when women do receive tenure, they do so in lower-prestige departments than men, on average. These findings suggest that gendered inequality in the tenure evaluation process contributes to the gender gap in tenure rates.

Industries whose products depend primarily on the manipulation of symbolic media were the most likely to recruit from elite colleges. By contrast, industries involved in the transformation of the material world recruited less often from elite colleges, and this was particularly true for industries that employed comparatively few workers with advanced degrees. We find a relatively low level of association between elite undergraduate origins and executive positions in economy and state but greater proportional concentration by graduate business or law school attended. We discuss the different selection criteria used by elite colleges looking for outstanding students and corporations looking for outstanding executives, as well as additional layers of affinity that may lie behind industry differences in recruitment to executive positions.

AB Previous research on birth order has consistently shown that later-borns have lower educational attainment than first-borns; however, it is not known whether there are birth order patterns in college major. Given evidence that parents disproportionately invest in first-born children, there are likely to be birth order patterns attributable to differences in both opportunities and preferences, related to ability, human capital specialization through parent-child transfers of knowledge, and personality. Birth order patterns in college major specialization may shed light on these explanatory mechanisms and may also account for long-term birth order differences in educational and labour market outcomes. Using Swedish population register data and sibling fixed effects, we find large birth order differences in university applications. First-borns are more likely to apply to, and graduate from, medicine and engineering programs at university, while later-borns are more likely to study journalism and business programs, and to attend art school. We also find that these birth order patterns are stronger in high-socioeconomic status families and that differences in college major explain approximately half of the within-family birth order differences in long-term earnings. These results indicate that early life experiences and parental investment shape sibling differences in ability, preferences, and ambitions even within the shared environment of the family.

AB College selectivity is associated with numerous positive life outcomes, but research on the antecedents of college selectivity, including religion, is limited-despite a long tradition of religion and stratification research. Using survey data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 2,093) and semi-structured interviews from the National Study of Youth and Religion (N = 46), we test for and explain differences in the college selectivity of students from conservative Protestant (CP) religious backgrounds compared to others. We hypothesize that CPs attend less selective colleges than other young adults, and that this may especially be the case among women. Our quantitative findings suggest CPs do attend less selective colleges, and the difference is greater among those with better high school GPAs. However, these differences are nonexistent for men once background factors are controlled. CP women attend less selective colleges than other women-a difference that is even larger among women with higher academic ability. Our qualitative findings suggest that these differences stem from young women's different understandings of the purposes of college (general self-betterment versus human capital investment), which relate to unique strategies for balancing work and family, enacting altruism, and achieving self-satisfaction. These findings show the continued link between religion and stratification and, more broadly, culture and stratification.

   UNEMPLOYMENT; ASSIMILATION; INEQUALITY; ADJUSTMENT; CLOSURE
AB An important explanation for immigrants' wage disadvantage is that human capital acquired in the country of origin is not fully transferable to the country of destination. Credentialing theories, on the other hand, argue that being educated abroad results in lower wages because foreign degrees are weaker signals to employers and might impede formal access to occupations. In this study, we use the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies 2012 (PIAAC) data and include-besides educational degrees-measures of cognitive, non-cognitive, and job-specific skills to explain wages. In our analysis of 11 European countries, we find robust evidence that having a non-Western foreign degree is associated with lower wages. After accounting for different types of skills, the wage penalty associated with having a foreign degree remains substantial, as skills explain only a third of the place of education effect. This finding is in line with the argument that being educated abroad results in lower wages because of not only the limited transferability of skills, but also the limited transferability of degrees.

AB This study analyzes the persistence of educational inequality in advanced industrialized societies with expanding and differentiated education systems. Using Denmark as a case, we investigate changes in immobility patterns for cohorts born 1960-1981 and develop a new micro-educational classification capturing both hierarchical and horizontal forms of educational differentiation. To investigate the association between parents' and children's educational status, we apply log linear models and control for four types of educational immobility: gradational (by returns to education), aggregated (5 macro-educational levels), horizontal (19 fields of study), and disaggregated (62 micro-educations). Our findings show that while macro-educational immobility has decreased across the period, micro-educational immobility at the university and university college levels remains high and stable, in particular for sons. We also find great variation in immobility for specific micro-educations within the university level. Studies of educational immobility would therefore benefit from paying attention to micro-educational classifications, because they capture patterns of multidimensional, disaggregated forms of reproduction. In addition, the micro-educational approach far better explains the immobility of sons than it explains that of daughters, revealing important gender differences in the immobility patterns for sons and daughters.

AB Extensive scholarship addresses whether and how social movements can have consequences for outcomes of interest to them. Though divided in its conclusions, existing research generally shares a focus on potential contributions of movements to the codification of rights and adoption of policies, rather than their actual implementation. Often, however, palpable enactment of the crystallized laws and policies that movements demand is far from guaranteed, raising salient questions about whether and how movements can matter for implementation outcomes as well. To address such questions, the article uses a mixed-methods analysis to examine consequences of subnational office-holding by "sanitarista" activists from the Sanitarist Movement-contemporary Brazil's most important health movement-for rates of primary public health coverage and childhood mortality. Before reviewing existing theories and conceptualizing movement office-holding, it briefly describes the movement's role in codifying Brazil's constitutional right to health and demanding new local democratic institutions for enacting that right. Then, Prais-Winsten regression analyses of all major Brazilian capitals between 1995 and 2014 show that sanitarista office-holding atop a key subnational institution was associated with broader health service coverage and lower mortality. Comparative case-study analysis illustrates that office-holding sanitaristas helped generate these improvements by leveraging new democratic offices to marshal support of subnational executives for the movement's modest but effective state-building project in the municipal health sector. Ultimately, theories of movement consequences benefit from considering how in certain democratic contexts, subnational office-holding can constitute an important standalone outcome with considerable promise to also improve policy implementation and social development.

   LANGUAGE; WASHINGTON; DISCOURSE; PARADIGM; EVENTS
AB Despite efforts by protesters to develop newsworthy tactics, there is ample evidence that reporters use a few well-defined scripts to construct stories on these events. The institutionalization of protest has only served to amplify the routinization of media coverage. How then do reporters address emergent forms of collective action that fail to conform to existing scripts? The current research investigates this phenomenon by comparing the language used to describe protest in major American cities and disturbances on college and university campuses. Colleges and universities have seen an upsurge of these events, such as disorderly celebrations following sporting contests. In contrast, protest has become increasingly institutionalized. As a consequence, we suspected that coverage of campus community disturbances would draw much more heavily on language that portrays them as dangerous than would coverage of protests. Our analysis of newspaper coverage reveals that even when taking into consideration important event features like the behaviors of police and civilians, protests are covered in a far more routine fashion than are campus community riots, a condition that holds even for the most contentious protest events. These findings provide important insights into the interplay of collective action and media attention, and are especially timely given the recent rise of more contentious events such as the #blacklivesmatter protests.

AB Under which conditions do social movements receive coverage by the mainstream news media? News coverage matters for movements for political, cultural, and organizational reasons, but only rarely have scholars analyzed the coverage of movements comparatively and at the movement level. To address the question, we apply a political mediation model of the influence of movements to professional news media, using ideas from the social organization of the news perspective. From this model, we hypothesize four main multicausal paths to extensive coverage for movements. These involve the joint occurrence of two specific movement characteristics-disruptive capacities and extensive organization-and two specific political contexts-unified partisan regimes and enforced policies. Working from scholarship that argues that rightist movements have different determinants, we also devise hypotheses for their coverage. These hypotheses are appraised through qualitative comparative analyses on an updated Political Organizations in the News data set. The latter includes information on all the coverage of national US movement organizations in four major national newspapers across the twentieth century. These analyses provide extensive support for the mediation model and support claims that rightist movements have separate and in some ways more difficult routes to extensive news coverage.

AB Garrett Hardin's 1968 essay "The Tragedy of the Commons" famously decried the vulnerability of finite communal resources to overexploitation. Yet collective accessibility to and ownership of resources need not necessarily lead to their mismanagement or abuse; rather, the practice of sharing resources can engender positive environmental, social, economic, and political impacts. Social capital, as both the source and product of relational interactions which occur within public space, constitutes one of these benefits.
   This paper investigates the relationship between temporary communal spaces and social capital through a case study of the Commons project in Christchurch, New Zealand. Generated by both the space itself and the interactions that occur within it, the social capital created in and through the Commons has become a powerful symbol of recovery in a city recovering from disaster. Instead of the tragedy of the commons, therefore, this paper presents the story of the Commons of the tragedy and explores the ways in which social capital has been fostered in and through this space.

AB The built environment that serves as the literal foundation for social life involves not just the material development of local landscapes but ongoing damage from natural hazards endemic to these landscapes, which are forecasted to increase over coming years. Prior research has investigated each of these dynamics independently but not their intersection. The present study begins to fill this gap by combining county-level data on land development with that on natural hazard damage to assess how these two dimensions of local landscape transformation unfold together over time. Results from spatial panel regression and structural equation models indicate that on average and net of past trends and time-invariant factors, natural hazard damages tend to accelerate local land development in ways that feed back and scale up successively over time, especially onto formerly undeveloped lands. Implications for future landscape transformation and research are discussed.

AB The proliferation of cultural objects, such as music, books, film, and websites, has created a new problem: How do consumers determine the value of cultural objects in an age of information glut? Crowd-sourcing-paralleling word-of-mouth recommendations-has taken center stage, yet expert opinion has also assumed renewed importance. Prior work on the valuation of artworks and other cultural artifacts identifies ways critics establish and maintain classificatory boundaries, such as genre. We extend this research by offering a theoretical approach emphasizing the dynamics of critics' valuation and classification. Empirically, this analysis turns to Pitchfork.com, an influential music review website, to examine the relationship between classification and valuation. Using topic models of fourteen years of Pitchfork.com album reviews (n = 14,495), we model the dynamics of valuation through genre and additional factors predictive of positive reviews and cultural consecration. We use gold-record awards to study the relationship between valuation processes and commercial outcomes. Conclusions highlight the role of professional critics, alongside crowd-sourcing and other forms of criticism, in the dynamic process of valuation and encourage the continued exploration of fruitful ways to connect computational and more canonical ways of conducting sociological research.

AB Although the labor market consequences of incarceration in prison have been central to the literature on mass incarceration, punishment, and inequality, other components of the growing criminal justice system have received less attention from sociologists. In particular, the rise of mass incarceration was accompanied by an even larger increase in community supervision. In this paper, we examine the labor market effects of one frequently experienced aspect of post-prison parole, short-term custody for parole violations. Although such sanctions are viewed as an alternative to returning parole violators to prison, they have the potential to affect labor market outcomes in ways similar to imprisonment, including both adverse and positive effects on earnings. We estimate that parolees lost approximately 37 percent of their earnings in quarters during which they were in short-term custody. Although their earnings tended to increase in the quarter immediately following short-term custody-consistent with the stated intentions of such sanctions-parolees experienced further earnings loss over the longer term after such sanctions. In the third quarter following a short-term custody sanction, earnings are lowered by about 13 percent. These associations are larger for those who were employed in the formal labor market before their initial incarceration.

AB Social scientists have long recognized that college students from lower-income households have lower college completion rates than their more affluent peers who are attending the very same schools. Yet parsing the mechanisms through which relative socioeconomic disadvantage and privilege influence college completion has been difficult. This paper leverages a novel dataset comprising information from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, the Education Trust Pell Partnership, and the U.S. News and World Report to investigate the potential influence of Greek letter societies (i.e., fraternities and sororities) on gaps in completion rates between Pell Grant recipients and non-Pell, non-Stafford loan recipients. We find that at selective four-year schools, which tend to enroll students from a wide variety of class backgrounds, the presence of Greek letter societies is associated with greater class-based graduation gaps. The association is evident, but less significant, at the nation's most selective universities. Results suggest that both stratification researchers and higher education administrators should seriously consider the extra-academic features of college life as important mediators of social inequality.

AB Our understanding of cross-national differences in the relationship between social class location and voting choices has improved substantially in the last decade. Yet scholarship about cross-national and longitudinal variations in the relationship between class location and policy preferences remains neglected. This paper addresses this important gap in the literature through a comparative, longitudinal analysis of the substantial, cross-national variation of class differences in pro-redistribution attitudes. To explain this variation, we focus on the role of preexisting policies and engage with an ongoing debate in the policy feedbacks literature. The self-interest approach argues that higher redistribution creates incentives among the upper classes to oppose redistribution, widening the class cleavage. By contrast, the normative approach argues that universal social policy regimes meet the fairness criteria of middle and upper classes, thereby reducing attitudinal differences. Using an innovative data set containing 106 country-years between 1985 and 2010, our study supports the self-interest approach. Countries achieving more redistribution display larger class cleavages in pro-redistribution attitudes, while universalism does not reduce this divide. The study further shows that redistribution and class cleavage are linearly related because redistribution bolsters the already low commitment with inequality reduction in the upper service and lower service classes.

AB This paper is one of the first systematic assessments of ex-felons' workplace performance. Using FOIA-requested data from the Department of Defense, we follow 1.3 million ex-offender and non-offender enlistees in the US military from 2002 to 2009. Those with a felony background show no difference in attrition rates due to poor performance compared to those without criminal records. Moreover, exfelons are promoted more quickly and to higher ranks than other enlistees. At the same time, we find that ex-felons are slightly more likely to commit a legal offense in the military system (5 percent of non-felons compared to 6.6 percent of ex-felons). We also find a higher rate of work-related deaths among the ex-felon sample; closer evaluation of limited data suggests this may be driven by ex-felons being assigned more often to combat positions. Overall, our study shows that the military's criminal history screening process can result in successful employment outcomes for exfelons, at least in terms of job mobility and reliability, to the mutual benefit of employer and employee. An important question arising from this analysis is whether the military's "whole person" review can apply successfully to the civilian sector.

AB Return migrants engage in high rates of self-employment, which scholars commonly attribute to the accumulation of financial and human capital while working abroad. Central to this scholarship is the assumption that self- employment is positive and leads to upward economic mobility among return migrants. This scholarship is limited, however, because it relies on large surveys and cross-sectional census data that treat self-employment as a single unidimensional status measured at one point in time. To improve conceptualization and measurement of self-employment, we engage three bodies of research that have thus far had little cross-fertilization: the literature on work and self-employment in Latin America, the scholarship on return migration and self-employment, and developments in economic theories of international migration. Drawing on results from the first longitudinal analysis of the labor market trajectories of Mexican return migrants in a large urban area in central Mexico, we identify three types of self-employment-survivalist, temporary, and prosperous. To explain these divergent self-employment pathways, we draw on biographical narratives and identify two sets of mechanisms-human capital formation and life-course stage. Overall, our investigation of self-employment types suggests a complex relationship between international migration experiences and the labor market mobility of return migrants that cannot be understood without taking into consideration migrants' social and economic circumstances before, during, and after migration. Consequently, our study yields insights into economic theories of international migration and provides direction for future research on return migration and labor market reintegration.

AB The study of foreign-local encounters is at the heart of much of social scientific research, from the dynamics of globalized travel and migration to the study of colonialism and places of foreign control. These interactions are often both shaped by structural inequalities and fleeting. How do organizations shape these interactions? This question of how organizations interact with their environment is a central puzzle that motivates the field of organizational studies. Yet most research assumes that organizations are, or intend to be, permanent. What about transient organizations, those that neither have nor intend to have a permanent presence? How do these types of organizations shape foreign-local interactions? Using qualitative interviews, documents, and ethnographic observations, I argue that Goffman's work on total institutions is useful for understanding this question in cases where transient organizations are self-sustaining. Examining a US military ship and an evangelical missionary ship docked at the Subic Bay Freeport Zone, Philippines, I show how a ship's total institutional form and logics shape-or affect-foreign-local encounters in three ways, by: (1) gendering the geography of the host community, (2) perpetuating stereotypes, and (3) influencing local markets. By shifting scholarly focus from the dynamics of permanent organizations to the intended and unintended consequences of transient total institutions, I reveal how transient actors can have profound effects on social life. Given the proliferation of ships around the world, my findings have broader implications beyond the two I study.

AB For decades, educational scholars have claimed that public schools are loosely coupled organizations, but research does not fully address how schools create the coupling structure. Recent federal policies have centralized the public education system, but state laws, districts, and principals still play a prominent role in shaping the organization of schools. In this paper, I investigate how the multiple tiers of the public education system influence the coupling structures of schools. Utilizing all seven waves of the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), I rely on OLS regression to analyze how couplings emerge within schools. Findings suggest three major influences on coupling within schools. First, federal policies have had a non-linear effect on school-level coupling. Second, the relationship between the district and the school affects school-level coupling. Finally, principals play a key role in shaping the coupling within the school, and coupling is a gendered process.

AB Incarceration intensely alters the family lives of incarcerated men and the women and children connected to them. Yet women increasingly spend time behind bars and, accordingly, they absorb direct consequences of incarceration in addition to the more commonly considered spillover consequences of men's incarceration on families. In this article, we draw on the stress process perspective to examine the consequences of maternal incarceration for three broad aspects of family life: romantic relationships, parenting, and economic wellbeing. Data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 3,045), an urban sample that includes a relatively large number of mothers who spent time in jail or prison, and methodological strategies to account for spurious associations between maternal incarceration and family life, yield two important conclusions. First, maternal incarceration is a stressor that proliferates to engender chronic strains in family life. Second, many of these chronic strains are especially acute when maternal incarceration is accompanied by paternal incarceration. Taken together, these findings suggest that the stressor of maternal incarceration has reverberating consequences for family life.

AB The United States witnessed a dramatic expansion of the penal state from the 1970s to the Great Recession of 2008. One key puzzle is why penal state growth continued unabated long after crime levels peaked in the early 1990s. We focus on local policing and consider the relationship between growing city-level law enforcement expenditures and two shifts: first, the move toward an economy increasingly organized around residential real estate; and second, city-level welfare retrenchment. We argue that increasing economic reliance on housing price appreciation during the late 1990s and the 2000s heightened demand for expanded law enforcement even as actual risks of crime victimization fell. At the same time, cities increasingly addressed social problems through criminal justice-rather than social service-capacities. We assess these arguments using a dataset of 171 cities' police expenditures between 1992 and 2010. Results of a dynamic panel model indicate that places with more pronounced reliance on housing price growth and mortgage investment exhibited correspondingly greater growth of local law enforcement, as did places with decreased social service spending.

ID WOMENS EMPLOYMENT; COHABITATION; STABILITY; MOTHERS; UNIONS
AB Previous studies of maternal employment have focused on marital status differences, but the rise in nonmarital cohabiting parenthood problematizes the simple dichotomy between married and unmarried mothers. Theory and previous research yield mixed predictions as to whether cohabiting mothers' employment will more closely resemble that of married mothers or lone unmarried mothers. Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, I examine how maternal employment varies across family structures (married parents, cohabiting unmarried parents, and lone unmarried mothers) in the five years after a birth for mothers living in urban areas in the United States. Descriptive statistics show few differences in maternal employment patterns by family structure. Controlling for human capital, however, I find that cohabiting mothers return to work earlier and work more than married mothers. Cohabiting mothers and lone mothers show very similar employment patterns. Additionally, cohabiting mothers who later marry have employment trajectories that are similar to married mothers, whereas married mothers who divorce increase their employment hours. Family characteristics, partner characteristics, and gender attitudes do not explain employment differences between married and cohabiting mothers. I speculate that cohabiting mothers work more than married mothers as a hedge against economic deprivation given high union dissolution rates for cohabiting couples.

AB It remains unclear to what extent shifts in gender attitudes are products of changes in micro-level characteristics, macro-level social transformations, or net cohort and period transitions. We test these questions on 20 waves of data from the General Social Survey, 1977-2016 (N = 45,125). Compositional change in individual characteristics accounts for almost 78 percent of the cohort variation in gender attitudes, but only 32 percent of the historical transformations. Macro dynamics are responsible for an additional 60 percent of the historical change in gender attitudes. Two structural forces are associated with historical transitions in American gender attitudes: gender equality in the labor force and the rise of men's overwork. Each of these factors accounts for a significant proportion of the period variation in gender attitudes in our analysis, and the rise of men's overwork appears to account for the puzzle of the "stalled revolution" in the 1990s and its "restart" in the mid-2000s. The conservative swing in 1994-2004 correlates with the rise of overwork, as the proportion of men who overwork soared during this period when traditional gender roles were reinforced.

AB Twenty-five years after the fall of the communist regimes, the gender gap in employment varies widely across Central and Eastern Europe. This study examines the societal-level reasons for this variation and assesses the impact of different dimensions of neoliberally minded "economic development" strategies on gender inequality. We focus on Central and Eastern Europe, a segment of the world not typically addressed in the literature on gender and development. We rely on the 2008 and 2012 waves of the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey as well as multiple macro-level data sources to analyze the association between development indicators, labor market context, social policy arrangements, and the gender employment gap. We find that typical growth indicators, global market integration, and social policy arrangements are not at all or only weakly associated with the gender employment gap in this region. Instead, the labor market context, specifically the degree of segregation and the size of the public and service sectors, are more important for shaping women's labor market opportunities relative to men's at both time points. Our findings contribute to the literature on the trade-offs between job segregation and aspects of gender inequality as well as to ongoing debates within the field of "gender and development" by pointing out important variations across regions.

AB Studies of the link between housework and sex sometimes reach divergent conclusions-partly resulting from varying perspectives on this relationship. We identify three perspectives found in prior studies of housework and sex-temporal, distributional, and fairness-each reflecting a different view of the processes linking these two domestic realms. To contribute to this literature, we examine housework measures reflecting each perspective. Negative binomial and OLS regression models using data from the National Survey of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS 2, 2004-2006) reveal that housework measures reflecting the fairness and distributional perspectives are significantly associated with sexual satisfaction but not frequency. Lower sexual satisfaction is associated with wives' greater investment in housework than husbands' and the view of housework arrangements as unfair to wives. These findings, which held for wives and husbands, suggest that the inequitable, and gendered, housework arrangements of many heterosexual married couples may negatively affect their sex lives. Measures reflecting the temporal perspective are associated with neither sexual satisfaction nor frequency. Our findings are derived from an older sample than those used in most prior studies of this topic, raising the possibility that some processes linking housework and sex change as individuals age and their relationships lengthen.

AB This paper uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) to describe county-level variation in norms regarding physical weight among adolescents in the United States. We demonstrate that regardless of one's physical size, those residing in counties with a heavier weight norm are significantly less likely to see themselves as overweight than those residing in counties with a light weight norm. We further show that the local weight norm during adolescence (Wave 1) is associated with individuals' weight perceptions through adolescence and into young adulthood (Wave 4), though these associations attenuate in strength as respondents age. Our results suggest that weight norms have a stronger influence on weight perceptions among women compared to men, and that the role of gender is particularly important during adolescence. We encourage life course researchers to consider the normative health environment during adolescence as an important context for understanding disparities in health and health lifestyles as people age.

AB Social inequalities in health and human capital are core concerns of sociologists, but little research examines the developmental stage when such inequalities are likely to emerge-the transition to adulthood. With new data and innovative statistical methods, we conceptually develop, and empirically operationalize, pathways of physical health and human capital accumulation from adolescence into young adulthood, using an autoregressive cross-lagged structural equation model. Results reveal that pathways of health and human capital accumulate at differential rates across the transition to adulthood; evidence of cross-lagged effects lends support for both social causation and health selection hypotheses. We then apply this model to assess the presence of social inequality in metabolic syndrome-the leading risk factor of cardiovascular disease in the United States. Findings document social stratification of cardiovascular health that is robust to both observed and unobserved social and health selection mechanisms. We speculate that this social stratification will only increase as this cohort ages.

TI "Going with the Flow": How College Men's Experiences of Unwanted Sex Are

AB While scholars are giving greater attention than previously to sexual assault against women, they have ignored the fact that men report unwanted sex as well. This article examines thirty-nine heterosexual men's narratives about their experience of unwanted sex in college. My analysis of these data shows how unwanted sex with women is interactionally produced through a process where men seek to save face and to make sense to others. Unwanted sex relates not only to interactional processes, but also to the content of what is considered acceptable behavior in heterosexual interactions. That is, cultural norms governing gender provide the content for what allows a man to save face and for his actions to make sense to a female partner. In particular, men consent to unwanted sex because accepting all opportunities for sexual activity is a widely accepted way to perform masculinity. Findings also show that men conduct their sex lives in the shadow of presumed gendered reputational consequences. They fear ridicule if stories are told portraying them as the kind of man who does not jump at any opportunity for sex with an attractive woman. Moreover, it seems that women, as arbitrators of men's sense of self, may play an important role in policing masculinity and upholding gender expectations, at least in undergraduate sexual cultures. Amidst current attention to sexual assault on college campuses, I argue for a closer look at the importance of interaction and the implicit gendered rules of what is considered acceptable and masculine in heterosexual interaction.

AB Proponents of the devaluation hypothesis claim that occupations experiencing a significant inflow of female workers are devalued, both in status and in pay. We suggest that devaluation is an essentially cultural phenomenon that can be subject to change over time and that is not constant with varying contexts. Our theoretical model connects changing gender compositions in occupations with the formation of occupational gender stereotypes. In combination with a cultural bias that attributes less value to female work, these stereotypes can lead to devaluation. This is a novel view on the mechanics at play in the devaluation process. With US census data from 1960 to 2010, we show that devaluation was restricted to sometimes very specific contexts. A trend toward declining or disappearing devaluation is observed over the entire time span. Given potential cultural inertia and the stability of stereotypes, this result could, however, be an artifact of a deficient testing strategy that focuses solely on changes in occupational gender compositions without taking into account the normative power of the past.

DT Article

   MOBILIZATION; CONTENTION; DYNAMICS; REFORM
AB This study uses insider ethnographic and interview data to examine one of the largest sustained collective actions in the history of the United States-the Wisconsin Uprising of 2011. It finds that this event took a highly unusual form due to a social relation that I term escalating moral obligation, a sense of solidaristic duty that grows increasingly fervent as others struggle on behalf of a shared cause. Each of three active groups within the movement engaged in arduous and unconventional resistance to controversial legislation, and did so in a manner that induced moral debt among the other groups. Fervency of commitment to the cause increased as a result of allies taking risky or self-sacrificial actions. Each group felt obligated to continue difficult mobilization as long as others continued theirs. Escalating moral obligation develops a simultaneously emergent, endogenous, and cognitive dimension of social movements. It is a relational mechanism linking political opportunity with actual mobilization. The political opportunity in this case was a combination of several conditions: an elite cleavage over the desirability of public unions, a more local balance of power allowing dissident legislators to obstruct but not defeat legislation, and an immediate severe popular reaction. This mechanism is potentially generalizable to other risky or arduous protests. When activists are motivated by the sacrifice or risk-taking of allied activists, escalating moral obligation is present. The concept links group-level imperatives with individual-level motivations. Escalating moral obligation shows one way that individual subjectivities can change through group interrelations and emotionally intense interactions.

AB Though bureaucratic corruption is widespread, social scientists have yet to develop a comprehensive model predicting ordinary people's engagement in corrupt exchanges with street-level bureaucrats. Our article fills this gap by specifying an individual-level causal model of bureaucratic corruption centered around three theoretically derived predictors: beliefs about acceptability of corruption, its perceived riskiness, and its utility to the offender. In doing so, we develop a theory of how institutional stability affects rates and causal pathways to bureaucratic corruption. Using the data from nationally representative surveys in Russia (N = 2,000) and Ukraine (N = 1,535), we test a path-diagramed structural equation model that accounts for endogeneity and the relationships among the theoretically derived predictors of corruption. The tests of our model in institutionally more stable Russia and less stable Ukraine, combined with OLS regression models on split samples from conflict areas within each country, show that when institutions have greater stability, (1) citizens are less likely to partake in bureaucratic corruption, and (2) the effects of theoretically derived predictors on corruption behavior are stronger. We are the first to incorporate into a theory of bureaucratic corruption a feedback loop whereby engagement in corruption reinforces perceptions of its spread, which in turn contributes to the belief that bribery is acceptable. Our findings explain the variation in corruption behavior among citizens of high-corruption societies, extend the institutional theory of social control, testify to the importance of contextualizing theories of crime, and reveal the need to tailor anti-corruption policies to specific institutional environments.

   STIGMA; DISADVANTAGE; STEREOTYPES; JEOPARDY; IMPACT
AB The manner in which social categories combine to produce inequality lies at the heart of scholarship on social stratification. To date, scholars have largely pointed to two primary ways that negatively stereotyped categories may aggregate: 1) additive effects, whereby one category has similar consequences across the other category, and 2) amplified congruence, whereby a secondary category exacerbates the negative effects of the first category. This article develops an alternative potential aggregation pattern-muted congruence-which posits that when individuals evaluate others that occupy multiple social positions about which stereotypes are highly congruent, such as being black and being unemployed, the additional category membership will have limited influence over the ultimate evaluation. Using evidence from a field experiment, where fictitious applications were submitted to real job openings, I examine which aggregation pattern most accurately reflects how race and unemployment shape actual hiring decisions. In line with predictions from the "muted congruence" perspective, the findings indicate that racial discrimination is prominent, but that there are limited additional negative effects of unemployment for African American workers. I conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for understanding the aggregation of social categories in the production of inequality.

AB While health inequalities related to race/ethnicity, nativity, and age are well documented, it remains unclear how these axes of stratification combine to shape health trajectories, especially in middle and late life. This study addresses gaps in the literature by drawing on both life course and intersectionality perspectives to understand inequalities in morbidity trajectories. Using growth curve models applied to data from the Health and Retirement Study, I examine the life course patterning of health inequalities among US-and foreign-born non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans between the ages of 51 and 80 (N = 16,265). Findings are consistent with premature aging and cumulative disadvantage processes: US-and foreign-born blacks and Mexican Americans experience earlier health deterioration than US-born whites, and they also tend to exhibit steeper health declines with age. Moreover, contrary to the common assumption of monolithic healthy immigrant and erosion processes, results show that these processes are contingent on both race/ethnicity and age: compared with US-born whites, white immigrants have a persistent health advantage, while black and Mexican American immigrants experience a health disadvantage that increases with age. These results suggest that among nonwhite immigrants, the immigrant health advantage may be offset by cumulative exposure to racialized immigrant incorporation processes. A wide array of health-related factors including socioeconomic resources, health behaviors, and medical care account for some, but not all, group differences in morbidity trajectories. Findings highlight the utility of life course and intersectionality perspectives for understanding health inequalities.

AB Millions of workers in the United States experience volatile weekly working hours and nonstandard shift work, particularly following the Great Recession. These aspects of work schedules bring greater economic insecurity and work-life conflict, particularly for low-wage workers. In the absence of strong and widespread policies regulating work hours in the United States, labor unions may significantly limit varying hours and nonstandard shifts. However, any benefits of union membership could depend on local unionization rates, which vary widely between states. This paper analyzes the relationship between union membership and varying weekly work hours and nonstandard schedules among hourly workers using data from the 2004-2007 and 2008-2012 Surveys of Income and Program Participation. The results show that union members were significantly less likely to report varying numbers of hours from week to week, particularly in states with relatively high unionization rates. In contrast, union members were more likely to report nonstandard schedules. The earnings penalties for varying hours and nonstandard schedules are significantly weaker among union members than non-members. Altogether, the results demonstrate some of unions' continued benefits for workers, and some of their limitations.

AB How do rival organizational forms that are associated with different ideological values affect each other's growth? And how do ideological polarization and state regulation impact the growth of these rival organizational forms? We adopt a community ecology framework as the stepping-stone to answer these questions in the context of a study of the dynamics of the Turkish high school educational system from 1971 to 1998-a period characterized by important regulatory changes amid growing ideological polarization between religious Islamic and secular factions. We explore how micro-level ideological Islamic-secular polarization and macro-level state regulation as to female participation may impact the meso-level interaction among high school forms. We demonstrate that rival organizational forms affect each other's growth positively, on average, but that this mutualism is reduced by ideological polarization and reinforced by the increase in female participation in Islamic high school education.

AB Collective action scholars have long examined why people choose to participate in social movements. This article argues that this body of scholarship can be productively applied to understanding rescue efforts during genocide, which have typically been associated with altruism and other psychological explanations. We analyze the case of Rwanda, where people worked collectively to save Tutsi from the violence that swept across the country in 1994, and ask: What social factors shaped Rwandans' decisions and abilities to save persecuted individuals? To address this question, we draw upon 35 in-depth interviews and a survey of 273 individuals who participated in rescue efforts, which constitutes one of the largest samples of rescue efforts to date. Although much previous literature has emphasized the role of stable personality traits in influencing such high-risk decisions, conceptualizing rescue as dynamic collective action enables us to examine social and contextual factors. Specifically, we illustrate how biographical availability, socialization, and situational contexts may influence rescue efforts. These findings contribute to scholarship on high-risk, clandestine collective action by illuminating how a combination of factors, including biographical availability, socialization, and situational contexts, coalesce to make rescue possible. As such, these findings inform our understanding of collective action that resulted in thousands of individuals being spared from torture, sexualized violence, and death.

TI Can Elites Shape Public Attitudes Toward Immigrants?: Evidence from the
   2016 US Presidential Election
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID CUES; OPINION; FRAMES; LIMITS
AB It is well known that political elites can shape public attitudes toward policies and values. Less is known, however, about whether elites can also influence public perceptions of social groups they praise or denounce. I test this by analyzing the attitudinal effects of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign announcement speech, in which he referred to Mexican immigrants as "rapists" and "criminals." First, to provide causal estimates, I analyze survey data using a counterfactual approach. I find evidence that Trump's statements negatively affected public opinion toward immigrants particularly among groups with restrictionist tendencies. Second, using a panel survey experiment, I corroborate this causal relationship but find that these effects are short-lived. This explains why restrictionist politicians like Trump constantly prod natives to keep their messages' effects from dissipating. I also find that only negative messages are consequential and find no evidence that elite statements are more impactful than those from non-elites, suggesting that the power of elite rhetoric lies primarily in its capacity to reach the masses via the news media.

AB This paper investigates the question of whether and how race and race relations affect state legislators' support for restrictive immigration policy. Focusing on the nine new immigration destinations in the US Southeast, we compare the roll call votes cast by African American and White Democratic state legislators on 196 restrictive immigration measures proposed between 2005 and 2012. Overall, the majority of Black Democratic legislators support restrictive immigration legislation, although at a consistently lower rate than White Democratic legislators. We test hypotheses that Black-White differences in support for restrictive immigration legislation depend upon the material resources at stake and the symbolic significance associated with specific legislation. Using bill topic to measure these conditions, we find that Black and White Democrats equally support immigrant "competition" bills on employment topics. Black Democratic legislators are less likely than their White counterparts to support immigration bills on Black-immigrant "commonalities" topics related to civil rights issues: voter ID regulations, education, police, and omnibus restrictions. Further, for civil rights bills only, district threat indicators such as a rapidly growing district Latino population are much more likely to increase support for restrictive immigration bills among White Democratic legislators than among Black Democratic legislators. Some district characteristics even evoke a commonalities response from African American Democratic legislators, reducing their support for restrictive legislation. Our research thus expands the competition/commonalities debate and highlights the complexities and contingencies of race relations and state policymaking in the twenty-first century.

AB This paper extends existing world society literature on the international diffusion of norms by examining divergence in world society. First, we identify polarizing trends in national regulation of homosexuality. Since 2005, the dominant post-WWII global trend toward liberalization has been challenged by a countervailing trend in which some countries have adopted more repressive laws regulating homosexuality. Second, we seek to identify whether states' alignment with either liberal or conservative world models influences public opinion. Analyzing three waves of data on public acceptance of homosexuality from the Pew Global Attitudes Survey between 2002 and 2013, we find that world public opinion concerning homosexuality has become increasingly polarized and that public opinion is embedded in broader institutional structures. Characteristics including education, age, and religious affiliation (and the lack of thereof) also affect individual acceptance of homosexuality, whereas the influence of age and education has diminished over time.

ID POLITICAL-IDEOLOGY; PARTY POLARIZATION; ATTITUDES; RESPONSES; CULTURE;
   TRENDS
AB Even after two decades of intense research, social scientists are still in disagreement over whether the American public is polarized. Starting from the premise that disagreement is multifaceted, this paper attempts to clarify how and which aspects of ideological disagreement have changed over the past few decades. Three major structural features of ideological disagreement that have been discussed under the umbrella term "polarization" are identified from the literature-polarization, partisan sorting, and dimensional alignment-and redefined into analytically distinct and non-overlapping concepts. Two different scaling methods are applied to the American National Election Studies from 1980 to 2012 in order to examine changes in how citizens organize their attitudes regarding concrete political and social issues (operational ideology) and their self-identifications with the ideological labels "liberal" and "conservative" (symbolic ideology). Results show at best mixed evidence of growing polarization. Partisan sorting has increased over time on both symbolic and operational ideology. However, it is mainly the symbolic side on which disagreement across partisan lines is most pronounced. Finally, contrary to the popular notion of a culture war dividing the United States, the public has become less polarized on moral issues, and the moral dimension of citizens' operational ideology has become dealigned from the economic and civil rights dimension over the past decade.

ID ETHNIC DISTANCE; ATTITUDES; INSTITUTIONS; IMMIGRANTS; CRUSADES; IMPACT
AB Using data from several periods of English history and building on the literature on culture and institutions, we analyze the co-evolution of education and attitudes toward women's and minority rights. First, we establish a strong association between the size of twenty-first-century educational institutions in a given location and the attitudes prevalent there: the proximity of a large college or university is associated with individual support for women's and minority rights, regardless of whether the individual has been to university. Second, we present evidence for high inter-temporal persistence in the geographical variation in the density of educational institutions over several centuries. Third, we show that the geographical distribution of later educational institutions depends not only on the distribution of medieval institutions, but also on correlates of medieval exposure to ethnic and religious diversity that are likely to have influenced attitudes. Institutions and culture co-evolve, and the inter-temporal persistence of the density of educational institutions is one mechanism (though probably not the only one) that explains the association between medieval exposure to diversity and twenty-first-century attitudes.

AB The well-established association between economic output and carbon emissions has led researchers in sociology and related disciplines to study new approaches to climate change mitigation, including policies that stabilize or reduce GDP growth. Within this degrowth approach, working time reduction is a key policy lever to reduce emissions as well as protect employment. In the United States, the abdication of responsibility for mitigation by the federal government has led to the emergence of state climate leadership. This study is the first to analyze the relationship between emissions and working hours at the state level. Our findings suggest that over the 2007-2013 period, state-level carbon emissions and average working hours have a strong, positive relationship, which holds across a variety of model estimation techniques and net of various political, economic, and demographic drivers of emissions. We conclude that working time reduction may represent a multiple dividend policy, contributing to enhanced quality of life and lower unemployment as well as emissions mitigation.

AB Inequality in family wealth is high, yet we know little about how much and how wealth inequality is maintained across generations. We argue that a long-term perspective reflective of wealth's cumulative nature is crucial to understand the extent and channels of wealth reproduction across generations. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics that span nearly half a century, we show that a one-decile increase in parents' wealth position is associated with an increase of about four percentiles in their offspring's wealth position in adulthood. We show that grandparental wealth is a unique predictor of grandchildren's wealth, above and beyond the role of parental wealth, suggesting that a focus on only parent-child dyads understates the importance of family wealth lineages. Second, considering five channels of wealth transmission-gifts and bequests, education, marriage, homeownership, and business ownership-we find that most of the advantages arising from family wealth begin much earlier in the life course than the common focus on bequests implies, even when we consider the wealth of grandparents. We also document the stark disadvantage of African American households in terms of not only their wealth attainment but also their intergenerational wealth mobility compared to whites.

AB While maternal employment has become the norm in advanced industrial nations, gendered norms of parenting and employment disadvantage mothers in the labor force. This paper sheds new light on motherhood pay gaps by investigating the contribution of an understudied dynamic-mothers' overrepresentation in low-paying workplaces. Estimating between-and within-establishment wage gaps with nationally representative Canadian linked employer-employee data reveals that segregation in low-paying establishments accounts for the bulk of mothers' wage disadvantage relative to childless women. Pay gaps net of human capital differences are not chiefly a result of mothers' lower wages vis-a-vis similar women in a given workplace, but rather stem from the fact that mothers are disproportionately employed in workplaces that pay all employees relatively poorly. Having identified the importance of between-establishment segregation, additional analyses probe support for two theories about underlying mechanisms: compensating differentials tied to family-supportive work contexts, and discrimination. While each plays a role, evidence is strongest for discrimination, with organizational characteristics that tend to reduce opportunities for discrimination also dramatically reducing or eliminating motherhood pay gaps.

AB The recent expansion of for-profit colleges in US higher education has ignited much debate over the potential contributions, and limitations, of profit-maximizing educational businesses to socioeconomic inequality. For-profit colleges have a strong economic incentive to retain students, and can offer innovative services in order to compete with more established institutions. But for-profit colleges may also seek to increase revenues in ways that are not beneficial for student outcomes. Using detailed longitudinal information on a nationally representative sample of recent high school students (ELS 2002), this paper provides the first comprehensive and systematic assessment of the effect of attendance at for-profit colleges on socioeconomic inequality in student outcomes, measured as the attainment of bachelor's degrees. Results from logit models and weighted regression technique indicate that low-SES students that attend for-profit colleges are substantially less likely to earn a bachelor's degree than observationally similar students that attend non-profit open admission colleges. By contrast, enrollment at for-profit colleges has little bearing on the likelihood of high-SES students to earn a bachelor's degree. These findings suggest that for-profit colleges contribute to the maintenance of socioeconomic disadvantage, in that low-SES students with mobility aspirations are paying more for their education and yet are less likely to reap the benefits of their investment.

AB Using a set of user-generated data, we examine patterns in the careers of professional chefs. We argue that this is one of many cases in which careers must be understood as shaped by dual structures-the typical occupational structure within a firm, and the organization of firms in a larger field. We then demonstrate how career trajectories may be formalized as movement through a two-dimensional space defined by status in these structures. Building on previous ethnographic work finding that chefs understand the logic of their careers as involving repeated trade-offs between their occupational status (their rank within the kitchen) and organizational status (the status of the restaurant at which they work), we attempt to determine how different trajectories are associated with different outcomes. We find that, despite the somewhat random nature of entrance into the culinary profession, future top-tier chefs disproportionately begin their careers at high-status restaurants. Beyond their auspicious beginnings, these top-chefs-to-be also commonly devote their early careers to maximizing organizational status, forgoing promotions to higher kitchen ranks in favor of low-level jobs at more prestigious restaurants. By comparison, chefs destined to run lower-status restaurants tend to spend their early careers prioritizing rapid advancement within the kitchen, only pursuing jobs at more prestigious restaurants much later in their careers, with limited success.

AB In this article, we investigate the redistributive outcomes of the Finnish pension system. We hypothesize that a pension system does not straightforwardly diminish, maintain, or increase income differences after retirement, but it can have different outcomes for different groups. Our focus is on differences in changes in income between groups that vary in their timing and type of retirement. We make use of longitudinal register-based data from the Finnish Centre for Pensions and analyze income and retirement trajectories of Finnish employees born in 1948 from the age of 57 to 66 (N = 44,449). Our aim is to find out in what way trajectories of income from earnings and pensions are related to different types of retirement trajectories, while controlling for gender, sector of employment, and length of working life. Eight distinct retirement trajectories are identified using sequence analysis. The results of our multilevel regression models indicate that the pension system sustains inequalities related to gender and employment sector. Early old-age retirement and part-time retirement are associated with higher earnings and more generous pension entitlements, indicating cumulative advantage. Lower earnings are associated with higher risk of early exit through unemployment and disability pensions, while the pension system guarantees a minimum income level in retirement, resulting in status leveling. Those who retire later are relatively well off in work, but worse off in retirement, suggesting a status-leveling outcome. By disentangling these outcomes of the pension system, it is possible to learn social policy lessons for other national institutional contexts as well.

AB The impact of participation in extracurricular activities on academic success has long been studied in the social sciences. This article aims at improving the measurement and understanding of this impact. Based on panel data regression models applied to a panel of French middle school students, it first provides a robust estimation of the impact of extracurricular activities on school outcomes (marks in French and Mathematics) and on a set of cognitive and non-cognitive skills. It finds a positive and significant impact on marks in French and Mathematics and scores on non-cognitive skills tests. No impact is found on cognitive skills. The article then investigates the underlying mechanisms of this impact. Its findings do not reinforce the transfer paradigm, according to which extracurricular activities provide students who participate in them with skills that they can reinvest in school life. Neither does it support the notion that such an impact may primarily be the result of students' greater connivance with the cultural standards of teachers. Instead, it seems likely that what is mainly at stake in participation in extracurricular activities is families' unequal capacity for extending the time of school supervision in their children's free time. Therefore, insofar as the varying participation in these activities is strongly correlated to differences in students' social and cultural background, participation in extracurricular activities would in itself contribute to reinforcing social inequalities in school achievement.

AB Leisure time activity is often positioned as a key factor in child development, yet we know relatively little about the causal significance of various specific activities or the magnitude of their effects. Here, we couple individual fixed effects and instrumental variable approaches in trying to determine whether specific forms of leisure contribute to gains in test performance over time. We merge a restricted access version of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) Child Development Supplement (CDS), longitudinally collected from 1997 to 2007, with a database of over three million county-day observations of sunlight. We use this proxy for weather to instrument for the variation in physical, outdoor, sedentary, and screen-time behaviors based on CDS time diaries. We find evidence that physical and outdoor activity positively influence math performance, while sedentary behavior and screen time exhibit the opposite effect. Moreover, the effect sizes range from a fifth to more than half a standard deviation per additional daily hour of activity, rendering them meaningful in a real-world sense. Our stratified results indicate that children from less educated mothers and girls seem to be most sensitive to the effects of active and passive forms of leisure. We conclude with a descriptive examination of the trend lines between our data and the new 2014 CDS cohort, providing relevant contemporary context for our findings.

AB Individuals with disabilities experience lower education levels, lower employment rates, fewer household resources, and poorer health than people without disabilities. Yet, despite comprising more than one-eighth of the US population, people with disabilities are seldom integrated into sociological studies of inequality. This study uses time use as a lens through which to understand one type of inequality between working-aged people with and without disabilities: participation in daily activities. It also tests whether social disparities (as suggested by the social model of disability) or health disparities (as suggested by the medical model of disability) explain a larger percentage of participation differences. I first consider if disability predicts daily time in market work, nonmarket work, tertiary (health-related) activities, and leisure-net of health and sociodemographic characteristics. Next, I utilize Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to assess the relative contribution of these characteristics in explaining time differences. Results from the American Time Use Survey indicate that adults with disabilities spend less time than adults without disabilities in market work and more time in tertiary activities and leisure. There is no difference in nonmarket time. Health accounts for the largest percentage of the explained component of tertiary time differences, but depending on the choice of predictors, sociodemographic characteristics account for as much-or more-of the explained component of differences in market and leisure time. Results indicate the importance of disentangling disability from health in sociological studies of inequality. They also support a hybrid disability model in suggesting that both health and sociodemographic characteristics determine how disability shapes daily life.

AB It is well established that women have surpassed men in educational attainment. The potential effect of educational institutional structures on the "rise of women" has largely been overlooked. In particular, the age of first selection into distinct educational tracks seems important, as the female-favorable gap in educational performance has been shown to widen during the high school years. Using microdata from the European Social Survey and data on tracking age reforms for 21 European countries from 1929 to 2000, we find that reforms promoting later tracking have particularly benefited girls' years of education, net of other influential factors (gender-ideological climate and demand on the labor market). This finding shows that the rise of women is not homogeneous across institutional contexts: some educational systems are more supportive of the enhancement of women's education than others.

   ORIENTATION; IDEOLOGY CONSTRUCTION; YOUNG ADULTHOOD; DAUGHTERS; WOMEN;

AB Prior studies of gender and family attitudes indicate that the arrival of a child, a major life-course event, may contribute to shifts in these attitudes. Virtually no research, however, examines attitudinal changes accompanying parenthood in non-Western contexts, where childrearing experiences are likely to differ. Using longitudinal data and fixed-effects models, we investigate how having a child, as well as having a daughter versus a son, is associated with changes in attitudes toward gender and family issues in Japan, a country known for its highly gendered distribution of child-related responsibilities within families. Contrary to previous findings that parenthood has a "traditionalizing" effect in the United States and other Western societies, we find that women in Japan generally become less supportive of traditional gender roles as their number of children increases. They also become more approving of divorce after having a daughter. Conversely, Japanese men experience fewer changes, although they do become less positive about the value of jobs for women with additional children and more negative about a child's impact on the couple after adding a son. We argue that the relatively high tolerance of dissonance between attitudes and behaviors in East Asian cultures weakens the psychological motivation for the Japanese to align their views with their increasingly gendered behaviors upon entering parenthood. At the same time, women's experience with greater gender inequality within the household provides them with more incentives to be critical of gendered practices and institutions, resulting in less traditional attitudes as they have more children.

AB Social disorganization theory is one of the most widely tested theories in criminology, yet few studies consider the temporal and spatial dynamics of neighborhood composition, neighborhood informal social control, and crime. To better understand these relationships, we use census data, police data, and three survey waves of data from a unique longitudinal dataset with over 4,000 respondents living across 148 neighborhoods in an Australian city undergoing rapid population growth. We employ cross-lagged reciprocal feedback models to test the central tenets of social disorganization theory and its contemporary advances for three crime types: violent crime, property crime, and drug crime. Further, we examine the reciprocal relationship between neighborhood composition, three components of informal social control (neighborhood social ties, expectations for informal social control, and the exercise of informal social control), and crime and whether socio-demographic changes in nearby neighborhoods shape these relationships over time. We find that changes in the socio-demographic composition in both focal and nearby areas influence neighborhood informal social control; however, in contrast to cross-sectional studies of social disorganization theory, our results reveal little support that neighborhood informal social control significantly decreases crime over time.

AB We examine the association between ties to delinquent friends and suicidal ideation among adolescents, and whether this association varies across neighborhoods. We analyze two waves of data from the Korean Youth Panel Survey, which comprise nationally representative samples of high school students in South Korea, a country with the highest suicide rate in the developed world. Results from hierarchical linear models show that, net of individual and contextual-level predictors, connections to delinquent peers significantly raise the odds of adolescent suicidality. We also find this relationship to be stronger in more affluent and better-quality neighborhoods. We draw on the concept of the "black sheep effect" to discuss the implications of these findings.

AB Since the late 1990s, a growing body of literature has researched the cross-national diffusion of policies that affect lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities. Studies stemming from world society consider how state ties to newly emergent global norms regarding the treatment of LGBT communities are a driver of this process. A shortcoming of these studies, however, is that they do not adequately consider which type of ties to global norms are most meaningful for policy adoption. Considering the ever-increasing notion that LGBT rights are human rights, this study contrasts the role of human rights international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and LGBT INGOs on LGBT policy diffusion between 1991 and 2015. While previous studies assume a global norm exists, focus on a narrow band of policies, or restrict analyses to key geographic areas, this study develops a new measure of global LGBT norms and offers a comprehensive LGBT Policy Index for a global sample of 156 countries. Through pooled cross-sectional time series with fixed effects, the results demonstrate that human rights INGOs are not adequate vehicles for pressuring national adoption of LGBT policies. Instead, targeted advocacy efforts, embodied through LGBT INGOs, are required in order for policy adoption to transpire.

AB Groups often designate a leader to enforce their members' contributions to collective efforts. Prior work has demonstrated that allowing groups to democratically elect a leader is particularly effective at enhancing cooperation once the elected leader obtains the position. Here I go further by considering whether people vie to win elected leadership positions, contributing more to collective efforts even before the leader is elected. Specifically, I demonstrate that groups typically elect their more cooperative members to leadership. Individual members anticipate this and compete for leadership by increasing their contributions to collective efforts when they expect leaders will be elected by voters with knowledge of candidates' prior behaviors, compared to when cooperative behaviors are visible, but leaders will be appointed (Study 1), or when leaders will be elected, but not on the basis of candidates' cooperative behaviors (Study 2). Though prior work has centered on the beneficial effects of elected leadership after an election is held, I demonstrate a novel mechanism by which elections promote cooperation: before the election is held, via competition for leadership. More generally, the results suggest that the leader selection process is a critical factor in determining the success of groups facing collective action problems.

AB This research uses comparative survey data to examine the effects of labor union membership on individual political participation. We argue that national political institutions-specifically, democracy and corporatism-shape the ways that unions mobilize their members to engage in the political sphere. Democratic regimes provide structural opportunities and cultural repertoires that lead unions to focus on member mobilization, especially via contentious politics and political parties. Corporatism, which directly links unions to state structures, undercuts the logics and incentives for union mobilization. We draw upon historical cases of Germany, the United States, Chile, and Egypt to illustrate how democracy and corporatism shape unions' mobilization efforts. Multilevel models of World Values Survey data from roughly 60 countries find that union members participate more than non-members across a range of electoral and extra-institutional political acts, such as demonstrating, occupying buildings, signing petitions, party work, and so forth. In democratic societies, such effects are stronger and participation shifts toward parties and contentious politics. In less democratic societies, union members are particularly likely to work with and through other political organizations. Corporatist arrangements generally dampen the political activities of union members.

AB Why do ethnic and racialized minorities have lower trust? While previous research emphasizes individual factors such as the national and cultural origins of ethnic groups, this paper draws attention to the ethnic majority-minority relationship. We argue that ethnic differences in trust are a function of the power dynamics underlying this relationship and that these dynamics are particularly salient in democratic political systems. To test this argument, we develop new measures of ethnic majority-minority status, which for the first time allows for global cross-national comparison of heterogeneous ethnic groups at the micro level. Using the World Values Survey, we test the majority-minority argument, showing that, while democracy increases generalized trust across the board, it also leads to a gap in trust that favors the majority group. This gap remains even after the inclusion of controls for country differences in factors such as ethnic diversity and GDP.

AB We conceptualize immigrant incorporation as a categorically driven process and contrast the bright distinctions between first-generation immigrants and natives, with more blurry second-generation contrasts. We analyze linked employer-employee data of a sample of 5,097 employees in 97 large German organizations and focus on first- and second-generation immigrants. We explore how generational status in the labor market and workplace contexts expands and contracts native-immigrant wage inequalities. We find a substantial average first-generation immigrant-native wage gap, which is not explained by individual human capital differences or most aspects of organizational context. In contrast, there is, on average, no second-generation wage gap, but there are substantial variations across workplaces. A series of results confirm predictions from relational inequality theory. For both first- and second-generation immigrants, working in a high-inequality workplace is associated with larger wage gaps. Second-generation immigrants perform better in workplaces where they have intersectional advantages over natives, and for first-generation immigrants collective bargaining protection narrows wage gaps with natives. Consistent with ethnic competition theory, in workplaces with very high shares of immigrant workers, the first-generation-native wage gap is larger. In contrast, increased contact between native Germans and second-generation immigrant coworkers reduces earnings gaps, but only up to a tipping point, after which competition processes reappear and earning gaps widen.

AB Gender-role attitudes capture individuals' degree of support for traditional divisions of paid and domestic work and have been linked to the production and reproduction of gender inequality in different social spheres. Previous research has established that life-course transitions are related to within-individual over-time change in gender-role attitudes. Most importantly, becoming a parent is associated with shifts toward more traditional viewpoints. Theories of attitude change suggest that the gender of children should influence the pattern of gender-attitude shifts that accompany parenthood, but very few studies have investigated this. We add to this literature using Australian panel data from the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey (n = 29,918 observations) stretching over 15 years and fixed-effects panel regression models. We find that men's and women's gender-role attitudes become more traditional when they become parents, with evidence that this process is more pronounced among men, parents of daughters and, most of all, male parents of daughters.

TI Crimes of Terror, Counterterrorism, and the Unanticipated Consequences
   of a Militarized Incapacitation Strategy in Iraq
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID LEGAL CYNICISM; SOCIOLOGY; VIOLENCE
AB "COIN," the counter-terrorism doctrine the United States used during the Iraq War, was in criminological terms overly reliant on militarized "incapacitationist" strategies. Based a on competing "societal reactions" or community-level labeling theory, we argue that COIN failed to anticipate but predictably produced state-based "legal cynicism" in Arab Sunni communities-increasing rather than decreasing politically defiant terrorist crimes. We test our hypotheses with nationally representative surveys and data on terrorist attacks collected before, during, and immediately after the 2007 Surge in US troops. The Surge increased perceptions of unnecessary US-led violence against Arab Sunni non-combatants, provoking cynical beliefs in Arab Sunni communities, creating local contexts in which terrorist attacks increased, and foreshadowing later advances by the Islamic State. Our findings show that oversimplified, incapacitation-oriented control tactics-in domestic policing, in COIN, or in the traditional warfare strategies that are replacing COIN-are likely to contribute to rather than reduce cycles of violence.

TI Moral Economies or Hidden Talents? A Longitudinal Analysis of Union
   Decline and Wage Inequality, 1973-2015

   UNITED-STATES; PANEL-DATA; UNIONIZATION; MEMBERSHIP; INSTITUTIONS;
   POLITICS
AB The decline of labor unions in the United States has been central to the rise of wage inequality since the early 1970s. Recently, sociologists have noted that unionization influences inequality through both direct and indirect pathways, reconciled with the concept of the moral economy, broadly shared norms of fairness institutionalized in market rules and customs that can reduce inequality in pay. While the theory of the moral economy has been resonant in the stratification literature, few have held it to empirical scrutiny. The current study assesses how selection bias from unobserved worker-level heterogeneity influences the associations between unionization and wage attainment and dispersion. To do so, I merge data from the Current Population Survey to 33 waves of longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Using combinations of variance function regression models, fixed-effects regression models, and dynamic panel models, I find that the magnitudes of associations tend to be reduced by around half after accounting for unobserved heterogeneity. Yet, more critically, the pathways linking unions and wage inequality via the moral economy prove to be remarkably robust to all tests cast upon them. Results highlight the fundamental importance of labor power resources for the contemporary rise of inequality. They provide a micro-level foundation for theories linking unionization and stratification. They identify the importance of union decline for rising earnings volatility. And they provide implications for the fallout of economic well-being for workers following antiunion policy change. Additional theoretical and policy implications are discussed.

AB Studies typically find large variation in labor market outcomes not only between educational levels, but also among individuals with a higher education. However, the importance of different types of horizontal divisions in higher education is mostly treated in separate literatures. In this paper, we use multilevel models and an outcome-based approach to investigate the relative importance of institution (college), department, and field of study in the Norwegian labor market. We find that the effects of field of study on wages are generally strong. The overall effects of institution are also quite large, but they emerge to a considerable extent at the level of departments; the effects of institution over and above the effects of department are small. We also show that the effects of horizontal divisions are greater at the graduate than at the undergraduate level, and that the effects of horizontal divisions increase over individuals' work careers.

TI Salvation or Safety Net? Meanings of "College" among Working- and

DT Article
ID CLASS-INEQUALITY; IDENTITY; CULTURE; PEOPLE; SEX
AB In the wake of college-for-all policy, college aspirations among working-class and middle-class young adults have converged, yet class gaps in enrollment and completion persist. Building on previous literature that uncovers the structural barriers that block working-class mobility, we examine the specific narrative content that working-class and middle-class young adults and their parents attach to the broad "college for all" message. We investigate how their narratives of imagined futures shape how they perceive the riskiness of college decisions. In-depth interviews with 51 young adult-parent dyads suggest that working-class young adults envision college as a route to moral worth and an escape from their current grim reality-what we term "salvation." Their narratives lend self-efficacy and optimism to their lives, but are not organized in ways that protect them from the increasingly risky college landscape. Middle-class parents assume control over the meanings of college and deploy a narrative of insecurity about downward mobility in a competitive economy. By contesting the meaning of college as a vehicle for self-realization, this narrative buffers youth from risk even as it constrains feelings of self-determination in the transition to adulthood.

AB Neighborhoods are an important social context for children's development; however, a growing body of research illustrates that there is often significant heterogeneity in how neighborhoods influence children's outcomes. Scholars have therefore focused greater attention on understanding neighborhood effect heterogeneity and the social processes that underpin this variation. Recent quantitative work has pointed to heterogeneity by age in the effects of moving to low-poverty neighborhoods, but questions remain about the mechanisms that explain why youth of different ages have divergent outcomes after this move. This paper examines the social processes that drive differences in neighborhood effects by age through analysis of qualitative interviews with low-income Black youth who moved to lower-poverty and more racially integrated neighborhoods with a housing mobility program. The findings show that the process of friendship formation serves as an important mechanism for age differences in school engagement after moving to non-poor neighborhoods. Adolescents in this sample hesitated to form new friendships after moving, choosing a strategically cautious approach to engaging with new peers. In contrast, youth who moved during middle childhood quickly formed friendships in their new communities. These new friends then encouraged children's engagement and motivation in their new schools, amplifying the potential for children to experience positive educational effects following this move. Younger youth experienced the dual advantages of less exposure to high-poverty neighborhoods and an easier process of establishing new friendships in their suburban communities.

AB We investigate the implications of the persistence of traditional patterns of state organization by examining the relationship between property rights and the economy for monarchies and republics. We argue that, relative to republics, monarchies protect property rights to a greater extent by reducing the negative effects of internal conflict, executive tenure, and executive discretion. In turn, a better protection of property rights results in greater standards of living. Using panel data on 137 countries between 1900 and 2010, we formulate and test a model with endogenous variables. We find strong evidence that monarchies contribute to a greater protection of property rights and higher standards of living through each of the three theoretical mechanisms compared to all republics. We also find that democratic-constitutional monarchies perform better than non-democratic and absolute monarchies when it comes to offsetting the negative effects of the tenure and discretion of the executive branch. We discuss the implications of the persistence of traditional patterns of political authority and rule for political sociology and economic sociology.

AB World society scholars have focused on how international organizations lead nation-states to adopt similar policies, procedures, and programs in order to signal compliance to prevailing rules and norms. In this study, the authors propose that integration into world society is associated with higher levels of legal formalism, which in turn can result in lengthening the execution of legal procedures. The empirical analysis of the study combines a dataset of country-level membership in international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) with a dataset on legal formalism and procedural duration assembled by the Lex Mundi Project. The data cover an unusually large set of countries for an extensive period. The analyses consider two typical settings for everyday contract disputes-check cashing and tenant eviction-and find evidence consistent with the authors' claims.

ID HUMAN-RIGHTS; WOMENS MOVEMENT; SOCIETY; TRENDS; LAW; FERTILITY; EUROPE;
   POLITY; POWER; LIBERALIZATION
AB This paper extends the comparative literature on divorce by theorizing how international institutions and norms influence societal divorce rates. Drawing on developmental idealism and world society theory, the paper argues that global institutions legitimize cultural principles such as individualism, human rights, and gender equality, which reshape "modern" understandings of marriage and family relations. Formal international institutions and treaties do not explicitly proclaim or codify the right to divorce, but we suggest that new norms regarding divorce emerge from the "penumbras" of world culture and diffuse globally. Panel regression models covering 84 countries between 1970 and 2008 find a strong association between global cultural influence and divorce rates, controlling for other factors. Results highlight the effects of world society on the private lives of individuals, and suggest that world society affects a wider set of outcomes than the conventional literature would predict.

AB Whites' wealth advantage compared to blacks and Hispanics is vast and increases with age. While prior research on wealth gaps focuses primarily on wealth levels, we adopt a life-course perspective that treats wealth as a cumulative outcome and examine wealth accumulation across individuals' lives. We test to what extent intergenerational disadvantage and disparities in achieved characteristics explain accumulation disparities. We hypothesize that disparities in wealth determinants, like income and education, family and household characteristics, and homeownership and local context, increase through early and middle adulthood, widening wealth accumulation gaps. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, we show that whites accumulate wealth more rapidly than blacks and Hispanics throughout early and middle adulthood, with the result that both groups fall further behind whites in amassed wealth with each passing year. Furthermore, the accumulation gap grows substantially in the 30s, so that blacks and Hispanics in this age range lose ground at an increasing annual rate. We find that adjusting for intergenerational disadvantage reduces the Hispanic-white and black-white gaps in wealth accumulated between ages 20 and 50 by over 40 percent and 50 percent, respectively, and even more in young adulthood. Yet, disparities in outcomes like income, marriage, and homeownership rise with age; together, these intragenerational processes explain a greater share of accumulation gaps in middle adulthood than at younger ages. These findings highlight that wealth gaps in the United States are both shaped by intergenerational legacies of disadvantage and created fresh in each generation through unequal distribution of achieved wealth-enhancing traits.

ID IMPLICIT ASSOCIATION TEST; LABOR-MARKET; DISCRIMINATION; NETWORKS; RACE;
   JOB; GENDER; INFORMATION; EMPLOYMENT; WORKPLACE
AB Sociologists commonly point to jobseekers' racially segregated networks and employers' discriminatory behavior to explain racial inequality in employment. Network scholars argue that, given segregated networks and black and white employees' unequal position in the labor market, employers' reliance on employee referrals reproduces black disadvantage. Scholars of discrimination focus instead on employers' unequal treatment of equally qualified black and white jobseekers. Drawing on an original experiment with a sample of white individuals with hiring responsibilities, I seek to bridge these literatures by examining whether respondents' racial prejudice affects how they reward employee referrals of black and white applicants from black and white employees. I use a measure of implicit prejudice that is resistant to social desirability and that can capture biases among people who genuinely believe they are unbiased. Whether evaluated by low-prejudiced or high-prejudiced respondents, white applicants benefit greatly from same-race referrals. In contrast, black applicants do not benefit from same-race referrals, even when they are evaluated by low-prejudiced respondents. In fact, black applicants only benefit from having a referral when two conditions are met: the referring employee is white and they are evaluated by a relatively low-prejudiced respondent. These findings suggest that in addition to their disadvantage in access to employee referrals, black jobseekers suffer from a disadvantage in returns to these referrals.

TI Inequality and Ethnic Conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID HORIZONTAL INEQUALITIES; CIVIL-WAR; VIOLENCE; POLARIZATION
AB Theories of ethnic conflict predict that between-group inequality should be associated with a greater likelihood of violent conflict, but empirical results have been mixed. One reason might be that different types of inequalities have opposing effects on the likelihood of conflict. In this article, we posit that educational inequalities are likely to incentivize collective action by inducing grievances, while economic and demographic inequalities may actually dis-incentivize collective action by limiting opportunities for disadvantaged groups to engage in rebellion. We test these hypotheses on a new ethnic dyad database, incorporating 1,548 dyads formed by 290 ethnic groups living in 29 Sub-Saharan African countries. The analysis reveals that educational inequalities are indeed positively associated with conflict incidence, while this is not the case for economic and demographic inequalities. The association between educational inequality and conflict is stronger if the groups are wealthier. A higher joint educational level of the groups is associated with less conflict, particularly under more autocratic regimes. These findings demonstrate that to better understand the relationship between inequality and conflict, it is important to disaggregate the effects of inequalities according to the underlying mechanisms and the political context with which they are associated.

ID SYMBOLIC RACISM; PUBLIC-OPINION; RACE; PREJUDICE; ATTITUDES;
   CONTEMPORARY; POLITICS; IMPLICIT; BLACKS
AB Here, we integrate prior work to develop and test a theory of how perceived macro-level trends in racial standing shape whites' views of welfare policy. We argue that when whites perceive threats to their relative advantage in the racial status hierarchy, their resentment of minorities increases. This increased resentment in turn leads whites to withdraw support for welfare programs when they perceive these programs to primarily benefit minorities. Analysis of American National Election Studies data and two survey-embedded experiments support this reasoning. In Study 1, we find that whites' racial resentment increased beginning in 2008, the year of Barack Obama's successful presidential candidacy and a major economic downturn, the latter a factor previously shown to amplify racial threat effects. At the same time, whites' opposition to welfare increased relative to minorities'. In Study 2, we sought to better establish the causal effect of racial status threats. We found that experimentally presenting information suggesting that the white majority is rapidly declining increased whites' opposition to welfare, and this effect was mediated by heightened racial resentment. Finally, in Study 3 we found that threatening whites' sense of their economic advantage over minorities led whites to report greater opposition to welfare programs, but only if these programs were portrayed as primarily benefiting minorities, not if they were portrayed as benefiting whites. These findings suggest that whites' perceptions that minorities' standing is rising can produce periods of "welfare backlash" in which adoption of policies restricting or curtailing welfare programs is more likely.

TI Drug Market Violence Comes Home: Three Sequential Pathways
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMUNITY VIOLENCE; COLLECTIVE EFFICACY; CRIME; GUNS; NEIGHBORHOODS;
   ENFORCEMENT; AGGRESSION; EXPOSURE; STREET; GENDER
AB A wide range of sociological work documents higher rates of violence within households in neighborhoods where violence related to illicit drug markets is prevalent. Existing explanations for this association point to cultural scripts, to an absence of community social control, or to the effects of individual exposure to violence on the propensity to reproduce it. Drawing on in-depth interviews and field observations, we argue that much violence within the home may instead be understood as an extension of the systemic violence of the drug trade. That violence travels into homes by way of three often coexisting sequential pathways: 1) invasion, in which dealers enter homes in search of other drug market participants and families are caught in the middle; 2) protection, in which family members seek to protect themselves and each other from repeated theft of household items; and 3) preemption, in which parents use violence against their children in an effort to prevent more serious violence against them by other drug industry participants. This analysis sheds new light on the impacts of the current governance of drug markets and on the difficult choices faced by families in highly vulnerable contexts, contributing to a theorization of violence as situated not in individuals or groups but in patterned sequences of events.

AB This study tests the claim that police legitimacy affects the prevalence of homicide. Using a cross-national time-series dataset of 100 countries, I conduct a statistical analysis of the association between the extent to which the public perceives the police as legitimate and the homicide rate. The analysis suggests that police legitimacy has a substantial, negative association with homicide rates, consistent across different sources of homicide data and controlling for a variety of economic, political, and demographic variables. The paper provides evidence that police legitimacy is related to violent behavior, and that this relationship is generalizable across a wide range of contexts, but more pronounced in non-high-income and comparatively unequal countries.

LA English
DT Article
ID DIFFUSION; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; STEREOTYPES; COMPETENCE; RESISTANCE; POWER
AB Prior studies on innovation adoption have underscored that the refusal to adopt popular innovations becomes less accepted as such innovations spread. In this paper, I re-examine this prevailing account using the lens of gender. Focusing on the adoption of bird photography, a technologically advanced method to help save wild birds that became widespread in early twentieth-century America, I examine how gendered expectations in society shaped the adoption of an innovation. Using a unique database coded from archival documents of the first American bird protection movement, which was prominent between 1899 and 1920, I find that the non-adoption of a technological innovation is rather accepted when the meaning of the innovation is gendered and its (non) adoption is accountably masculine (or feminine). Stemming from that historical case, the results of this study have contemporary relevance to understanding the role of gendered expectations in shaping innovation adoption, particularly in science and technology.

TI From Chinatown to Every Town: New Patterns of Employment for Low-Skilled
   Chinese Immigrants in the United States
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID DESTINATIONS; COMMUNITIES; CONNECTION; ENCLAVES
AB Building on the growing literature on new immigrant destinations, this paper examines new employment patterns of low-skilled Chinese immigrants in the United States. We identify an important channel of employment in new destinations for the case of Chinese low-skilled immigrants: employment agencies in New York City's Chinatown. We carried out two surveys of employment agencies during 2010-2011. Our findings suggest that there has been a profound change in settlement patterns of low-skilled immigrants: moving away from traditional Chinatowns in major American cities toward non-gateway destinations and rural areas. These new settlement locations are characterized by a low unemployment rate and low crime rate. Contrary to predictions from ethnic economy and mainstream economic perspectives, Chinese restaurant jobs tend not to be in places with a high concentration of Chinese immigrants, but rather in places with a high proportion of non-Hispanic whites. In addition, the farther the jobs are from New York City, the higher the salary. We discuss the implications of this fundamental change for re-conceptualizing the immigrant labor market and immigrant socioeconomic mobility in American society.

TI Countering Trump: Toward a Theory of Charismatic Counter-Roles
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL MEDIA; MAX WEBER; CONSTRUCTION; POLITICS; LEADERSHIP; AGENCY
AB This article conducts a negative reading of Weber's ideal type of charismatic authority, seeking to anticipate and discern hidden social interactants that are implicated in his descriptions of charismatic social processes. In so doing, this article advances the "charismatic counter-role" as an umbrella term that captures the performative bearing of a variety of actors on processes of charismatic interaction. Specifically, in addition to devoted followers (already much discussed in the literature), this typology contains unworthy challengers (competitors who fall short when judged by the new terms of legitimacy that the charismatic leader creatively establishes); and colossal players (interlocutors that are appropriately "to scale" for highlighting the extraordinary missions to which the charismatic leader aspires). Together, these charismatic counter- roles interact in ways that comprise a charismatic social system that gives a better account than has heretofore been available for the unstoppable momentum of charismatic challenges. Using the "Trump phenomenon" of 2015-2016 as its empirical source, and employing analytical tools from symbolic interactionist and performative approaches to social theory, this article has implications for future studies of how charisma destabilizes traditional and/or rational-legal social orders.

AB Stratification and inequality are among the most central concepts in sociology, and although related, they are fundamentally distinct: inequality refers to the extent to which resources are distributed unevenly across individuals or between population subgroups, whereas stratification refers to the extent to which population subgroups occupy distinct hierarchical layers within an overall resource distribution. Despite the centrality of stratification in theories of class structure, prior empirical studies have focused exclusively on measures of inequality, which do not accurately capture the degree of class stratification and suffer from a variety of methodological limitations. In this paper, we employ a novel rank-based index of stratification to measure the degree to which occupational classes inhabit distinct, non-overlapping, and hierarchically arranged layers in the distribution of personal market income. The stratification index is nonparametric, both scale and translation invariant, and independent of the level of inequality. Based on this index, our results show that the US income distribution is highly stratified by occupational class and that the degree of class stratification increased substantially from 1980 to 2016. Moreover, we find that this trend is almost entirely due to growing stratification among aggregate occupational classes rather than among the disaggregate occupations nested within them. Finally, a set of counterfactual analyses indicate that the rise of occupational class stratification is driven by increases in the income returns to education, deunionization, and deindustrialization, although the relative importance of these factors varies by gender.

AB We advance current knowledge of school punishment by examining (1) the prevalence of exclusionary discipline in elementary school, (2) racial disparities in exclusionary discipline in elementary school, and (3) the association between exclusionary discipline and aggressive behavior in elementary school. Using child and parent reports from the Fragile Families Study, we estimate that more than one in ten children born between 1998 and 2000 in large US cities were suspended or expelled by age nine, when most were in third grade. We also find extreme racial disparity; about 40 percent of non-Hispanic black boys were suspended or expelled, compared to 8 percent of non-Hispanic white or other-race boys. Disparities are largely due to differences in childrens school and home environments rather than to behavior problems. Next, consistent with social stress and strain theories, we find suspension or expulsion associated with increased aggressive behavior in elementary school. This association does not vary by race but is robust to a rich set of covariates, within-individual fixed effects, and matching methods. In conjunction with what we find for racial disparities, our results imply that school discipline policies relying heavily on exclusionary punishment may be fostering childhood inequality.

AB This study evaluates how authorization status shapes job transitions among Mexican and Central American immigrants in the United States. Specifically, using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, we impute legal status and track employment histories for authorized and unauthorized workers, as well as native-born counterparts, in the less skilled labor market. We distinguish job moves based on changes in occupations and employers; and by linking workers jobs to expected wages in their occupations, we are able to determine whether job transitions result in occupational upgrades or downgrades. Results reveal that unauthorized immigrants have lower adjusted rates of job mobility, consistent with arguments that their lack of work authorization traps their employment. Moreover, when unauthorized migrants do change jobs, their transitions are characterized by a process of occupational churning in which they cycle between similarly positioned jobs and have low rates of upward mobility, both within and across firms. We also test the possibility that the wage returns to job mobility are conditioned by legal status. Finally, we find that the penalties to job mobility associated with unauthorized status are more severe for women than men, potentially because of their high levels of segregation in socially isolating jobs.

AB Extensive research explores how increasing ethnic out-group populations in society affects inter-group attitudes. Drawing on the threat and contact hypotheses, this study develops and tests a framework examining the role of segregation in the out-group size/prejudice relationship. We suggest that whether increasing minority share in a community generates processes of contact and/or perceived threat will depend on how segregated groups are from one another. This, in turn, will determine when high minority share communities have positive, negative, or null effects on inter-group attitudes. Using data from white British individuals in England, we observe that community segregation moderates the effect of community percent non-white British on prejudice, as well as mechanisms of positive inter-group contact and perceived threat. Residents of more homogeneous communities report relatively warm inter-group attitudes, regardless of how segregated they are. Residents living among high proportions of out-group where the groups are integrated report an improvement in out-group attitudes. It is only residents living among large out-group populations where groups are more segregated from one anotheruat the nexus of high minority share and high segregationuwho report colder out-group attitudes. This higher prejudice is driven by both lower positive contact and higher perceived threat in these communities. Using two waves of cohort panel data, longitudinal analysis provides more robust evidence in support of the diversity-segregation nexus framework: communities becoming more ethnically mixed and segregated see prejudice increase, while those becoming more mixed and integrated see stable, or somewhat improving, relations. Collectively, this paper shows that mechanisms of positive contact and threat appear conditional on both the size of out-groups in an area and how segregated groups are from one another, generating key differences in when and how increasing ethnic out-group size affects inter-group relations.

AB This paper uses the 20132015 NSFG, a representative US-based dataset of individuals 1544, to explore predictors of straight identification among all women and men and among subsets with substantial same-sex activity and/or attraction. After controlling for attractions and sexual practices, homophobia predicted straight identification in all groups. Among both groups of women, one femininity attitude and motherhood also predicted straight identification. One attitude reflecting alignment with normative masculinity significantly predicted straight identification among men with substantial same-sex activity and/or attraction. This paper also uses two waves of Add Health, a representative survey of young adults, to examine change to sexual identity over six years. Results show that among individuals who changed sexual identities between waves, heightened religiosity and political conservatism across waves were associated with increased odds of changing to a straight identity for women, but not for men. This suggests but does not prove a directional association between attitudes and identification for some individuals. Latent class analyses also found distinct groups of straight-identified men and women with substantial same-sex activity and/or attraction, indicating that it is a heterogeneous population in terms of attitudes, including homophobia. This suggests that straight identification is due partly to embeddedness in straight culture and enjoyment of straight privilege, not simply homophobia. While impossible to determine causality, the results show that straight identification is strongly related to non-sexual social factors, including religiosity and attitudes about sexuality and gender, in addition to attractions and sexual practices. The results also suggest that homophobia is related to identity formation for women, as well as men, but that there is substantial within-group variation.

   ENVIRONMENT; INEQUALITY; FERTILITY
AB Scholars of world society theory argue that integration in global society is important for shaping national outcomes related to gender relations, but past research has not examined how global society shapes individual gender attitudes. Additionally, past research on gender attitudes has not adequately considered contextual country-level determinants of these attitudes and has primarily focused on rich Western nations. In this article, I test hypotheses derived from world society theory about the relationship between country-level integration and individual gender attitudes using a broad sample of rich and developing nations. Using World Values Survey data from 64 countries, multilevel models of gender attitudes reveal that increased country-level ties to general and womens INGOs are associated with more egalitarian individual gender attitudes. This pattern holds after accounting for relevant domestic factors, differences based on region and religious tradition, other social and political dimensions of globalization, and time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity between countries. I conclude by considering the theoretical implications of these results.

AB Norwegian national policies strongly incentivize double-earner households and gender equality, but various gender gaps persist both at work and at home. In these seemingly contradictory situations, what are the mechanisms under which Norwegian households allocate their market and domestic labor? Drawing on both a large set of administrative data and a representative survey, this question is examined from two perspectives. First, we focus on the micro-economic processes and investigate if Norwegian households act according to economic rationality or if they still follow the gender norm A man should earn more than his wife. Second, we focus on how Norways contextual factors may influence the household experiences when a wife has better market productivity. We find that a wife with better market productivity, who is thereby facing the risk of outearning her husband, works more hours and earns more than her husband, while doing less choresubehavior consistent with economic rationality. Further analyses show that womens higher relative market productivity is mainly a consequence of having low-income husbands, and higher and lower market productivity women are surprisingly similar in other sociodemographic aspects. Norwegian redistribution policies, through progressive taxation and benefit transfers, seem to mitigate the income differences and promote gender neutrality in a sense that if couples wish to pursue an untraditional division, by preference or by necessity, they seem to be able to do so without being held back by the traditional gender expectations or being very poor.

AB This research contributes to social movement framing theory about frame variation, along with the social problems literature on child protectionism. I extend the theorizing on frames by arguing that frame variation can be a response to new agendas and goals of countermovements and opponents. Specifically, for opponents to rights activism, frame variation can be reaction to the assertion of rights for new protagonists, specifically their entry into new spaces. This study analyzes frame variation of the most deleterious child protectionist claims about stranger danger, assertions that the presence of racial, gender, and sexual others in public spaces will harm children. This paper is a content analysis of political flyers and messages developed by Religious Right campaigns at the state and municipal level between 1974 and 2013; these campaigns framed gay men and transgender woman as threats to children in classrooms and bathrooms. For both gay men and transgender women, these claims were most common at the start of rights advocacy. I argue that challengers make the most overt, deleterious arguments about harm to children when new groups initially advocate for legal rights and access to new spaces; as marginalized groups become more familiar and less strange, challengers make more covert claims about these groups, as stranger danger claims have waning cultural and political resonance.

   DEATH
AB Although suicide and homicide are two of the leading causes of death, theoretical understanding and rigorous quantitative examination of homicide-suicideuthe rare combination of suicide and homicideuare sparse. We ground homicide-suicide in the stream analogy of lethal violence and use three analytical techniques to examine the shared and unique correlates of suicide, homicide-suicide, and homicide. Data come from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), a pooled, cross-sectional time-series database of US victims across 46 states from 2003 to 2013. A logistic regression model with robust standard errors clustered across states and year fixed effects on 105,243 suicide and homicide-suicide cases predicts the odds of homicide-suicide relative to suicide across a range of theoretically informed covariates. A multinomial logistic regression model investigates the factors that distinguish 26,243 appended homicide cases (from the NVDRS) from suicide and homicide-suicide cases. And, an item-response-based statistical approach examines the extent to which homicide-suicide perpetrators are primarily homicidal versus primarily suicidal. Results indicated that interpersonal stressors and criminal history increased, while physical and mental health stressors decreased, the odds of homicide-suicide relative to suicide. In addition, the etiology of homicide-suicide more closely resembled homicide than suicide. Finally, almost one-half of the homicide-suicide cases in our sample were classified as primarily homicidal, while less than one-quarter were classified as primarily suicidal. Findings suggest that homicide-suicide can be conceptualized as a current in the stream analogy of lethal violence, and that the prevention of homicide-suicide would be better facilitated via screening of violence prevention than suicide prevention programs.

TI Consistency and Compensation in Mercy: Commutation in the Era of Mass
   Incarceration
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID PRISON VIOLENCE; GENDER; PUNISHMENT; SENTENCES; JUSTICE; RISK; RACE
AB This multi-method paper presents a model of individual and contextual variation in commutation, a form of clemency that lessens the severity of criminal sentences. In the contemporary US context of high incarceration, commutation is one of few back-end mechanisms available for early release. We first describe national trends, showing a significant decline in commutation releases, as well as great geographic variation. We then test whether commutation decisions reflect consistency or compensation with other forms of punishment. Our mixed-effects logit analysis reveals state-level compensation (greater commutation in more punitive states) but individual-level consistency (greater commutation for more advantaged groups). Commutation is most likely for those presenting a mercy package of White race, female sex, and less violent criminal histories. In contrast, Black men convicted of violence are exceedingly unlikely to be commuted. Nevertheless, qualitative evidence suggests that the apparent female advantage in commutation may reflect differences in the nature of the underlying offense and subsequent prison behavior. These results both parallel and extend sociological research on punishment, pointing to commutation as an understudied and underutilized mechanism for mercy.

AB Sexual concurrency, or having temporally overlapping sexual partnerships, has important consequences for relationship quality and individual health, as well as the health and well-being of others embedded in larger sexual networks. Although married and cohabiting couples have similar, almost universal expectations of sexual exclusivity, the former report significantly lower rates of engaging in sexual concurrency than the latter. Given that this difference in behavior occurs despite similar expectations of sexual fidelity, sexual exclusivity can provide an important test of whether marriage has a causal effect on relationship behavior. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, I estimate an instrumental variable model testing whether observed differences in sexual concurrency between marital and cohabiting relationships are attributable to marriage itself via a recent implementation of the special regressor method, an estimator for binary choice models with endogenous regressors. I find evidence that, relative to cohabitation, marriage reduces the likelihood that an individual will engage in concurrent sexual relationships. Finding an effect of marriage in a recent cohort of young adults suggests that, despite changes in marriage and cohabitation, marriage still influences individual behavior.

   NEIGHBORHOOD; MARRIAGE; REVERSAL; UNEVEN; SCHOOL
AB There has been increasing interest in understanding how macro-level contextual characteristics are associated with intra-couple dynamics, such as intimate partner violence (IPV). I extend this literature by exploring whether contextual changes in womens status are associated with IPV at the couple level. I focus on case studies from four Eastern African countriesuKenya, Malawi, Uganda, and Zimbabweuwhere there were large contextual declines in educational hypergamyua measure of womens statusubetween 2000 and 2010. Using Demographic Health Survey data and a multilevel approach, I find that regional declines in hypergamy are associated with significantly higher probabilities of wives reports of recent intimate partner violence in Kenya, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. These findings are consistent with relative resource theories that predict that gender-status inconsistencies correspond with backlash, although they extend existing theories by looking at the macro level and considering contextual changes in womens status over time. To the contrary, regional declines in hypergamy are associated with significantly lower probabilities of wives reports of recent intimate partner violence in Malawi, which may have to do with a long-standing history of matrilineal norms in this context. The analysis enhances sociological understandings of how contextual changes in gender conditions are associated with micro-level couple outcomes, but also points to important heterogeneity across diverse contexts.

AB Many scholars argue that evangelical Christian beliefs and traditions are central to dominant conceptions of American national identity, but most empirical studies in this area focus on the activities and identities of evangelical Christians themselves. Missing is an assessment of how evangelical-infused understandings of national belonging shape the views of people outside the white evangelical subculture. We analyze how Americans of all religious backgrounds evaluate a secularized evangelical discourse (SED)ua repertoire of political statements that are phrased in religiously nonparticularistic terms, but have roots in evangelical Christian history and epistemologies and have been politicized through social movements and party politics. Using latent class analysis and nationally representative survey data, we identify four prevailing profiles of support for claims about public religious expression anchored in this repertoire: ardent opposition, moderate opposition, moderate support, and ardent support. We find that a majority of Americans, not just evangelicals, respond positively to propositions that employ SED. Consequently, we argue that conservative Christianity influences contemporary politics not only by furnishing individuals with beliefs and identities, but also by providing a durable and flexible source of boundaries around a culturally specific vision of national belonging that resonates far beyond the boundaries of the evangelical subculture.

AB This article explains perceived loneliness among people in Europe by accounting for cultural factors as well as social isolation. Culturally, it measures the impact of both personal and societal individualism-collectivism on loneliness. It accounts for social isolation by looking at the separate effects of living alone, emotional isolation, and relational isolation. Using a 2014 European Social Survey sample comprising 36,760 individuals in 21 countries, the study predicts loneliness using multilevel logistic regression modeling using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation procedures. Results indicate that societal individualism may strongly reduce loneliness, even after taking into account that social isolation partially mediates this relationship. Further, the effects of living alone and relational isolation depend upon whether one is personally an individualist or collectivist. Living alone and relational isolation greatly increase loneliness, and such negative effects are somewhat reduced for individualists. However, individualists are not protected from the negative impacts of emotional isolation at all, and the above moderation effects do not hold for the most severe forms of loneliness. Based on this analysis, the best case for reduced loneliness for individualists and collectivists alike is that they maintain a strong degree of multiple forms of social integration and live in an individualist society.

AB Tax evasion is a problem everywhere, but it is a much bigger policy problem in some countries than it is in others. The Italian government estimates that it loses more than 27 percent of total tax revenue to evasion, whereas the Swedish government estimates their tax gap to be less than 9 percent. What explains this variation? We test for the importance of culturally based attitudes and institutionally structured rules for taxes and benefits through a unique set of cross-national experiments and attitudinal surveys done in multiple locations across Italy, the UK, the United States, and Sweden. Participants in each location were presented with identical conditions based on institutional variations (tax rates, redistribution regimes, benefits) and asked to complete a survey afterward concerning their attitudes toward a number of social and political issues. A mixed-model analysis of the 2,537 subjects in our study reveals consistent influence of institutional scenarios and three attitude scales measuring pro-redistributive ideology, fiscal responsibility, and perceived government competence. Country effects, however, are more mixed and inconsistent.

AB We combine insights from the sociological and psychological traditions of social psychology to examine how status inequality may affect group performance. Specifically, we examine how synergy, that is, performance gains produced through group interaction, is realized in ethnically diverse groups. Research suggests that diverse work groups struggle to capitalize on the strengths of all group members, and in turn, achieve synergy less frequently than homogeneous groups. We examine how an intervention in the status generalizing process affects group members influenceuand how this affects synergistic gains (n = 50). We study these processes over a three-week period of time. In groups that received an intervention in the status generalizing process (experimental condition), racial hierarchy is decreased in weeks 1 and 3ubut inequality remained in baseline groups. Additionally, in week 3, experimental groups achieved synergy more than baseline groups and did not perform worse than baseline groups on any task.

AB In this paper, we develop an institutional movement logics approach to analyze the structure and dynamics of the US social movement field from 1960 to 1995. Using protest event data taken from the Dynamics of Collective Action dataset, we elicit the most salient combinations of issues, tactics, and targets reported to co-occur at protest events in four periods: 1960-1965, 1966-1972, 1973-1987, and 1988-1995. The analysis reveals the existence of six movement logics of varying breadth, flexibility, and stability. We also detect two important shifts in the overall structure of the field, one toward a broad and flexible form of state-centric politics and one toward several differentiated and narrowly defined forms of nonpolitical contention. We find support for two key premises of the institutional movement logics framework, limited diversity, and relative stability within and between logics while showing that a longer time frame offers a window on field dynamics not visible with shorter study time frames. We close by providing suggestions for further research seeking to build on the institutional movement logics approach.

AB The effects of increasing levels of immigration on neighborhood change have long been examined, but questions remain about the effects of immigration on the neighborhood socioeconomic attainments of native-born families. This study draws from prior work to anticipate a residential queuing process that is triggered by immigration. Residential queuing is a social process that is driven by families striving to improve their residential circumstances in a stratified and uncertain urban landscape affected by increasing immigration. Empirically, residential queuing is evaluated over the course of two familial generations as native families respond to changing levels of exposure to foreign-born populations at the census-tract and metropolitan-area level. The results provide support for a historically established residential queuing process based on native avoidance of neighborhoods with increasing concentrations of foreign-born residents in conjunction with greater levels of upward residential mobility in metropolitan areas with increasing shares of foreign-born population. Alternative expectations from within the general queuing perspective are also evaluated: The sidestep perspective anticipates native-born families from poor, especially poor black, neighborhoods to be negatively affected by increasing metropolitan levels of foreign-born population, and the neighborhood revitalization perspective anticipates native-born families from poor neighborhoods to benefit from an increased neighborhood-level presence of immigration. The implications of these findings for immigration effects research and residential stratification are discussed.

AB This study explores the transmission of educational inequality across three generations in the United States. It addresses two common problems in analyses of multigenerational inequality: omitted mechanisms of indirect transmissions through grandparents' early influences on parents, and theoretically problematic tests of direct effects based on non-zero residual grandparent-child associations. The first problem leads to upwardly biased direct effect estimates; analyses that control for parents' attributes and experiences during their own childhood eliminate most grandparent-child educational associations. Conversely, the second problem can obscure direct effects. This study avoids inferring direct effects from residual grandparent-child associations by assessing the explanatory power of measured child attributes that constitute likely mechanisms of direct effects. It finds little evidence of direct effects overall, although there is some indication of direct effects on bachelor's degree attainment among those with the most-educated grandparents. The findings also speak to potential mechanisms of direct and indirect educational transmission.

   EMPLOYMENT; FEMALE; WORK; JOB; REPRESENTATION
AB Sex segregation across jobs is widespread. While numerous studies have investigated how hiring contributes to this phenomenon, scholars disagree on how the gender composition of the set of candidates that firms consider (labor queues) is related to gender disparities in hiring. Theories of gendered organizations posit that organizations will tend to disadvantage females across all jobs, including jobs where females predominate. Other theories suggest that female disadvantage is more localized, and in particular that it is contingent on the sex-typing of the job. Tokenism theories posit that disparities are more acute when individuals are in the position of tokens among those being evaluated. Unique among papers in this area, we examine the relationship between the gender composition of labor queues and the degree of gender disparities in hiring using a sample of 441 firms in the high-tech sector. Importantly, our setting allows us to distinguish between the predictions of theories of sex-typing and the influence of the numeric representation of women and men among those being evaluated (tokenism theories). Our main findings strongly support Kanter's token theory: screeners disadvantage both males and females when screening for positions in which candidates of the opposite gender predominate.

TI Racialized Re-entry: Labor Market Inequality After Incarceration
SO SOCIAL FORCES

DT Article
ID EMPLOYMENT; CONVICTION; EARNINGS; INCOME
AB Why do some people succeed in the labor market after incarceration but others do not? We study the transition from prison to work with data on monthly employment and earnings for a sample of men and women observed for a year after incarceration. More than in earlier research, the data provide detailed measurement of temporary and informal employment and richly describe the labor market disadvantages of formerly incarcerated men and women. We find that half the sample is jobless in any given month and average earnings are well below the poverty level. By jointly modeling employment and earnings, we show that blacks and Hispanics have lower total earnings than whites even after accounting for health, human capital, social background, crime and criminal justice involvement, and job readiness. A decomposition attributes most of the earnings gaps to racial and ethnic inequalities in employment. Qualitative interviews suggest that whites more than blacks and Hispanics find stable, high-paying jobs through social networks. These findings support a hypothesis of racialized re-entry that helps explain the unusual disadvantage of African Americans at the nexus of the penal system and the labor market.

ID RACIAL CLASSIFICATION; INEQUALITY; RACE; IDENTIFICATION
AB We examine sources of indigenous identity in the two countries with the largest indigenous populations in the Western Hemisphere-Mexico and Peru. We find that the size of the indigenous population varies dramatically depending on the measure of indigeneity used, and that using multiple measures captures distinct modes of indigeneity. Using latent class analysis, we find that contemporary indigenous classification clusters around four types, which we characterize as Traditional Indians, Indigenous Mestizos, New Indians, and Non-Indigenous. Traditional Indians tend to be indigenous on virtually all indicators, and they are especially poor, dark, and rural. Indigenous Mestizos tend to speak an indigenous language, but self-identification as indigenous is tenuous. New Indians assert an indigenous identity despite their frequent lack of linguistic knowledge and close indigenous ancestry, and they are as urban, educated, and light-skinned as the Non-Indigenous. The analysis addresses sociological concepts of ethnic boundaries, assimilation, mestizaje, and symbolic ethnicity and discusses the implications of distinct modes of indigenous ethnicity.

AB Using nineteen panels of the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY-79), we construct life-lines characterizing women's childless expectations and fertility behavior. One-quarter of women in the NLSY-79 cohort ever reported an expectation for childlessness but only 14.8 percent of women remain childless. Childless women follow two predominant life course paths: (1) repeated postponement of childbearing and the subsequent adoption of a childless expectation at older ages or (2) indecision about parenthood signaled through vacillating reports of child-less expectations across various ages. We also find that more than one in ten women became a mother after considering childlessness: an understudied group in research on childlessness and childbearing preferences. These findings reaffirm that it is problematic to assign expected and unexpected childlessness labels to the reproductive experience of childless women. In addition, despite their variability over time, childless expectations strongly predict permanent childlessness, regardless of the age when respondents offer them. Longitudinal logistic regression analysis of these childless expectations indicates a strong effect of childbearing postponement among the increasingly selective group of childless women. However, net of this postponement, few variables commonly associated with childlessness are associated with reports of a childless expectation. We thus conclude that the effects of socio-demographic and situational factors on childless expectations are channeled predominantly through repeated childbearing postponement.

AB When siblings have different characteristics-such as different achievement or different gender-how should parents invest in their education? Although many studies have examined issues of parental investment using behavioral data, this research is often hindered by methodological constraints, including endogeneity and an inability to isolate the effects of predictor variables. This article takes an alternative approach by using data from an original, nationally representative survey experiment (N = 3,239). I assess how Americans believe parents should divide educational resources between siblings with different achievement and gender. In doing so, this article is the first to examine normative beliefs surrounding relative achievement, gender, and parental investment in siblings' education. When achievement is the only difference between siblings, respondents believe that lower achievers should receive more hands-on instructional resources and parental school involvement, and higher achievers should receive more resources that enhance cultural capital and support college enrollment. This pattern maps onto the way respondents divide resources between boys and girls. When gender is the only difference between siblings, respondents believe that boys should receive more instructional resources and parental school involvement, while girls should receive more cultural and college resources. When achievement and gender both differ, however, the effect of relative achievement typically crowds out the effect of gender, suggesting that respondents' evaluations of achievement are more persistent than their evaluations of gender. Implications for research on parental involvement in education are discussed.

AB Scholars debate whether human rights treaties and foreign aid are effective in achieving their stated objectives. Using data on more than 100 developing countries over a 20- to 40-year period, we analyze the independent and interactive effects of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and development assistance (general and health-specific) on three population health outcomes: infant mortality rates, life expectancy at birth, and caloric consumption. Pooled OLS and two-way fixed-effects analyses demonstrate that, in conjunction with development assistance for health, being party to the ICESCR improves survival-related outcomes; this is especially true for infant mortality. These findings do not appear to be driven by selection effects (with respect to ICESCR ratification) or simultaneity bias (with respect to aid receipt). In some cases, targeted aid promotes compliance with a human rights treaty that is otherwise difficult to implement; in other cases, ICESCR membership steers aid effects in different directions. Our findings challenge received wisdoms regarding the ineffectiveness of international human rights law and foreign aid.

AB Children in Tanzania live in a variety of family structures, many of which contain related and unrelated non-parental adults. In this article, I use data from the Rufiji Health and Demographic Surveillance System in Tanzania to examine the role of coresident non-parental adults in childrearing. First, I use quantitative demographic data to investigate the association between kin coresidence and child survival, differentiating by lineage. I also examine the role of unrelated coresident adults. Second, I test whether coresident non-parental adults moderate the association between parental absence and child survival. Finally, I draw from qualitative interview data to investigate childrearing practices and beliefs, with a particular focus on parental absence and kin coresidence. I find that, despite the institutionalization of kin caregiving, coresidence with kin is not beneficial, and kin are unable to compensate for parental absence. The two-parent living arrangement is viewed as ideal, although the reality of childrearing in the setting is complex and fluid. While absent parents try to maintain support of their children, such assistance is insufficient in times of health crisis. Kin care for children with absent parents, but their willingness to assist depends on the reason for the absence.

AB Ethno-religious tolerance is crucial for establishing sustainable democracy, which is scarce in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). This study provides an empirically grounded and nuanced critique of Orientalist studies simply pointing at Islam. It presents a systematic analysis of the impact of religious belonging, belief, and behavior on social tolerance in the MENA, based on 32 uniquely synchronized Arab Barometer and World Values surveys. This study's major contributions are that it (a) provides unique empirical insights into the multifaceted impact of religiosity on social tolerance in the region, (b) develops the 3-Bs approach to a context-sensitive framework, and (c) shows that and explains why Islam has both negative and positive influences. The analyses show (i) that the degree to which people identify with their religion has no negative impact on social tolerance, with exception of the few cases in which Islamist forces hold power; (ii) that under "normal" circumstances orthodox-literalist believers are more tolerant towards others, but less so if they feel repressed or threatened in society (which only holds for a few cases); and (iii) that mosque attendance has a negative impact on ethno-religious social tolerance, and this effect is particularly strong if conservative Islamist states coercively regulate religion and its content, such as communication via sermons. All things considered the multifaceted 3-B approach is found to hold well once the MENA-specific aspects and its diverse society-state-religion relations are incorporated as sources of both possible threats and socialization.

AB An individual's identity may not appear to correspond to his or her beliefs and behaviors. Such incongruence may be particularly likely when an identity is stigmatized. We examine this dynamic in the context of atheists. Being an atheist has often been equated with stating a disbelief in God, but this ignores the distinct phenomenon of identifying as an atheist. This study asks what influences the likelihood that an individual will identify as an atheist beyond saying that he or she does not believe in God. Drawing upon research examining the social dynamics of stigma and identity, we hypothesize that having close friends who are atheists will support an individual's own adoption of the atheist label. On the other hand, we hypothesize that the presence of other stigmatized or at least competing identities, beliefs, and behaviors will serve as a barrier to an individual's adoption of the atheist label. These expectations are largely supported in an analysis of unique survey data offering separate measures of atheist self-identification and belief in God. This study provides a framework for future research to examine these dynamics in the context of other identities, particularly those that are stigmatized.

ID SOCIAL-PARTICIPATION; JOB DISPLACEMENT; VOLUNTEER WORK; IMPACT;
   INTEGRATION; GENDER; WELL; TIME; TERM
AB While there is a widespread belief that stable employment is important for social integration, stable employment careers have become less common in America's increasingly complex labor market. Job tenure has dropped, precarious work arrangements have gained prominence, long-term unemployment has spiked, and an increasing share of the jobless are not looking for work. Against this background, we investigate the linkages between labor market experiences and volunteer activities, as an indicator of people's involvement in civic life. We outline a theory on how transitions between labor market states-within, into, and out of the labor force-bring about changes in civic engagement and test our predictions using panel data from the Current Population Survey 2002-2015. Contrary to what much previous research suggests, we find that people who become unemployed are more likely to start volunteering and no more likely to stop. We additionally show that people who leave the labor force altogether (i.e., not having a job nor looking for one) are more likely to stop volunteering. Conversely, entering the labor force, either by securing or searching for a job, is associated with an increase in volunteer activities. We explore the role of motivation and time resources in accounting for these patterns, finding among other things that moving into or out of the most detached labor market state-outside the labor force without any intention to find work-is most consequential for civic engagement. We discuss the implications of our findings for civic democracy in light of ongoing labor market trends.

AB With the expansion of state surveillance and enforcement efforts in recent decades, a growing literature examines how those vulnerable to punitive state contact strategize to evade it. This article draws on in-depth interviews with eighty-three low-income mothers to consider whether and how concerns about Child Protective Services (CPS), a widespread presence in poor communities with the power to remove children from their parents, inform poor mothers' institutional engagement. Mothers recognized CPS reports as a risk in interactions with healthcare, educational, and social service systems legally mandated to report suspected child abuse or neglect. Departing from findings on responses to policing and immigration enforcement, I find that CPS concerns rarely prompted mothers to avoid systems wholesale. Within their system participation, however, mothers engaged in a selective or constrained visibility, concealing their hardships, home life, and parenting behavior from potential reporters. As reporting systems serve as vital sources of support for disadvantaged families, mothers' practices of information management, while perhaps protecting them from CPS reports, may preclude opportunities for assistance and reinforce a sense of constraint in families' institutional interactions.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; UNITED-KINGDOM; COLORADO; PARTICIPATION; HEALTH;
   POLICY; RISE
AB Recent technological innovations in unconventional oil and gas (UOG) production have transformed the global energy landscape. The combination of hydraulic fracturing-commonly referred to as "fracking"-with horizontal drilling in shale plays across the United States has made the nation the top producer of both natural gas and petroleum, after a long hiatus from the top of the list. However, the public is largely marginalized from collective decisions about if, when, and where UOG production should occur. This marginalization occurs via lack of recognition and authentic participation as well as stymied community capacity to make decisions about zoning and regulating UOG production. The purpose of this article is to interrogate the procedural justice consequences of private participation for individual landowners as they: (1) negotiate leases with agents of oil and gas (O&G) companies and (2) work to have lease terms adequately followed by industry. To do this, we draw on over 100 interviews with Colorado and Pennsylvania citizens who have participated in private negotiations with the O&G industry regarding development of their land or minerals. Using these data and an environmental justice lens, we argue that meta-power-the power to structure the conditions of social contexts-frames negotiations between corporate actors and members of the public, shaping the outcomes of these interactions toward development and away from authentic participation by community members.

DT Article
ID CAPITAL-PUNISHMENT; INTERNATIONAL-LAW; VIOLENT CRIME; DETERRENCE;
   BRUTALIZATION; ANOMIE
AB We analyze why domestic homicide rates in a country sending troops into war increase with some international wars, but not others. Drawing from research on the brutalization effect, we first explain how war can have an effect on homicides through individuals learning acceptable behavior from the state. Second, we explain why we observe the brutalization effect with some wars, but not others. We argue that illegitimate wars are associated with increased homicide rates, while state participation in legitimate wars should not affect homicide rates. Pursuing an illegitimate war may serve as a signal to society that norms and morals have been suspended, leading to a period of moral deregulation in the form of anomie. To test our theory, we conduct time-series analyses of data for the United States between 1928 and 2014. After examining the characteristics of eleven international wars pursued by the United States, we find that a brutalization effect occurs when the country engages in illegitimate, but not legitimate, conflicts. We also examine the validity of several potential alternative explanations and provide directions for future research.

AB Is financialization contributing to the slow decline of union density that is occurring across most advanced capitalist countries? Combining insights from literatures on financialization, corporate governance, and comparative political economy, we argue that the growing dominance of finance within advanced capitalism weakens unions through several channels, and plays an important but underappreciated role in the deunionization of national workforces. Using data from 18 advanced capitalist countries over several decades, this assertion is tested against the literature's existing explanations for declining union density. Results from panel regression models suggest that financialization is an important cause of union decline, but that its particular effects vary between different types of advanced capitalism. The study concludes by arguing that financialization creates new interconnections between firms and finance capital, resulting in business practices that ultimately put downward pressure on union densities across advanced capitalist countries.

ID REVOLUTION GENDER; CHILDREN; FAMILY; MOTHERHOOD; CULTURE; MONEY; TIME;
   GAP; DETERMINANTS; REPRODUCTION
AB Social scientists have documented a substantial increase in both mothers' and fathers' time spent with children since the 1960s in the United States. Yet parenting behaviors remain deeply divided by social class and gender, with important implications for the reproduction of inequality. To understand rising parental investments in children and persistent class and gender differences in parenting, popular accounts and academic studies have pointed to an apparent cultural shift toward norms of time-intensive, child-centered parenting, particularly for mothers and among middle-class parents. However, prior research has produced inconclusive evidence relating to social class, gender, and contemporary parenting norms. Using data from an original vignette survey experiment conducted with a nationally representative sample of more than 3,600 parents, this study examines cultural norms related to parenting elementary school-aged children, considering how both social class and gender shape views about good parenting. Results indicate that parents of different social classes express remarkably similar support for intensive mothering and fathering across a range of situations, whether sons or daughters are involved. These findings suggest that cultural norms of child-centered, time-intensive mothering and fathering are now pervasive, pointing to high contemporary standards for parental investments in children.

TI Democracy Misunderstood: Authoritarian Notions of Democracy around the
   Globe
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English

ID ATTITUDES
AB An intriguing phenomenon consists in the fact that widespread support for democracy coexists in many countries with the persistent absence of democracy itself. Addressing this phenomenon, we show that in most places where it exists people understand democracy in ambiguous ways, such that "authoritarian" notions of what democracy means mix with-and even overshadow-liberal notions, in spite of the contradiction between these two notions. Underlining this contradiction, our evidence shows that authoritarian notions of democracy question the authenticity of liberal notions when both are endorsed conjointly. Worse, the evidence further suggests that authoritarian notions reverse the whole meaning of support for democracy, indeed indicating support for autocracy instead. Arguably, this reversal in the meaning of support for democracy lends legitimacy to authoritarian rule, which helps to explain where autocracy endures. Testing alternative explanations of authoritarian notions of democracy, we find that emancipative values are most influential, exerting a two-fold "enlightening" effect in (a) making people recognize the contradiction between liberal and authoritarian notions of democracy and (b) turning them against authoritarian notions. In a nutshell, the prospects of democracy are bleak where emancipative values remain weak.

   FINANCIALIZATION; REDISTRIBUTION; CONSTRAINTS; INEQUALITY; DYNAMICS
AB Complementing the existing partisanship and income distribution literature that focuses on the earnings of all employees, this paper examines the effect of left government partisanship on top managers. Drawing on firm-level top executive compensation data across thirteen advanced industrialized countries, the paper shows that left government partisanship principally leads to lower CEO compensation, either through laws that enhance workers' collective bargaining power vis-a-vis management or laws that allow shareholders to cast proxy votes on executive compensation (i.e., say-on-pay laws). Furthermore, I show that left government partisanship reduces CEO pay more heavily in those firms that more strongly favor labor's competing stakeholders. In particular, left partisanship reduces executive compensation more heavily in firms that set aside more revenue for shareholders, managers, or creditors, that is, firms with higher asset return, stock return, or debt. These findings highlight how the macro-politics of rising top income inequality at the national level interacts with the micro-distributive conflicts at the firm level. In particular, financialization, such as the rise of the shareholder value revolution, may accentuate the impact of partisan politics against top income inequality.

ID RACIAL SEGREGATION; PUBLIC-SCHOOLS; NATIVE FLIGHT; CHOICE; PARENTS;
   DIMENSIONS; STUDENTS; RACE
AB Between-school ability tracking-the assignment of students to different school types based on their prior achievement-is usually associated with increased ethnic segregation across schools. This article argues that stronger between-school ability tracking is not only associated with stronger ethnic sorting into school types, thus increasing segregation. At the same time, it hampers majority flight, majority members' avoidance of exposure to minority members, thus decreasing segregation. To identify the two-fold effect of tracking the article exploits a unique feature of the German secondary school system: regional variation in the strength of between-school ability tracking. Analyses rely on administrative data entailing geocoded information on all secondary schools in Germany in 2008/2009. Results corroborate expectations of a two-fold effect: there is indication that between-school ability tracking increases segregation via more sorting into tracks while at the same time decreasing it via less school sorting within each track and via less spatial sorting. This suggests that school reforms changing tracked school systems into more comprehensive school systems may have a weaker desegregating impact than expected.

AB This research analyzes how living in concentrated poverty during adolescence affects future college outcomes. Using Add Health data and propensity score methods to explore effect heterogeneity, I find that concentrated poverty has little direct impact on college matriculation. It does, however, strongly reduce the odds of graduating from college for adolescents least likely to reside in concentrated poverty. This indicates an advantage-leveling model in which individuals with prior advantages have the most to lose from neighborhood disadvantage during adolescence. I assess neighborhood socialization, school effects, and peer effects as potential explanations for the neighborhood effect. Supporting collective socialization theory, neighborhood economic opportunity and resource deprivation are key aspects of poverty-saturated neighborhoods that influence college graduation odds. Schools also play an important role in the relationship between neighborhoods and college outcomes. Main effects are likely to be causal as they are highly robust to unobserved confounding.

AB Navigating the labor market in today's economy has become increasingly difficult for those without a college degree. In this study, we ask whether and how working-class men and women in the United States are able to secure gains in wages and/or earnings as they transition to parenthood or increase family size. We look closely at child parity, employment behavior (e.g., switching employers, taking on multiple jobs, increasing hours), and occupation in the year after the birth of a child. Using the 2004 and 2008 panels of the Survey for Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we employ fixed-effects models to examine the impact of changing labor market behavior or occupation on wages and earnings after the birth of a child. We find limited evidence that low- and middle-skill men experience a "fatherhood premium" after the birth of a child, conditional on child parity and occupation. For men, nearly all occupations were associated with a "wage penalty" after the birth of a child (parity varies) compared to the service sector. However, overall higher wages in many male-dominated and white-collar occupations make these better options for fathers. For women, we see clear evidence of a "motherhood penalty," which is partly accounted for by employment behaviors, such as switching to a salaried job or making an occupational change.

AB Women who migrate to the United States often face structural and cultural obstacles when joining the workforce. The US-born daughters of these women show considerable upward mobility, yet recent scholarship finds substantial variation in the employment of second-generation women by parental country of origin. This study assesses whether gender traditionalism in the parental country of origin has a persistent effect on the labor force participation of partnered second-generation women in the United States. An analysis of 1995-2015 Current Population Survey data supplemented with parental origin country characteristics finds that gender-traditional behaviors, religions, institutions, and attitudes are each associated with a lower likelihood of female labor force participation (FLFP). We propose that the successful intergenerational transmission of conservative cultural repertoires from the first to the second-generation accounts for these relationships. Conservative religious context is the best overall predictor of lowered second-generation FLFP. However, patriarchal attitudes and institutions in the parental birthplace best account for the participation of women with parental origins in Latin America and the Caribbean, while the effect of religious context is strongest among women with parental origins in Asia and Europe.

AB This study extends macro-structural research on international migration flows by going beyond conventional economic, demographic, and geographic explanations. Prior extensions suggest that migrants are drawn to places where welfare benefits are generous. I test the welfare magnet hypothesis while proposing an alternative explanation for migration: the prospect for inclusion. The analysis uses a comprehensive point-to-point migration dataset for a sample of robust welfare states, the universalist countries of Nordic Europe, and similarly positioned destinations representing other welfare types to examine destinations' commitments to inclusion, humanitarianism, and welfare generosity. Results reveal no evidence for a magnet effect to the most generous welfare states in the world net of other recognized factors, and even suggest a negative influence linked to the region's high cost of living. Migrants are instead drawn by the promise of social and political inclusion, migrating to destinations where co-ethnics have become full-fledged citizens. Additional evidence points to the role of international commitments to humanitarianism in augmenting flows. Findings integrate insights on contexts of immigrant reception with research on migration flows, thus contributing to a political sociology of immigration and citizenship and opening new avenues for research on the determinants of migration to newer, more distant locations.

AB This study of refugee resettlement contributes a novel conceptual framework to the sociology of forced migration. Drawing on interviews with Syrian refugees in their first year of resettlement in Ontario, Canada, we demonstrate how successful sponsorship counters the "non-person" status associated with refugee recognition. During displacement, refugees mobilize their pre-conflict roles to secure self-rescue against forces of conflict. During resettlement, refugees assert their eligibility to exist and authority to act as "persons" in a reception context that challenges the normative authority of their pre-conflict social roles. Refugee-host interactions that affirm pre-conflict social roles provide the basis for shared trust and enhance the experience of resettlement, confirming statuses which counter the structural violence of refugee role confinement.

AB There is growing evidence that incarceration is associated with adverse health outcomes, but little is known about how circumstances surrounding incarceration relate to health. In the present study, we estimate the effect of timing of incarceration on mental health using panel data constructed from the Danish population registry. We exploit a 1994 criminal justice reform as a natural experiment that created exogenous variation in the age at which offenders were first incarcerated: because of policy change, incarceration occurred earlier than it would have otherwise. For the three out of the four mental health outcomes assessed in the study- having undergone psychiatric treatment, being in therapy or consultation, and being charged with the possession of drugs-we found consistent support for the notion that earlier incarceration is more harmful. The study refines our understanding of the collateral consequences of incarceration and it is the first to provide quasi-experimental evidence for the mental health effects of timing of incarceration.

AB The Internet's relatively unfettered transmission of information risks exposing individuals to extremist content. Using online survey data (N = 768) of American youth and young adults, we examine factors that bring individuals into contact with online material advocating violence. Combining aspects of social structure-social learning theory with insights from routine activity theory, we find that exposure to violence-advocating materials is positively correlated with online behaviors, including the use of social media platforms and the virtual spaces individuals frequent. Target antagonism is also correlated with exposure to violence-advocating materials, but guardianship and online and offline associations are not. Finally, feelings of dissatisfaction with major social institutions and economic disengagement are associated with exposure to violent materials online.

AB Although indigenous populations have been subjected to some of the worst forms of institutionalized oppression in the United States, little social science research has sought to understand the day-to-day ethnoracial biases that contemporary Native American populations face. Seeking to expand this knowledge, we present a theoretical framework of the cultural processes of ethnoracial disadvantage experienced by Native American students in predominantly white colleges. Drawing on 65 in-depth interviews with 50 Native students, we identify four cultural processes of disadvantage: derogatory stereotyping, exoticized othering, delegitimation, and assimilation pressures related to cultural hegemony. Intertwined with these processes is the cultural permissibility of ignorance, a willful dearth of knowledge- and lack of accountability for knowledge-about indigenous peoples, traditions, and histories of oppression which enable these biases and exclusions. Students tend to respond to these cultural processes of disadvantage in three ways: educating others, working to disprove stereotypes, and spanning two worlds. We end by discussing how these results help advance theoretical understanding of ethnoracial bias toward indigenous populations and cultural processes of ethnoracial inequality in the United States more broadly.

TI Eating for Taste and Eating for Change: Ethical Consumption as a

LA English
DT Article
ID POLITICAL CONSUMERISM; FOOD; GREEN; DISTINCTIONS; DYNAMICS
AB Under what conditions is ethical consumption a high-status practice? Using unique food consumption survey data on aesthetic and ethical preferences, we investigate how these orientations to food are related. Existing research on high-status food consumption points to the "foodie," who defines good taste through aesthetic standards. And emergent evidence suggests the "ethical consumer," whose consumption is driven by moral principles, may also be a high-status food identity. However, ethical consumption can be practiced in inexpensive and subcultural ways that do not conform to dominant status hierarchies (e.g., freeganism). In order to understand the complex cultural terrain of high-status consumption, we investigate how socioeconomic status (SES) is related to foodie and ethical consumer preferences and practices. Using a k-means cluster analysis of intercept survey data from food shoppers in Toronto, we identify four distinct clusters representing foodies, ethical consumers, ethical foodies, and those whose preferences involve neither aesthetic nor ethical ideals. Through multinomial logistic regression, we find that while high-status consumers can be foodies or ethical consumers, the highest status consumers prioritize ethical and foodie preferences. Respondents' reported shopping locations corroborate the results of the regression analyses. The taste preferences of the highest status consumers are associated with culinary sophistication and moral considerations, suggesting that high cultural capital tastes incorporate aesthetic and ethical dimensions. These results contribute to literature examining how food consumption repertoires can produce and reinforce classed boundaries and to literature on tastes that has focused on aesthetics to the neglect of ethical ideals.

AB How do protest actions succeed in winning public support? In this paper, I theorize how features of protest can persuade citizens to support demonstrators. In particular, I argue that broadcasting an attractive collective identity by means of diverse, worthy, united, numerous and committed participants (dWUNC) triggers supportive reactions of observers through increasing identification with protesters. I test this argument by exposing respondents to manipulated television news items of a protest event in two video vignette experiments. Study 1 scrutinizes the effect of dWUNC displays in an asylum seeker demonstration on a sample of Belgian citizens. Study 2 replicates this design in the US for the Black Lives Matter issue of police brutality. Both studies show predispositions of citizens to strongly affect favorability towards protesters. On top of these potent receiver effects, however, also the dWUNC features prove persuasive. In both experiments, a consistent pattern of feature effects is found: demonstrations that mobilized more diverse participants, who behaved worthy and acted in unison, elicited more supportive reactions. Study 2 adds that these protest feature effects are in part mediated by increasing identification with the demonstrators. The heterogeneity of protest feature effects is explored.

AB Paid work has become more precarious in the recent decades, prompting many conflicts between employers and employees, including struggles over work hours. To better understand these struggles, we provide the first examination of long-term experiences with work hour mismatches (i.e., gaps between the number of hours people prefer to work per week and the number of hours they actually work). Using sequence analysis and nearly two decades of data from the British Household Panel Study, we find heterogeneous but patterned experiences. Nearly everyone has an hour mismatch eventually (typically overemployment), and most people oscillate between having and not having hour mismatches. Existing theoretical accounts anticipate some hour mismatch sequences, but the data contradict several key predictions. Moreover, no account predicts the most dominant pattern: oscillating overemployment. We thus offer a new explanation, which proposes that hour mismatches usually come in waves but can be generated in different ways. Sometimes mismatches are caused by unstable work schedules. Other times, mismatches stem from inflexible work hours or job demands that intentionally or unintentionally prevent employees from altering their work hours to accommodate changing personal needs.

TI Uneven Patterns of Inequality: An Audit Analysis of Hiring-Related
   Practices by Gendered and Classed Contexts

AB Despite women's uneven entrances into male-dominated occupations, limited scholarship has examined whether and how employers in different occupational classes unevenly discriminate against women during early hiring practices. This article argues that intersecting gendered and classed features of occupations simultaneously shape hiring-related practices and generate uneven patterns of inequality. Using data derived from comparative white-collar (N = 3,044 resumes) and working-class (N = 3,258 resumes) correspondence audits and content-coded analyses of more than 3,000 job advertisements, the author analyzes early hiring practices among employers across two gendered occupational dimensions: (1) sex composition (male- or female-dominated jobs) and (2) gender stereotyping (masculinized or feminized jobs, based on the attributes that employers emphasize in job advertisements). Broadly, findings suggest a polarization of early sorting mechanisms in which discrimination against female applicants is concentrated in male-dominated and masculinized working-class jobs, whereas discrimination against male applicants at early job-access points is more widespread, occurring in female-dominated and feminized jobs in both white-collar and working-class contexts. Interestingly, discrimination further compounds for male and female applicants depending on the classed context when these occupational dimensions align in the same gendered direction (e.g., male-dominated jobs that also have masculinized job advertisements). These findings have implications for the study of gender and work inequality and indicate the importance of a multidimensional approach to hiring-related inequality.

TI A Rare Case of Gender Parity in Academia

   BIAS; PUBLICATION; SCIENTISTS; INEQUALITY
AB In academia, women trail men in nearly every major professional reward, such as earnings, publications, and funding. Bibliometric studies, however, suggest that citations are unique with regard to gender inequality: female penalties have been reported, but gender parity or even female premiums are routinely documented as well. Two questions follow from this puzzle. First, does gender matter for citations in sociology and neighboring social science disciplines? No theoretically informed study of gender and citations exists for the social science core. We begin to fill this gap by analyzing roughly 10,000 publications in economics, political science, and sociology. In contrast to many big data studies, we estimate the effect of author gender on citations alongside other author-, article-, journal-, and (sub)field-level predictors. Our results strongly suggest that when male and female authors publish articles that are comparably positioned to receive citations, their publications do in fact accrue citations at the same rate. This finding raises a second question: Why would gender matter "everywhere but here"? We hypothesize that the answer is related to the mechanisms (e.g., self-selection, biased assessments of commitment) that are activated in the context of some professional rewards but not citations. We discuss why a null gender finding should not be discarded as an anomaly but rather approached as an analytical opportunity.

TI Gender Inequality in Product Markets: When and How Status Beliefs
   Transfer to Products
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID PRIOR KNOWLEDGE; IMPACT; BIASES; JOB; MEN
AB This paper develops and evaluates a theory of status belief transfer, the process by which gender status beliefs differentially affect the evaluations of products made by men and women. We conduct three online experiments to evaluate this theory. In Study 1, we gathered 50 product categories from a large online retailer and had participants rate each product's association with femininity and masculinity. We find evidence of the pervasiveness of gender-typing in product markets. In Studies 2 and 3, we simulate male-typed and female-typed product markets (craft beer and cupcakes, respectively). In the male-typed product market, a craft beer described as produced by a woman is evaluated more negatively than the same product described as produced by a man. Consistent with our predictions, we further find that if the beer is conferred external status via an award, the evaluation of the beer made by a woman improves by a greater magnitude than the same beer made by a man. In the female-typed product market of cupcakes, the producer's gender does not affect ratings. Together, the two studies provide evidence of an asymmetric negative bias: products made by women are disadvantaged in male-typed markets, but products made by men are not disadvantaged in female-typed markets. These studies also provide compelling evidence of status belief transfer from producers to their products. We draw out the implications of these findings and suggest ways that gender biases in product markets can be reduced.

AB This study connects two lines of research trend studies on social change in housework time and life-course studies on individual- and couple-level change in housework time. This novel approach allowed us to link the macro-level trend of gender convergence in housework time to the micro-level mechanisms underlying it. Using long-running panel data (SOEP), we implemented a cohort-sequence design that followed two birth cohorts (1960 and 1975) of West German men and women from age 25 until age 40. Regression and decomposition methods yielded four central findings. First, the gender gap in housework time narrowed by 40 percent from the 1960 cohort to the 1975 cohort. Second, women's cohort declines in housework time unfolded with age, as the steep life-course increase found in the 1960 cohort leveled off in the 1975 cohort. Men's increases in housework time were constant across the age range studied. Third, an extensive set of time-varying indicators for absolute and relative resources, union formation, fertility, and household conditions accounted for 77 percent of cohort changes in women's housework time but only for 12 percent of changes in men's housework time. In total, the covariates considered in our models explained 55 percent of gender convergence from the 1960 cohort to the 1975 cohort. Fourth, individual age trajectories underlying this trend remained mostly unexplained, notably women's shift from a steep rise to a flat line. We conclude that life-course factors driving change in housework time may still hold potential for further gender convergence.

AB After more than a century of convergence, the economic fortunes of rich and poor regions of the United States have diverged dramatically over the last 40 years. Roughly a third of the US population now lives in metropolitan areas that are substantially richer or poorer than the nation as a whole, almost three times the proportion that did in 1980. In this paper I use counterfactual simulations based on Census microdata to understand the dynamics of regional divergence. I first show that regional divergence has primarily resulted from the richest people and places pulling away from the rest of the country. I then estimate the relative contributions to regional divergence of two major socioeconomic trends of recent decades: the sorting of people across metro areas by income level and the national rise in income inequality. I show that the national rise in income inequality is sufficient on its own to account for more than half of the observed divergence across regions, while income sorting on its own accounts for less than a quarter. The major driver of regional economic divergence is national-level income dispersion that has exacerbated preexisting spatial inequalities.

AB Classical and recent accounts of education posit that education legitimately, and authoritatively, classifies individuals to positions of lower or higher status. However, despite these general theoretical claims, empirical evidence that provides an in-depth picture of the relationship between educational attainment and social status remains scarce. In this paper, based on a dataset of 31 countries (International Social Survey Programme), we investigate the extent to which education is related to subjective social status, the degree to which this is seen as legitimate, and how this relationship varies between countries. We contextualize this relationship with the influence of the centrality of education in countries (operationalized as the share of higher educated). Results showed that education is an important source of subjective social status for individuals across all countries, and is seen as relatively legitimate and uncontroversial among all educational groups. Moreover, among those who perceive education to be more important for status, subjective status differences between educational groups are larger. Additionally, in countries with larger shares of higher educated, educational differences in subjective social status correlate more strongly with whether or not people obtained a degree of higher (tertiary) education. Lastly, the relationship between education and subjective social status in these countries is more independent from other sources of status, such as income and gender. It therefore seems to be that as higher education becomes more central and widely shared in a society, rather than leveling social differences, ironically it also becomes more distinctive and diagnostic in distinguishing people along group lines.

AB Despite the emerging literature on multigenerational stratification beyond two generation models, our understanding of how disadvantages are transmitted over multiple generations at the bottom of the socioeconomic hierarchy is limited, with the lack of data on the extremely disadvantaged. We fill this research gap by investigating the legacy of the nobi system, a system by which individuals were treated as property and owned by the government or private individuals, upon social mobility across four generations. The formal abolition of the nobi system in 1801 provides an opportunity to assess the extent to which nobi great-grandfathers still mattered for great-grandsons' upward mobility, more than six decades after the dismantling of the system. Korean household registers, which were compiled every three years during 1765-1894 in two villages on Jeju Island and incorporated a variety of individual demographic and social status information, allow us to link families across generations. We identify the social status of adult males recorded in 1864-94 registers as well as that of their fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers. Logistic regression results show that the odds of attaining high status were substantially lower for adult males whose great-grandfathers were nobis than for those whose great-grandfathers held high- or middle-status positions, even after controlling for the social statuses of fathers and grandfathers. Despite the abolition of the nobi system and the rapid expansion of high-status positions throughout the nineteenth century, the upward mobility of descendants of nobi great-grandfathers was considerably restricted, revealing the continuity of disadvantages over multiple generations.

AB We studied the impact of an individual's family and community background on their voting propensity in the 2015 Finnish parliamentary elections by employing a sibling design on an individual-level register-based dataset. The results showed that a quarter of the total variance in voter turnout was shared between siblings. Considering the dichotomous nature of the turnout variable, this implies that background has a strong effect which is almost comparable to sibling similarity in education. Parental socioeconomic position and voting, in turn, are equally important factors by explaining one-third of this shared part of the likelihood of voting. Mothers and fathers make roughly equal contributions. The results suggest that future studies of inter-generational effects in political participation, whenever possible, should use information from both maternal and paternal characteristics and multiple indicators of parental socioeconomic position simultaneously. We conclude by underlining that as people cannot choose their background, voting propensity is strongly influenced by factors beyond an individual's own control, which is problematic for the functioning of inclusive democracy and equality of opportunity.

AB Social networks of family and friends are key resources that individuals turn to in times of need. When family and friends can provide assistance, they constitute a form of social capital that individuals may draw on for social support. Although a large body of research has examined the use of social support in its own right and as a predictor or moderator of other outcomes, few studies have explored differentials in access to social support for the general population or how these access levels have changed over time. There are many open questions. Is access to social support broadly distributed in the population or does it differ by demographic subgroups? Have levels of access remained constant? We compare levels of access to social support through both family and friends across population subgroups and describe the changing contours of access to it in the general population. Using repeated cross-sectional measurements that we compile from nearly two decades of surveys conducted as part of the Survey of Income and Program Participation, we expand on a literature that has, to date, focused almost exclusively on the use of social support as a predictor of other outcomes using non-representative data. This article presents, to our knowledge, the first nationally representative study of stratification and trends in access to social support for individuals in the United States.

AB Although family and friends can drain a household's finances by requesting personal loans, lenders have proven savvy in how they respond to such requests. Beyond identifying the importance of sincerity tests for curtailing the pressure to help others in one's social circle, the studies of negative social capital do not address why the pressure to lend varies according to the dramaturgical performance strategies of the benefactors. In other words, how do potential lenders manage to say no without saying no? Using interview evidence from clients at the Mission Asset Fund in California, we show how individuals engage in obfuscatory relational work, performing a self that evades the taboo of greedy callousness, while sometimes telling half-truths about not being able to help in the way borrowers would like. Unlike the concept of obfuscatory relational work, however, we focus on expected transfers that do not happen and on unreciprocated gifts that are disguised as loans. The lender and recipient are engaged in face-saving obfuscation; but in the first case, the lender presents a generous self that is emotionally close to the borrower; in the second, the lender helps the recipient of the gift maintain face by avoiding an awkward ask, pretending the "loan" is expected to be repaid. This paper outlines different strategies of obfuscation among adults trying to improve their financial lives and the contingencies at play as a ruse is abandoned in favor of a direct refusal to lend.

AB This paper proposes that CEO dismissal is a form of penalty that CEOs incur for their record of deviation from historically prevailing norms of appropriate behavior during performance downturns. To verify this argument, I examine CEO dismissal and post-dismissal strategic change in large U.S. companies between 1984 and 2007, when the field in which these firms were embedded was characterized by the prominence of the norms of corporate restructuring for shareholders. My findings are three-fold. First, the effect of performance declines on CEO dismissal was intensified by the extent to which CEOs held a record of deviation from the norms of restructuring i.e., that of increasing assets, employees, and unrelated diversification. Second, new CEOs were more inclined to engage in restructuring when they took office following the dismissal of predecessors with a record of deviation. Finally, those patterns of CEO dismissal and post-dismissal restructuring became more evident over time as the norms developed. Meanwhile, the findings did not apply prior to the shareholder value era. Consequently, this paper suggests that institutional norms act as interpretive frameworks that enable a board of directors to make sense of performance problems and evaluate managerial competence to resolve those problems. Implications for the literatures on institutional theory and upper echelon research are discussed.

   DYNAMICS
AB payday lenders, check cashers, and other "alternative" financial services (AFS) have garnered attention from policymakers and advocates for the poor because they are more expensive than traditional banking constituting what some call a "Ghetto Tax." This is the first study to explore neighborhood-level AFS geography on the national scale. Leveraging a dataset comprising the universe of AFS in 2015, I show that not only are there substantial differences in AFS presence between white and non-white neighborhoods, but that these disparities are largest in the most segregated metropolitan areas. This finding supports theories that racial segregation creates easily identifiable markets for institutions to avoid, target, and exploit. I further show that while AFS presence declines with neighborhood income, the gap between black and white neighborhoods is widest among high-income neighborhoods, reflecting the unique vulnerability of even affluent blacks to institutional marginalization. This work documents how the overlapping geographies of racial isolation and AFS prevalence shape the very cost of money for different racial groups, illustrating the importance of institutions transmitting the effects of racial isolation.

   MIGRATION; OUTCOMES; LIVES; CITIZENSHIP; SELECTIVITY
AB Legal status is a growing dimension of inequality among immigrants in the U.S. Scholars have suggested that the legal status with which immigrants enter the country stratifies their short- and long-term opportunities for labor market integration. However, much quantitative immigration scholarship modeling the relationship between legal status and labor market integration treats legal status as static. In reality, immigrants change statuses dynamically throughout their lives. This article uses a dynamic conceptualization of legal status, as well as nationally representative data and regression and propensity score weighting techniques, to examine whether five initial legal statuses are associated with divergent labor market trajectories even after those statuses change. I find that initial legal statuses which I refer to as starting points are associated with ordered differences in immigrants' occupational positions immediately after immigrants change status to lawful permanent residence. These differences persist over time. Five years after all immigrants share lawful permanent residence, employment visa holders maintain more prestigious jobs; immigrants with family reunification and diversity status are in the middle; and immigrants with refugee status and undocumented experience have less prestigious jobs. This article demonstrates aggregate, longitudinal patterns of stratification among a nationally representative sample of permanent residents. The findings suggest the importance of modeling legal status as a dynamic rather than static category to reflect the continued influence of legal status starting points on immigrants' labor market integration.

AB The transition to adulthood is increasingly characterized by complex paths into the world of work and family, especially for young women. Yet how work and family combine to influence stress among young adult women is not well understood. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we leverage new extensions to latent class analysis (LCA) to identify common combinations of work and family circumstances among young adult women, their earlier life and contemporaneous correlates, and associations with two stress measures: a multi-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Epstein Barr Viral (EBV) antibody titers, a well-validated biomarker of stress-related immunity impairments. We identify seven different common combinations of latent work family combinations among young adult women ranging from well-compensated professional workers with and without children, mothers without paid employment, and delayed transitions to work and family. Completing a college degree was associated with a higher likelihood of membership in classes marked by professional work irrespective of motherhood, while being raised in a community with greater female labor opportunities was generally associated with membership in child-free classes. Mothers and child-free women in "pink-collar" work with low wages and decision-marking freedom reported higher stress compared to women in "white-collar" work with higher wages and decision-making freedom. These differences are mostly attenuated following adjustments for poverty-related stressors and work family conflict. While prior work has emphasized the health benefits for women of combining work and family, our research suggests these benefits may be limited to women of higher socioeconomic status with flexible, well-compensated jobs.

AB Public support for environmental protection has evinced declines in recent years that are widely attributed to growing antipathy among self-identified Republicans. Fractures in what was long considered broad and enduring support for the environment in the United States have called attention to the broader socio-political context in which individual opinion on the environment is formed, and especially the role of political parties and their leaders in shaping opinion. Empirical analyses of environmental support, however, remain strongly focused on individual-level correlates of support. We apply recent methodological advances in age-period-cohort models to scrutinize changes in Americans' willingness to pay more for environmental protection between 1973 and 2014. Analyses distinguish the importance of individual traits, such as political identification, from cohort and especially period-based fluctuations that result from changing economic and political conditions. Individual-level covariate results are reflective of previous research on environmental opinion (e.g., age is negatively and education positively associated with environmental support). We further find that political context across time periods matters as much as, and interacts with, individual political affiliation to influence support for the environment. Americans of all political stripes demonstrate decreases in support for environmental spending during Democratic presidential administrations and during difficult economic times. Declines during Democratic presidencies are especially pronounced among Republicans. Analyses also highlight parallels between the high levels of political polarization in environmental support found at the end of the Obama Presidency and the end of the Carter era.
