AB Recent scholarship suggests theta new form of low-quality, contingent self-employment is taking hold in postindustrial economies. Using longitudinal data on men fr am the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the German Socio-Economic Panel, I find that on average men in Germany and the U.S. do not fare poorly in self-employment and in both countries a substantial number of new self-employment jobs offer prospects for earnings and stability that rival the wage-and-salary sector. However, there is far more variability in the U.S., with a higher proportion of self-employment jobs ranking among the best and the worst new jobs in the labor market. New entrepreneurs benefited more in the U.S. than in Germany from exploiting the demand for skilled postindustrial services in the self-employment market At the same time, loosely structured labor markets and weaker worker protections contributed to a larger proportion of low-paying and unstable self-employment jobs in the U.S.

AB Among young household heads, black women are employed at lower rates than white women, following a pattern found among young men. The current article investigates whether theories of industrial restructuring account for the lower employment rates among young black women heading households. In particular, I investigate whether processes involving deindustrialization, spatial mismatch, and skills mismatch lead to different employment outcomes for white and black women. I find that young female household heads who reside in the central city experience a drop in employment with increases in the suburbanization of low-skill jobs. In addition, young black women are losing employment from the relative expansion of retail trade industries, while young white women are not.

AB While the effect of parenthood on women's work has been well documented little attention has been given to the potentially important link between work and parenthood for men. Two competing models of fatherhood suggest opposite effects of having children on work activities. The "good-provider" model predicts that fathers will work more than nonfathers, while the involved-father model predicts that fatherhood might encourage men to work less. We use data from the 1992-93 National Survey of Families and Households to examine the effect of parenthood on married men and women's employment and work hours. Findings indicate evidence for both models.

ID RATES
AB The findings of two "between-columns" tests of the theory linking status integration and the suicide rate (Stafford & Gibbs 1985, 1988) suggest that only occupational integration is relevant However, in numerous "within-column" tests there is a substantial negative association between marital integration and the suicide rate among marital statuses within each age group. The present research demonstrates that the substantial negative association holds generally for six age groups of black females, black males, white females, and white males in the U.S., even when the amount of occupational integration for each marital status is taken into account Hence, although the theory's predictive accuracy would exceed that of contenders even if limited to occupational integration the findings caution against exclusion of marital integration.

DT Article
ID SOUTHERN SUBCULTURE; VIOLENCE; CULTURE; POVERTY
AB Replication of the Nisbett-Reaves test of the herding-culture-of-honor hypothesis fails to support expectations derived from om Nisbett's culture-of-honor theory. The theory predicts that violent culture has economic advantage infrontier areas with herding economies, because there is a chronic threat of livestock theft. Nisbett and Reaves hypothesize that rural counties in the South, where ecological conditions promote livestock herding, will have especially high white non-Hispanic male homicide rates. Our statistical analysis reproduces the mean homicide rates reported by previous research, but indicates that they are artifacts of skewed distributions, unreliable estimates of homicide rates, and the failure to control for differences in the distribution of white poverty.

AB Considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the social, economic, and cultural forces that produced the Great Migration and to describing the success of southern African American migrants upon their arrival in the North. In contrast relatively little research has examined the settlement pattems of southern migrants. This article uses the 1970 Neighborhood Characteristics;Public Use Microdata Sample to determine whether migrants were more likely than northern-born blacks to reside in neighborhoods that (1) were more highly segregated (2) had more families living in poverty, and (3) were characterized by higher levels of family instability. The results reveal that, on average, recent migrants from the South resided in the "best" neighborhoods, that past migrants were located in the "worst" neighborhoods, and that northern-born blacks fell between the two migrant groups. Recent migrants also received the greatest locational returns to human capital characteristics such as education and employment.

AB Using data from the 1990 Public Use Microdata Sample, this article examines the sources of differentials between immigrants and natives in interstate migration in the 1985-90 period Three sets of factors are evaluated to determine whether they account for differences between immigrants of different origins and natives: individual human capital, social capital of nativity groups, and economic conditions in state of residence. The analysis shows that while human capital factors are the most important sources of differences between immigrants and natives in internal migration patterns, contextual dimensions associated with the social capital of nativity groups and state economic conditions also strongly influence interstate migration of immigrants.

AB The emerging labor market stratification and crime perspective has drawn on dual labor market theory and social control theory to examine the influence of labor market stratification and resulting job characteristics on criminal behavior. With empirical studies finding consistent support for this relationship, it has been suggested that parents' work experience may also influence their children's law-violating behavior Using data from the National Survey of Families and Households, the current research examines whether parents' job characteristics, indicative of the primary- and secondary-sector labor market division influence children's bonds to conformity and resulting levels of delinquency The findings suggest that parents' job characteristics have significant effects on levels of parental supervision children's feelings of attachment and efficacy, as well as educational aspirations and grade point averages, all of which directly or indirectly affect levels of delinquency.

AB Recent theories addressing the impact of neighborhood socioeconomic status on family formation are integrated with a broader theoretical literature specifying the conditions under which local neighborhood conditions influence social behavior in order to develop hypotheses relating neighborhood disadvantage to the timing of first marriage. Event-history analyses of data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics for 1969-93 show that, among whites, residing in a disadvantaged neighborhood hastens the entry into first marriage, while among blacks, neighborhood disadvantage delays marital entry. Among whites the positive impact of neighborhood disadvantage on marriage probabilities declines with age. Among blacks, the inverse effect-of neighborhood disadvantage on marital timing declines with length of residence in the neighborhood. Only among white males does the impact of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage decline significantly between 1969 and 1993. Moreover, for white males, the effect of neighborhood SES is weaker for metropolitan than for nonmetropolitan residents and is stronger for long-term than for short-term neighborhood residents.

AB We use the 1996 General Social Survey (GSS) to explore racial differences in perceptions of the etiology and treatment of mental illness. We find that African Americans are more likely than whites to reject the idea that mental illnesses are caused by either genetics or an unhealthy family upbringing, but this effect does not extend to other biological or environmental explanations of psychological disorders. We propose that blacks may be more skeptical than whites of genetic- and family-based explanations because of their resemblance to arguments that have been used to criticize blacks and justify their disadvantaged structural position. Additionally, we find that racial differences in etiological beliefs play a substantial part in explaining African Americans' tendency to have more negative attitudes than whites toward professional mental health treatment These findings suggest not only that etiological beliefs may reflect broader political debates about race but also that these beliefs may be at the care of some of the differences in the attitudes of blacks and whites toward professional help-seeking.

AB Voluntary association researchers typically rely on cross-sectional data to demonstrate that individual membership varies across life cycle stages. The life cycle and membership, however, are more appropriately treated as dynamic processes. This research recognizes the dynamic nature of these processes by exploring the influence of transitions to marriage and parenthood on the joining and leaving rates of voluntary associations. Event history techniques are used to analyze retrospective data from a probability sample of 1,050 individuals. Separate models are estimated for males and females while additional analyses disaggregate joining and leaving rates by group type. Results demonstrate that the effects of life cycle transitions on rates are gendered and suggest that relationships consistently reported in moss-sectional analyses result from differences in underlying joining and leaving rates.

TI Is law the rule? Using political frames to explain cross-national
   variation in legal activity
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Review
ID STATE; PSYCHOLOGY; PUNISHMENT; DEMOCRACY; CULTURES
AB Across democratic countries, amounts of individualistic legal activity are starkly different. The current trend in explaining this variation is to break legal activity into different categories and explain why variation exists within each type While this trend has been useful in providing detailed analyses across a narrow spectrum of activities, it moves the field away from the broader context in which all legal activity occurs. I take the opposite tack here, considering myriad types of legal activity at once. This study first finds that across nation-states, levels of many different types of legal activity are correlated with each other. Using a structural equation model and OLS regression equations, I then demonstrate that state decentralization and state/society interpenetration i.e, the lack of a clear boundary between the state and civil society, tend to fuel individualistic legal activity The implication. is that changing individual incentives to engage in legal activity may fuel social change in some national contexts but not others, and that such contextual effects are predictable.

AB Occupational mobility trend is compared using SSIC versus Prestige and SEI scales. A preliminary survey of what occupational scales measure leads to a contrast between older, normative scales and a norm-independent conception of occupational dominance Dominance may be assessed by three convergent algorithms that assess relative rank by taking averages over origins and destinations. These are shown, to a good approximation, to be averages over advantage, no matter how advantage is indexed. Data from the OCGII and subsequent NORC General Social Survey are analyzed. The dominance results replicate as consistent contrasts with SEI. Trend is summarized as nondecreasing and quite possibly increasing intergenerational rigidity. Tentative evidence of a big shake-up after 1986 is presented. The declining role of education in access to rank and as mediator of ascription is described.

AB Although scientists from various disciplines stress the importance of estimating random measurement error; these discussions have little effect on experimenters who do behavioral sociological research. There have been two important results: (i) many experimenters continue to adopt a laissez-faire approach to measurement error, and (ii) there are very few discussions that illustrate its practical importance in laboratory research. In this article I examine the role of abstract measurement theory in modern experimental sociology giving particular emphasis to the improvement of data analysis and theory building I detail the cause and effect of random measurement error in the laboratory and review how the reliability of behavioral data is estimated and interpreted. Discussed are issues of statistical pointer, Type I and Type II errors, internal and external validity, and the prospects for cumulative theory.

TI Reframing the migration question: An analysis of men, women, and gender

ID UNITED-STATES; IMMIGRATION; FAMILY; CONSTRAINTS; NETWORKS
AB The migration literature agrees on several key factors that motivate individual decisions to move: human capital investments, socioeconomic status, familial considerations, social networks, and local opportunities in places of origin relative to opportunities abroad. Yet further analysis of the social forces underlying these relationships reveals interwoven gender relations and expectations that fundamentally differentiate migration patterns, in particular who migrates and why. Data analysis of 14,000 individuals in 43 Mexican villages reveals several mechanisms through which the effects of gender play out in the migration process. Results suggest that migrant networks provide support to new men and women migrants alike, whereas high female employment rates reduce the likelihood that men, but not women, begin migrating. Education effects also emphasize the importance of examining gender differences. In keeping with the literature on Mexican migration, I find that men are negatively selected to migrate but, conversely, that higher education increases migration among women. My findings also question the narrow portrayal of women as associational migrants that follow spouses disclosing much greater chances of family, separation than reunification among migrants' wives and significantly higher migration risks for single and previously married women than married women.

AB This article combines status attainment research with research on values and beliefs to understand educational stratification in Kenya. With household survey data, I examine the impact of family background and structure, division of household labor, and parental perceptions on children's educational participation. Parents' expectations for future Financial help from children and perceptions of labor-market discrimination against women are significant determinants of children's enrollment. Patriarchal norms and child labor have no effect. Educational inequalities are better understood as due to the evaluation of returns to education and household resource constraints than as due to gender stereotypes or reliance on child labor. The results challenge traditional explanations of educational inequality in less industrialized societies and suggest that policies to spark school demand in developing countries may be misguided.

AB While prior research demonstrates that living in a socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhood increases young women's risk of premarital childbearing, few studies have explored the mechanisms that account for this effect. And few, studies have tested Wilson's (1987) hypothesis that the pronounced racial difference in premarital childbearing can be attributed largely to racial differences in neighborhood environments. Using longitudinal data from the National Survey of Children, we find that over one-third of the positive effect of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage on the timing of young women's first premarital birth can be attributed to the attitudes and behaviors of peers and to young women's more tolerant attitudes toward unmarried parenthood in distressed communities. A smaller proportion of the effect of neighborhood socioeconomic status on adolescent premarital childbearing can be attributed to higher rates of residential mobility in poor neighborhoods. Despite their centrality to theories of neighborhood effects, adolescents' educational aspirations school attachment, and parental supervision do little to mediate the impact of community disadvantage on adolescent childbearing. We also find that about two-thirds of the racial difference in the risk of premarital childbearing can be explained by racial differences in neighborhood quality.

AB We analyze survey data from 23, largely industrialized countries on attitudes toward married women's employment at four stages of the family life course. Despite general consensus between countries, cluster and correspondence analyses show that the nations represent three distinct patterns of attitudes. There is only mixed support for the hypothesis that public opinion conforms to state welfare regime type. Instead normative beliefs reflect both a general dimension of structural and cultural factors facilitating female labor force participation and a life course dimension specific to maternal employment. Men and women largely agree, but gender differences affect cluster membership for a few countries. Systematic analysis of a large number of countries helps to test; the limits of comparative typologies and to identify anomalous cases for closer study.

AB Using a longitudinal design that links a sample of southern-reared African American men to their childhood census records (collected in 1920), this study attempts to replicate recent findings documenting the influence of skin color on the socioeconomic attainment of African Americans. The childhood census records used in this study classify African Americans as either black or mulatto, allowing for a unique investigation of color stratification in adult life. Consistent with previous research, findings point to the importance of phenotypic characteristics in influencing the life chances of African Americans. Subjects identified as mulatto enjoyed modestly higher adult socioeconomic status compared with subjects identified as black. While the mulatto advantage attenuates slightly once origin characteristics are considered multivariate results indicate that differences in social origins are responsible for only 10 to 20 percent of the color gap in adult attainment. Findings suggest that color bias (colorism) rather than family background may be responsible for the bulk of color differences in the socioeconomic status of African American men.

AB Using four years of county-level data drawn from the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) for South Carolina and a pooled moss-sectional time-series research design, we investigate whether gun availability is related to violent crime, gun mime, juvenile gun crime, and violent crimes committed with ct knife. We contribute to the literature by distinguishing between illegal and legal gun availability and by using a comprehensive measure of gun mime Results show a strong positive relationship between illegal gun availability and violent crime, gun mime and juvenile gun mime. Little or no effect for the legitimate gun availability measure is observed in any of the estimated models. Findings also reveal that illegal guns have little influence on violent mimes committed With a knife. Offenders seem not to be substituting knives or other cutting instruments when illegal firearms become less available. A supplemental analysis also indicates no evidence of simultaneity between gun availability and violent crime. The strong and consistent effect of illegal rather than legal gun availability on violent mime has important policy implications, because it suggests that greater attention should be directed at devising ways far legitimate gun owners to better secure their weapons.

AB This research investigates the impact of structural conditions on rates of black and white homicide for different regions of the U.S. Particular attention is given to the claim that significant changes have occurred in regional patterns of homicide, shifting attention away from the South and toward the western region. Based on race-specific homicide rates for U.S. cities in 1990, our research provides statistical evidence of similarities in mean race-specific homicide rates for the southern and western regions. While this finding suggests greater comparability, further exploration reveals that the similarities in regional homicide rates cannot be attributed to like circumstances or conditions once methodological pursuits of invariant structural covariates in research prevail. Given the presence of unique structural disadvantages in each of these regions, we offer explanations for the differences in structural and cultural forces that contribute to the race-specific homicide rates.

AB In this article, we extend the literature on adolescent delinquency by offering a theoretical framework that integrates insights from labor-market and stratification research on the one hand and microlevel family and criminological research on the other. Analyses draw from local labor-market data and nationally representative longitudinal survey data on adolescents and employ techniques that take into account clustering within hierarchical structures. Findings suggest strong effects of low-wage service-sector concentration and unemployment on the likelihood of both fighting and drug use among adolescents. Consistent with our emphasis on potential mediating processes, we find that these effects are partially produced through the patterning of family, income, family intactness, and adolescent attachment to parents and school. An interesting finding is that low-wage service-sector size and unemployment effects on adolescent delinquency persist even with potential mediators controlled. We conclude by discussing these persistent effects and their implications.

AB Despite recent gains in educational and occupational achievement, black Americans are still worse off than whites across a broad range of quality-of-life indicators. In this article we analyze survey data on volunteering, which show that whites volunteer more than blacks. We ask how much of this difference is due to the way human capital is distributed in the population. We then develop a resource theory of volunteering that acknowledges that, besides human capital, social and cultural resources play a role in making volunteer work possible Black Americans tend to be better endowed with these kinds of resources than whites, which partially compensates for their shortage of human capital However, blacks are less likely than whites to be asked to volunteer and less likely to accept the invitation if it is made. In the second stage of our analysis, we ask whether there are different pathways to volunteering for blacks and whites. We find that, for all kinds of volunteering except the entirely secular, black volunteering is more influenced by church attendance than is white volunteering, a reflection of the more prominent role of the black church in its community, while socioeconomic differences have a smaller impact on black volunteering Among volunteers for secular activities, church attendance has a negative effect on volunteering, but only for whites.

SO SOCIAL FORCES

ID WAGE
AB A state-level index of the conditions that Herrnstein and Murray suggest tightened the relationship between IQ and statics in the past century as well as a measure of "credentialing by examination" are used to try to explain interstate variation in the association between IQ and status attainment circa 1990. The results contradict Herrnstein and Murray's interpretation and provide support for an alternative credentialing argument. The more a state uses written, IQ-like examinations as screening devices for occupational access, the stronger the relationship between IQ and income. Thus, rather than higher IQ leading to status attainment because it indicates skills needed in a modern society, IQ may reflect the same test-taking abilities used in artificial screening devices by which status groups protect their domains.

AB Three aspects of living conditions are distinguished: a resource deficit such as unemployment, discontent with a resource deficit, and the perceived obligation of the state to provide resources. It is argued that these factors have direct effects on a set of "incentives" that, in turn, directly affect protest. Resource mobilization and opportunity structure theory suggest that resource deficits decrease protest, but after the collapse of communism it is plausible that they raise protest. These propositions are tested with 725 citizens of Leipzig in 1993. A major finding is that a resource deficit has an unexpected direct negative but a strong indirect positive effect on general discontent; discontent with a resource deficit in particular leads to a strong increase of general discontent and moral incentives; there is no effect on perceived personal influence. The article suggests a reconsideration of the role of grievances by incorporating them in a complex causal model.

AB Emergent trends in the globalization of the economy and the spatial restructuring of work portend many new challenges for workers around the world. Among the issues that have received insufficient attention is the impact of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) on labor in the U.S. Previous research has been inconclusive and plagued by a lack of empirical breadth and by insufficient theoretical explanations. In this article, we first outline a theory of spatialization as an extension of the social structures of accumulation framework to anticipate the likely consequences of FDI for workers. Second, we undertake an analysis of the forty-eight contiguous American states for the years 1978-96 of the consequences of inward FDI for labor's organizational capacity labor dissent, and the economic standing of labor. Our analysis demonstrates that inward FDI has a consistent negative effect on these labor outcomes that differs for manufacturing and nonmanufacturing FDI. We suggest that our findings are consistent with spatialization theory and inform theoretical debates oat globalization and labor in the contemporary U.S.

ID POWER; EXCHANGE; PERCEPTION; COMMITMENT; BEHAVIOR; TACTICS; NORMS
AB Based on the dependence, legitimacy, and justice literatures, lye develop predictions about how two forms of power affect subordinates' anticipated emotional reactions to an inappropriate act by a superior and the likelihood that they will express these emotions toward their superior We test the effects of dependence and legitimacy on the anticipated experience of three backward-looking emotions (satisfaction, anger, and resentment) and two forward-looking emotions (excitement and worry). Using vignettes, we asked 330 college students to take the position of a subordinate in a conflict with a manager and describe how they feel and how likely they would be to express their emotions toward their manager. The design manipulated subordinates' and superiors' alternatives as well as endorsement and authorization of the superior. Results show that subordinates report the highest levels of anger and resentment when they are in the least dependent position and the lowest levels when they are in a highly and equally dependent relationship with their superior. They also report more resentment when their superior is not endorsed. Less dependent subordinates feel more excitement and less worry than highly dependent subordinates. They also feel more excitement when their superior is not endorsed Finally, subordinates in a highly dependent position or with a highly endorsed superior are less likely to report the likelihood of expressing negative emotions toward their superior.

AB Although social isolation has been posited as a critical structural mechanism linking neighborhood disadvantage to the reduced life chances of inner-city residents, there have been few empirical tests of this proposition. We examine the relative importance of neighborhood poverty and individual and family characteristics on social-network composition and community organizational participation of inner-city Chicago African American families. The results of the multilevel analysis indicate that while most of the variation in isolation outcomes is due to individual-level respondent characteristics, social-network composition and some forms of organizational participation are affected by neighborhood poverty. Implications of the findings and directions for future research are discussed.

ID FAMILY; EMPLOYMENT; HOUSEWORK; DIVISION
AB The distribution of leisure time between the genders is contested. Becker's theory of specialization suggests that there is an underlying gender equity in leisure, while the competing view suggests that women are now bearing a "dual burden" as both family providers and family carers. Using indicators of the quantity and quality of leisure drawn from the Multinational Time Budget Data Archive and the Australian Time Use Survey, we find some support for both views Although men and women have similar quantities of free time, when the character of leisure is considered the gap between genders reemerges.

TI Is anyone doing the housework? Trends in the gender division of
   household labor

   MARITAL-STATUS; FAMILY WORK; TIME; POWER; DIFFERENCE; IDEOLOGY
AB Time-diary data from representative samples of American adults show that the number of overall hours of domestic labor (excluding child care and shopping) has continued to decline steadily and predictably since 1965. This finding is mainly due to dramatic declines among women (both in and out of the pain labor market), who have net their housework hours almost in half since the 1960s: about half of women's 12-hour-per-week decline can be accounted for by compositional shifts - such as increased labor force participation, later marriage, and fewer children. In contrast, men's housework time has almost doubled during this period (to the point where men were responsible for a third of housework in the 1990s), and only about 15% of their five-hour-per-week increase can be attributed to compositional factors. Parallel results on gender differences in housework were obtained from the National Survey of Families and Households estimate data, even though these produce figures 50% higher than diary data. Regression results examining factors related to wives' and husbands' housework hours show more support for the time-availability and relative-resource models of household production than for the gender perspective, although there is some support for the latter perspective as well.

ID LEGAL PROFESSION; LABOR-MARKETS; WOMEN; WORK; DISCRIMINATION; PROMOTION;
   ADVANCEMENT; EMPLOYMENT; PATTERNS; EARNINGS
AB Using data on lawyers in Chicago, we test competing hypotheses derived from three broad theoretical models of gender differences in professional careers: assimilation choice, and constraint. Men and women begin their careers in different practice contexts and the differences grow over time. The magnitude of these persistent differences argues against an assimilationist view Some of the divergence in career paths appears attributable to individual choices and preferences, but these do not fully account for the observed gender differences. Human-capital endowments are significant predictors of career positions but also fail to explain the observed gender differences. Women's overrepresentation in less prestigious and less remunerative settings and their underrepresentation in law-firm partnerships suggest that constraints continue to affect women's professional career opportunities.

   BEHAVIOR; RELIGION; FAIRNESS; SPANKING; SCIENCE
AB Conservative Protestant child discipline has recently become the subject of considerable social research and public controversy. However, no systematic empirical evidence has been brought to bear on conservative Protestant rates of parental yelling, which lye view as a key indicator of an authoritarian style of parenting. We review parenting advice offered by conservative Protestant elites, who articulate child-rearing schemata grounded in both religious and psychological rationales for the discipline of youngsters. Notably, conservative Protestant family specialists advocate corporal punishment while discouraging the parental use of yelling at children. Data drawn from the 1987-88 National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH) indicate that conservative Protestant parents of preschoolers and school-age children are significantly less likely to report yelling at their children. Moreover, the estimated effects of denominational affiliation on the parental use of yelling are partly mediated fly conservative theological views. We conclude by calling for research that analyzes the effects of the distinctive conservative Protestant approach to discipline on child well-being.

TI The measure of American religion: Toward improving the state of the art
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Recently, scholars have devoted renewed attention to the role of religion in American life. Thus, it is important that they use the most effective means available to categorize and study religious groups. However, the most widely used classification scheme in survey research (T.W. Smith 1990) does not capture essential differences between American religious traditions and overlooks significant new trends in religious affiliation. We critique this scheme based on its historical, terminological and taxonomical inaccuracy and offer a Mew approach that addresses its shortcomings by using denominational affiliation to place respondents into seven categories grounded in the historical development of American religious traditions. Most important, this new scheme yields more meaningful interpretations because the categories refer to concrete religious traditions. Because of increased accuracy in classification, it also improves model fit and reduces measurement error.

   ATTITUDES; FERTILITY; WOMEN; SOCIALIZATION; EXPECTATIONS
AB This article examines the extent to which childbearing behavior is determined by mothers' preferences versus individuals' own preferences. The theoretical framework is based on socialization and social control. A total of 835 mother-child pairs front the Intergenerational Panel Study of Parents and Children, a long-term longitudinal study, are analyzed using hazard models. The empirical analyses show that both soils and daughters whose mothers prefer early marriage, large families, low levels of education, and stay-at-home mothers enter parenthood earlier than their peers, and analyses show support for both socialization and social control mechanisms. The study concludes that mothers' preferences have a strong influence on when their children become parents by guiding them on different pathways toward adulthood.

ID RATES
AB The Findings of two "between-columns" tests of the theory linking status integration and the suicide rate (Stafford 8 Gibbs 1985, 1988) suggest that only occupational integration is relevant. However, in numerous "within-column" tests there is a substantial negative association between marital integration and the suicide rate among marital statuses within each age group. The present research demonstrates that the substantial negative association holds generally for six age groups of black females, black males, white females, and white males in the U.S., even when the amount of occupational integration for each marital status is taken into account. Hence, although the theory's predictive accuracy would exceed that of contenders even if limited to occupational integration, the findings caution against exclusion of marital integration.

ID STATE; PSYCHOLOGY; PUNISHMENT; DEMOCRACY; CULTURES
AB Across democratic countries, amounts of individualistic legal activity are starkly different. The current trend in explaining this variation is to break legal activity into different categories and explain why variation exists within each type. While this trend has been useful in providing detailed analyses across a narrow spectrum of activities, it moves the field away from the broader context in which all legal activity occurs. I take the opposite tack here, considering myriad types of legal activity at once. This study first finds that across nation-states, levels of many different types of legal activity are correlated with each other. Using a structural equation model and OLS regression equations, I then demonstrate that state decentralization and state/society interpenetration, i.e., the lack of a clear boundary between the state and civil society, tend to fuel individualistic legal activity. The implication is that changing individual incentives to engage in legal activity may fuel social change in some national contexts but not others, and that such contextual effects are predictable.

AB The study of inequality has been largely defined as the study of its measurable extent, degree, and consequences. It is no less important, however, to understand the interactive processes through which inequalities are created and reproduced in concrete settings. The qualitative research that bears on understanding these processes has not yet been consolidated, and thus its theoretical value remains unrealized. In this article we inductively derive from the literature a sensitizing theory of the generic processes through which inequality is reproduced. The major processes that lye identify are othering, subordinate adaptation, boundary maintenance, and emotion management. We argue that conceiving the reproduction of inequality in terms of these generic processes can resolve theoretical problems concerning the connection between local action and extralocal inequalities, and concerning the nature of inequality itself.

LA English
DT Article
ID LEGITIMATION; EXPECTATIONS; DOMINANCE; CEREMONY
AB The reproduction of social structure occurs with regularity, even when it is not in the interest of the group, the individual, or the society. This article uses the theories of structural ritualization and expectation states to examine a specific case of social reproduction: the reproduction of hierarchical group procedure and practices in small task groups. The experimental test examines forty-four task groups under three different conditions a baseline condition under which group leaders observe no task groups; a condition under which leaders observe two groups characterized by hierarchical ritual and relatively authoritarian leaders; a condition under which leaders observe two groups characterized by lesser levels of hierarchical ritual and procedure. Based upon the two theories, we predicted that leaders would transform their own groups in the image of those they observed. This would occur even though there were no incentives for particular procedures and rituals, and even though the observed groups were not involved in tasks similar to the tasks given to the leader and his group. The experimental tests generally support the theory.

AB Russians' orientations toward market reforms and toward private ownership of the means of production are modeled with January 1996 survey data using simultaneous latent class analysis (LCA) in three education groups. Roughly half of Russian adults support market institutions, and roughly one-third support state-based economic institutions. The remaining one-sixth are uncertain or hold contradictory views. As modernization theory predicts, higher levels of education increase the likelihood that Russians will adopt a proreform outlook. Economic ideology strongly affects both turnout and party choice, net of demographic variables, income, membership in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (KPSS), egocentric and sociotropic assessments, and prodemocracy views. Moreover, economic ideology decisively mediates the effects of education on party choice and on turnout. In contrast to the issue-based struggles in established capitalist democracies, political conflict in post-Soviet Russia has been ideological conflict, pitting against one another two diametrically opposed visions of what constitutes a desirable economy and society.

ID SOCIAL NETWORKS; SEX SEGREGATION; RESOURCES; WORKPLACE
AB In this article, we explore several factors that may have an effect on business start-ups, focusing on possible gender differences. We conceptualize social capital as inhering in people's relations with others and examine the association between men's and women's social capital and their likelihood of starting a business. Two aspects of respondents' social capital are highlighted: the extent to which their business discussion networks are heterogeneous and the extent to which they contain a high proportion of kin. We show that a high proportion of kin and homogeneity in the network, rather than a high proportion of females in the network or being female, are critical disadvantages facing potential small business owners.

AB The outside opportunity structure is important in predicting the likelihood and direction of job change but has received little attention. We view the ecology of organizations as a determinant of worker expectations of outside opportunity and connect characterizations of organizational size diversity and inequality with job matching and firm reputation theory on how worker expectations are affected by organizational characteristics. This leads to the predictions that greater organizational diversity and inequality within a sector of the labor market will cause more intrasector job changes and fewer intersector job changes. We test these predictions on intra- and interindustrial and regional job changes, yielding supportive results on both industrial and geographical job mobility. Comparison of the results suggests stronger evidence in favor of reputation than matching theory.

   AREAS; SUBURBANIZATION; AMERICAN; PATTERNS; REGION; WHITES
AB To understand the impacts of large-scale immigration on neighborhood contexts, we employ locational-attainment models, in which two characteristics of a neighborhood, its average household income and the majority group's percentage among its residents, are taken as the dependent variables and a number of individual and household characteristics, such as race/ethnicity and household composition, form the vector of independent variables. Models are estimated separately for major racial/ethnic populations - whites, blacks, Asians, and Latinos - in five different metropolitan regions of immigrant concentration - Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, and San Francisco. lit the moss section, the findings largely uphold the well-known model of spatial assimilation, in that socioeconomic status, assimilation level, and suburban residence are all strongly linked to residence in neighborhoods displaying greater affluence and with a greater number of non-Hispanic whites. Yet when the results are considered longitudinally, by comparing them with previously estimated models for 1980, the consistency With spatial-assimilation theory is no longer so striking. The impact of immgration is evident in the changing racial/ethnic composition of the neighborhoods of all groups, but especially for those where Asians and Latinos reside.

AB In the late 1980s and 1990s, the Aid to Families with Dependent Children fell victim to a dramatic retrenchment as states submitted waivers, or permission slips to experiment with their public assistance programs by implementing new methods of exclusion and regulation. We find that Republican states were quick to submit federal waivers to the the AFDC program,as were states with high AFDC payments. As Soule and Zylan (1997) found in their study of an earlier wave of welfare retrenchment in the U.S., states with higher minority group populations and heavier AFDC caseloads were quick to pass waivers. Following Pierson (1994, 1996), we find that states with an increasing tax revenue base and with a high proportion of Social Security recipients were quick to submit waivers, while states with a high proportion of Unemployment Insurance recipients were slow to do so. We also find evidence for the geographic diffusion of waiver submission and that states experiencing fiscal crisis were more susceptible to the diffusing of waivers. Finally, we find that states which are traditionally innovative with regard to policy decisions served as referents to other states puzzling over whether or not to submit waivers.

AB This article focuses on employers' responses to AFL organizing efforts in the meatpacking industry in Chicago and the steel industry in Gary, Indiana, between 1917 and 1919. First, I develop a typology of split labor markets that incorporates the insights of the neo-Marxist divide-and-rule perspective. Second, I use event-structure analysis (ESA) to systematically examine causal sequences in the Chicago and Gary union campaigns. The analyses suggest that (I) both capitalist and state actors meditate conflicts between racial groups in the labor market and that (2) employers actively contribute to racial antagonism when emergent interracial coalitions threaten to increase labor costs and polarize class struggle. The revised split labor market theory explains how the features of industrial labor markets affect the strategies of employers as well as majority and minority workers.

SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID CRIMINAL VICTIMIZATION; ROUTINE ACTIVITIES; PROPERTY CRIME;
   SOCIAL-CHANGE; RATES
AB This study extends the research on the opportunity theory of criminal victimization. Specifically, it is proposed that living in a cohesive community directly reduces the likelihood of experiencing violent predatory criminal victimization. Tightly knit communities have higher levels of informal guardianship, and members of such communities are more active in intervening in public deviant or criminal activities, thus limiting opportunities for the commission of violent crimes. This theoretical model is tested with a sample of more than 19,000 respondents to national-level victimization surveys from 15 countries. A replication is also performed with data from over 10,000 respondents to city level surveys in another 12 countries. The results provide strong support for the hypothesis that people who live in communities which they perceive to be cohesive have a lower likelihood of violent victimization. The data indicate that net of relevant socioeconomic, demographic, lifestyle, and neighborhood status characteristics, community cohesion consistently reduces the likelihood of robbery and assault near the home, and robbery and assault near the home by strangers. The consistency of the results suggests that community cohesion may be a major determinant of victimization risk.

AB This article tests a conditional effect hypothesis which predicts that the strength and magnitude of the association between racial composition and mime rates will dissipate with increasing distance of neighborhoods from public housing projects. We examine this hypothesis with 1990-92 gee-coded mime incident data matched with 1990 block-group-level census data for Atlanta. The hypothesis is supported in models predicting murder, rape, assault, and public order crime, but not robbery and property crime. Confirmation of our conditional effect hypothesis for several major types of crime suggests the potential for bias in interpretations of estimated race effects in multivariate neighborhood-level models that do not control for public housing.

AB We used national data from two samples reflecting different marriage cohorts to examine long-term changes in gender relations within marriage, long-term changes in marital quality, and the association between the two. The first marriage cohort consisted of individuals married between 1964 and 1980 (N = 1,119) and interviewed in 1980, whereas the second marriage cohort consisted of individuals married between 1981 and 1997 (N = 312) and interviewed in 1997. Compared with the earlier cohort, the more recent cohort reported larger contributions to household income among wives, more employment of wives with preschool-age children, less traditional gender-role attitudes, a greater share of housework on the part of husbands, less husband influence in marriage, and greater wife influence in marriage. Members of the more recent marriage cohort also reported significantly more marital discord. This difference in discord was explained partly by greater work-family conflict in the more recent cohort. Other changes in gender relations, however were not related to increases in marital discord.

   SOCIAL SUPPORT; FAMILY; PARTICIPATION; CHOICE; COMMITMENT; COMMUNITY
AB I draw from existing literature on migration decision-making theory and research on the importance and meaning of religion in individual lives to examine how religious involvement and membership affect the odds of migrating. lit addition, I develop a concept called location-specific religious capital. Frequent church attendance and involvement in the social aspects of one's religious organization are proposed as forms of location-specijfic religious capital. Membership in strict and conservative religious organizations is viewed similarly for their requirement of large investments. As individuals invest more time and energy in the development and maintenance of location-specific religious capital, they will be increasingly hesitant to migrate out of their community and, thus, out of their church. The specific hypotheses are tested with data collected between 1980 and 1997 from a U.S. national sample of adults. The results are complex and provide some support for the migration-discouraging influence of location-specific religious capital. Differences correlate with age and presence of children in the household.

AB This article uses event history analyses to examine how the criteria of political screening and educational credentials evolve in the attainment of Chinese Communist Party membership during the period between 1949 and 1993 and how party membership, in turn, influences individual mobility into elite political and managerial positions. We argue that political screening is a persistent feature and a survival strategy of all Communist parties and that the mechanisms of ensuring political screening are affected by the regime's agendas in different historical periods. Using data from surveys conducted in Shanghai and Tianjin in 1993, we found that measures of political screening were persistently significant predictors of party membership attainment in all post-1949 periods and that party membership is positively associated with mobility into positions of political and managerial authority during the post-1978 reform era. Education emerged to be a significant predictor of Communist party membership in the post-1978 period. These findings indicate that China has made historical shifts to recruit among the educated to create a technocratic elite that is both occupationally competent and politically screened.

AB White-on-black violence was a fact of life in the Deep South during the decades straddling the turn of the century. Yet though the lynching of blacks is historically significant, it was, statistically speaking, a relatively rare event. While each lynching is associated with a complex and often gruesome narrative, particularities often overwhelm efforts to reveal anything other than broad structural determinants or proximate causes. Efforts to apply narrative methods have been limited to the analysis of a single lynching incident, and yield more insight into patterns of interaction than into the phenomena of lynching as a whole. This article offers a new analytic description of the temporal structure of local lynching histories in the Deep South between 1882 and 1930. Sequential analysis reveals robust variation in the temporal pattern of local lynching; interpretation of the finite set of patterns of lynching histories focuses on the sequential consequences of various microlevel mechanisms, and demonstrates the advantages of moving beyond the analysis of discrete incidents.

AB We investigate the effects of both family and school capital on student math and reading achievement. We use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) merged Child-Mother Data for 1992 and 1994, to which indicators of capital in the children's schools for 1993-94 and 1994-95 have recently been added. We study children who attended first through eighth grades in both 1992 and 1994, with samples of 2034 for math achievement and 2203 for reading recognition. Findings suggest that school capital effects are modest in size while family capital effects are stronger; combinations of school and family capital boost or modify additive findings. We sketch directions for future research and discuss the usefulness of analyzing school and family capital as parallel concepts.

AB Gender bias in family formation in China is well documented. Much less is known about how children fare once they become part of a family. Drawing on field work and survey data, we describe the care of young children, and investigate the relationship between the one-child policy and parental involvement in care. Results indicate that the one-child policy, insofar as it limits couples to one or two children, leads to greater involvement by parents in child care. Additional effects of policy vary by children's gender. Boys receive similar care regardless of the one-child policy in their communities. Girls, living in communities where couples are permitted another child if their first is a girl, are more likely to receive parental care than girls in other communities. These results suggest that gender bias in China is not solely due to outdated "feudal" ideas resulting in son preference.

ID AFRICAN-AMERICAN; FAMILY; CONTACT; ABSENT
AB This study examines the nature and determinants of father involvement among mainland Puerto Ricans using interview data collected from mothers of a representative sample of Puerto Rican infants. Focusing on both financial contributions and participation in child care (e.g., diapering, feeding and bathing the child), the behavior of nonresident fathers is compared to that of cohabiting fathers and married fathers. A key question addressed in the analysis is whether father involvement is influenced primarily by the father's economic status or whether other factors identified in the literature are also important for Puerto Ricans. Overall, our results underscore the critical role of employment in fathers' contributions to Puerto Rican children.

AB Utilizing data on adolescents in secondary school from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), this article examines the link between immigrant generation and adolescent psychological well-being. I find that first-generation immigrants experience less depression and greater positive well-being than their native born agemates of similar demographic and family backgrounds. Second-generation immigrants, however, do not differ significantly from native-born youth in terms of psychological well-being. A number of family influences serve as "protective" factors that enable first-generation immigrants to maintain their higher levels of well-being. These factors include parental supervision, lack of parent-child conflict, religious practices, and social support. Assimilation among first-generation immigrants, as measured by age at arrival in the U.S., does not significantly affect their positive well-being.

AB In this article we examine women's labor force experience during the early life course in order to assess the conditions conductive to the establishment of stable labor force careers. To represent the complexity of women's work trajectories during young adulthood we develop a conceptual Framework that depicts a broad range of work activity profiles. Empirical results obtained using the NLSY show that three aspects of early experience influence mature women's labor force attachment, namely the amount of experience accumulated the timing of work experience and the volatility of that experience. Above and beyond these experience measures, we also find that background factors influence adult women's attachment to the market. The conclusion discusses the policy implications of these results.

AB Several theoretical traditions offer insights into individual success in conventional activities. We extend this work suggesting that explanations of success also apply to crime: although prosperity in licit or illicit activities has several unique antecedents, success in either endeavor is influenced by common factors. Most research on conventional success focuses on the effects of human and social capital, and criminal forms of these are important for illegal success. We argue that various aspects of conventional personal capital - a heightened desire for wealth, a propensity for risk-taking, a willingness to cooperate and competence - also play important roles in both legal and illegal prosperity. We demonstrate the importance of various types of capital, particularly the salience of personal capital, with data on drug-selling income.

AB This article explores how national identities are constructed through language by examining the accent negotiations of a group of white English immigrants to the U.S. Pointing to the anxiety that any Americanization of their accents engendered, I show how individuals cope with claiming an identity that seems to be undermined by their speech style. They negotiated this contradiction in two ways: first, they feared that an invisible audience of English people would unmask them as not properly English; and second, they used distancing mechanisms - namely, sarcasm, disgust, anxiety about disloyalty, and a recourse to physicality - to distance themselves from the Americanisms that crept into their linguistic habitus. These mechanisms allowed the immigrants to maintain their sense of Englishness even when they did not sound English.

AB What accounts for changes in the social composition of occupations over time? We address this question by adapting an ecological theory of competition from McPherson (1983). This theory suggests that occupations compete for members in a niche space defined by the social composition of an occupation's members. As one occupation successfully acquires and retains new people with different sociodemographic characteristics, other occupations experience shifts in their sociodemographic composition. Using the Current Population Survey Annual Demographic Files (1972-82), we test dynamic hypotheses about changes in the age and education composition of occupations. The data strongly support the theory. We then ask whether the same dynamics apply to the professions and occupations. The data suggest that professional closure limits the movement of professions in the education dimension.

AB While rational choice theorists have made great advances in their study of institutions and structures (and how they affect behavior), they have made less progress toward understanding the origins of values. I propose that the emerging field of evolutionary psychology complements rational choice theory by providing a theory of values, and that current explanations of values and preferences, such as learning, norms, and identities, are all compatible with evolutionary psychology, which provides more ultimate explanations for these proximate causes of behavior. The incorporation of evolutionary psychology into rational choice theory can also solve some of the persistent puzzles of rational choice theory: Why do so many players in Prisoner's Dilemma games make the irrational choice to cooperate? Why do people participate in collective action! Why do people sometimes behave "irrationally" by acting on their emotions? Why does rational choice theory appear to be more applicable to men than to women?.

ID EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT; CONSUMPTION; OMNIVORE; CULTURE
AB In this article, we investigate patterns of musical taste using a large sample from the Dutch population. It is found that members from higher-status groups tend to be more omnivorous (that is, they like more different musical genres) than those from lower status groups, which is in line with Peterson's (1992; Peterson & Sinkus 1992) hypothesis. The actual difference is, however, rather small and occurs only with regard to the number of genres that respondents like at least "more or less," not with regard to their favorite genres. In order to discover the combinatorial logic by which musical genres are clustered into specific taste patterns a factor model is estimated The results indicate that musical genres can be structured on the basis of three basic "discourses" (highbrow, POP, folk). The so-called omnivores comprise a specific faction of the higher-status groups known as the new middle class, whose tastes combine a set of genres related to all these discourses.

DT Article
AB This article makes contributions toward the conceptualization of the scholarship of teaching and learning (Scholarship of Teaching and Learning). The scholarship of teaching is a concept with multiple ramifications. It is at the core of the current transformation of higher education. The scholarship of teaching challenges the existing stratification system within the academy. The scholarship of teaching and learning is a much larger enterprise, a movement, that can transform the nature of American society toward our ideals of equality and justice. Sociologists have a vital role to play within the academy and society. If we take advantage of the opportunity that the scholarship of teaching and learning offers, we can reach our potential as an intellectually liberating force in society.

TI Families and self-sacrifice: Alternative models and meanings for family
   theory
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
AB The concept of sacrifice used to be a dominant theme in social scientific theorizing, but it is now so neglected that recent work speaks of the need for a "recovery" of sacrifice. Similarly, self-sacrifice in the service of family members, formerly seen as high virtue, is now often characterized as personality defect or self-defeating behavior. Neither self-sacrifice nor family love play a significant part in the prevailing family theories, grounded as they are in the assumption of self-interest and framed in the logic of utilitarian individualism and the rationalized marketplace. This "silence" is more ideologically based than reflective of family process. The absence of a language of sacrifice and love limits our ability to give voice to our experience, and the professional neglect of these concepts diminishes our understanding of the processes they name. Some recent work on sacrifice by scholars in other disciplines has implications for family theory. We draw from the disciplines of economics, history, philosophy, literature, sociology, and from life as lived by everyday people ill making the case that self-sacrifice is a powerful and essential part of social lift, generally, and family life in particular. It merits a more substantial place in contemporary theory. Some theoretical approaches compatible with self-sacrifice as principle and practice are offered..

AB Social networks have a relatively large and multifaceted effect on the stability of intimate relationships, based on proportional hazard analysis involving 290 individuals. Perceptions of approval from a respondents friends and approval from a partner's family increase relationship stability. On the other hand, perceived approval from a respondents family, overall encouragement to date and closeness to a best friend decrease stability in the multivariate model. Perceptions of social approval are beater at predicting stability than actual approval. The effects of social networks occur even after controlling for the significant effects of dyadic variables such as the perceived existence of alternatives, closeness to the partner, and arguing. Findings confirm the positive and negative roles of social ties and support the argument that friendships can compete with romantic relationships for companionship.

   DETERMINANTS; PREFERENCES; DISTANCE; HOMOGAMY; CHINESE; TRENDS
AB An important hypothesis about why people generally interact with people who are socially or culturally similar to themselves is that the opportunities they have to meet similar others are greater than the opportunities they have to meet dissimilar others. We examine this supply-side perspective on social relationships by empirically linking marriage choices to the type of setting couples had in common before they married. We focus on five meeting settings (work, school, the neighbourhood common family networks, and voluntary associations) and five types of homogamy (with respect to age, education, class destination, class origin, and religious background). Using data from face-to-face interviews among married and cohabiting couples in the Netherlands, we show that these five contexts account for a sizable portion of the places where partners have met. Using loglinear analyses, we subsequently examine whether couples who shared settings are more homogamous than couples who did not share a setting. Our results indicate that schools promote most forms of homogamy, while work places only promote homogamy with respect to class destinations Neighbourhoods and common family networks promote religious homogamy, but they are not related to homogamy with respect to class origins. While in some cases, settings have unexpected effects of marriage choice, our findings generally confirm the notion that mating requires meeting: the pool of available interaction partners is shaped by various institutionally organized arrangements and these constrain the type of people with whom we form personal relationships.

DT Article
ID FAMILY-LIFE-CYCLE; MARRIAGE COHORTS; 3 GENERATIONS; UNITED-STATES;
   QUALITY; SATISFACTION; TRANSITION; PARENTHOOD; ATTITUDES; STABILITY
AB Previous research suggests a U-shaped pattern of marital happiness over the life course, with happiness declining in the early years of marriage and rising in the later years. Most prior studies have been limited by the use of cross-sectional data or nonprobability samples. In contrast, the present study is based on data from a national, 17-year, 5-wave panel sample. Using cross-sectional data from the first wave, we replicate the U-shaped relationship between marial happiness and marital duration. In an analysis based on a fixed-effects pooled time-series model with multiple-wave panel data, we find declines in marital happiness at all marital durations and no support for an upturn in marital happiness in the later years. The relationship between marital happiness and marital duration is slightly curvilinear, with the steepest declines in martial happiness occurring during the earliest and latest years of marriage. When other life-course are controlled, a significant negative effect of marital duration on marital happiness remains. For most marriage cohorts, marital happiness declined more in the 1980s than in the 1990s, suggesting a period effect. This study provides evidence that the U-shaped pattern of marital happiness over the life course is an artifact of cross-sectional research and is not typical of U.S. marriages.

ID PUBLIC-OPINION; UNITED-STATES; WELFARE-STATE; POLITICAL ISSUES; TRUST;
   REPRESENTATION; IMPACT
AB No trend in U.S, public opinion has elicited more enduring concern among scholars, political commentators, ann politicians than declining levels of public confidence in the federal government. Motivated by the possibility that this decline signals a crisis of legitimacy or growing dissatisfaction with the overall direction of public policy: two generations of scholarly debates have yielded three competing theoretical interpretations of this phenomenon. While they provide divergent answers to important questions about the devolution of policy-making from the federal government to subnational level of government, competing hypotheses implied by these interpretations have not been successfully evaluated. We seek to advance theory and research by investigating whether governmental confidence affects the public's willingness to support federal involvement within specific policy domains such as health care and education. Evaluating hypotheses implied by competing interpretations of declining government confidence, we find that the relationship between government confidence and policy preferences is small and shows no evidence of trends. We discuss implications for competing and interpretations of government confidence and the possible role of declining confidence in explaining contemporary patterns of welfare state retrenchment.

AB This research uses data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to examine racial differences in the ability to translate mobility expectations into a residential move. The results indicate that, despite similar mobility expectations, black householders are significantly less likely than white householders to translate their expectations into a residential move. Supportind the stratification perspective, this racial difference persists when a variety of individual and contextual characteristics are controlled. Furthermore, higher income appears to enhance the ability of white but not black householders to convert their mobility expectations into a move. Supplemental analyses suggest that this racial stratification does not reflect poorer planning on the part of blacks and that thia racial disparity helps to explain existind racial differences in the ability to escape poor neighborhoods.

TI From protest to agenda building: Description bias in media coverage of
   protest events in Washington, DC
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID NEWSPAPER
AB Social movements often seek to draw attention to issues they deem important by organizing public demonstrations with the aim of attracting mass media coverage. But only a small proportion of all public demonstrations receives any media attention. This article asks whether even the minimal coverage that demonstrations receive reveal any influence of social movements in shaping how issues are framed by the mass media. Analyzing newspaper and television news stories on Washington, D.C. protests held during 1982 and 1991, we ask whether news reports on protests are framed in ways consistent with the aims of protesters. Do demonstrators receive media coverage that highlights the issues about which they are concerned, or does coverage focus on the protest event itself, to the exclusion of the social issues that movements target? Our results support much of the surmising among media scholars, that even when movements succeed at obtaining the attention of mass media outlets, media reports portray protests in ways that may undermine social movement agendas. Despite this obstacle to communicating protest messages through demonstrations, movements engage in other forms of communication that can affect public interpretations of mass media frames.

   APOSTASY; CULTURE; FAMILY; MOBILIZATION; PERSPECTIVE; CONSTRAINTS
AB Most students of social protest now agree that protest participation and participation in institutionalized politics are both potentially effective means of addressing individual and collective grievances. A primary conceptual distinction between the two forms of political participation centers on the contentious nature of protest. We focus attention on the disruptive potential of religious beliefs and values and argue that approval of contentious tactics is a critical link between religious beliefs and protest participation. We analyze data from a representative sample of churchgoing Protestants in the United States. Results show that four factors increase the likelihood that Protestants approve of contentious tactics: volunteering for church organizations, a perception that religious values are being threatened, a belief that individuals should not have a right to deviate front Christian moral standards, and a belief that humans are inherently sinful. Approval of contentious tactics and frequent volunteering for church organizations are the only variables in our analysis that differentiate conservative Christian voters from those who combine conservative Christian voting with protest participation.

AB Trends and patterns of religious mobility have played a central role in theoretical controversies in the sociology of religion. Early examinations focused on how social status might motivate religious switching, and recently scholars have claimed that diminishing status differences between denominations have opened denominational boundaries and led to higher rates of religious mobility. Scholars working from rational actor perspectives have generated several hypotheses. First, human capital and adaptive preference theories suggest that switching will remain infrequent, and will tend to occur between similar denominations. Second, "strict church" perspectives argue that demanding sectarian denominations will have higher retention, and be more attractive destinations. Third, market niche perspectives argue that niche overlap will foster high rates of religious mobility. Finally, theories emphasizing normative constraints on religious choices suggest that quasi-ethnic religious groups will have a greater hold on members. This article examines trends and patterns of religious mobility in the U.S. between 1973 and 1998 using data from the General Social Surveys. Retention rates, distributions of original and destination affiliations, and mobility tables are compared across three periods, and four broad cohorts using log-multiplicative association models. I find some support for hypotheses generated by status theories, and for several propositions from rational actor theories, however the decline of denominationalism perspective is unsupported.

AB Through a case analysis of how medicine's intra-occupational division of labor responded to the development of gastrointestinal endoscopy, this article sheds light on how occupational divisions of labor respond to technological innovation. The article proposes that innovations are introduced into such structures in ways consistent with the cultural scripts that regulate relations and workflows between occupations' functional segments. However, these scripts may not be able to regulate effectively subsequent developments, and structural divisions may produced intra-occupational conflict and struggle over market turf. A "Trojan horse" metaphor is used to illustrate this process. The analysis developed here poses questions about the current tendency to extol the virtues of occupational divisions of labor, for such structures may lack effective mechanisms, for regulating the unintended outcomes of technological change.

AB The most accepted explanation for gender differences is the sociocultural model that holds them to be results of socialization and/or occupancy of sex differentiated roles. There has been extensive social change in the past three decades, reducing sex typed role assignments and attitudes. However, examination of some 30 researches shows that the social change has not been followed by change in sex typing. This present study of trends in stereotypic and self responses between 1974 and 1997 confirms the stability in sex typing, over seven surveys and 4,000 respondents. In addition, there is evidence of increase in the perceived femininity of females. These results are contrary to the predictions from the sociocultural model. They are, however, consistent with the alternate evolutionary model postulating constant gendered differences based on genetic patterns evolved from adaptations to differing reproductive challenges of early males and females.

SO SOCIAL FORCES

ID STATE
AB This article discusses the concept of "party formation," that is, the historically evolved links between a party and the civil society from which its political power is derived. This concept is developed through an empirical analysis of differences in poverty eradication by leftist parties in the states of Kerala and West Bengal, India. The argument is made that the ostensibly common identity of a Communist party in the two cases conceals different "party formations." In Kerala, it evolved as a more popular party, with deeper roots in civil society, while in West Bengal it was much weaker. These differences are attributed to the political practices of each party during the anticolonial movement, the structural conditions within which each had to function, and the consequent variations in political power.

   EXPLANATIONS; FEAR
AB Despite considerable theoretical interest, little is known about the political determinants of punishment. This study uses a pooled time-series design to fill this gap by examining political and other determinants of state imprisonment rates. The presence of Republican elected officials is used to assess the strength of the law-and-order political party. Ethnic threat theories suggest that imprisonments will be more likely in jurisdictions with the most blacks or Hispanics, while economic threat theories suggest that the imprisoned population will be greater where economic stratification is most pronounced. After controlling for social disorganization, religious fundamentalism, political conservatism, and violent crimes, the results show that Republican strength and minority threat lead to higher imprisonment rates. Statistical interactions support predictions that these relationships became stronger after greater Republican stress on law and order. The latter findings confirm theoretical expectations that these relationships are historically contingent.

AB To assess the determinants of political support for redistribution, this time-series study analyzes historically contingent changes in the progressivity of the income tax. Nonviolent civil rights protest should increase sympathy for the least affluent and enhance support for redistributive policies, but social problems blamed on the underclass may have the opposite effect. After controlling for shifts in partisan control of the presidency, nonwhite presence, family incomes, and union strength, the results suggest that civil rights activity leads to redistributive tax codes, but social problems blamed on the underclass such as riots or crime reduce tax progressivity. Additional findings suggest that these relationships are contingent. The positive relationship between civil rights actions and redistributive tax policies is significantly stronger when Democrats control the presidency, but the negative relationship between riots and egalitarian taxation is enhanced during Republican administrations.

ID BEHAVIOR; POWER; APPRECIATION; EXCHANGE; EMOTION; FUNNY; WOMEN; JOKES;
   MEN
AB Humor is a quintessentially social phenomenon, since every joke requires both a teller and an audience. Here we ask how humor operates in task-oriented group discussions. We use theories about the functions of humor to generate hypotheses about who jokes, when and in what situations. Then we use event history techniques to analyze humor attempts and successes in six-person groups. Our results combine to suggest an image of joking as a status-related activity, with men, high participators, frequent interrupters, and those who are frequently interrupted all showing status-related patterns of humor use. We find substantial time dependence in humor use, in which humor may serve to form a status hierarchy earl), in a group's development and to dissipate task-related tension later in the discussion. We use these results, in conjunction with core insights on status and emotion from the group processes literature, to develop a new theory of humor usc in task-oriented groups. The new theory generates predictions about the content of humor episodes, which we examine with additional data from our group discussions. Consistent with the theory, wc find that a higher proportion of men's humor is differentiating, while a higher proportion of womens humor is cohesion-building. We find the same general pattern with our other status variable, participation.

ID SOCIAL-EXCHANGE; POWER; NETWORKS; COMMITMENT
AB Contemporary social exchange researchers have largely ignored how variations in the value of exchange affect power relations, concentrating instead on effects of the structure of exchange, particularly the size and shape of exchange networks. In this article, we show that value, when conceptualized and studied as a dimension of actors' alternative exchange relations, has strong and systematic effects on actors' use of power. Results of a laboratory experiment support our hypotheses, showing that an actor's power over another increases with the value of that actor's exchange with alternative partners. The effects of value on power use are comparable in strength to the effects of the availability of alternatives, and they are remarkably robust, holding for both negotiated and reciprocal forms of exchange and for networks in which the availability of alternative partners is both high and low.

TI Lines of power in exchange networks
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL
AB Network exchange theory (NET) predicts differences in the resource accumulations of positions in interconnected groups of actors. The theory distinguishes between two types of networks-strong and weak power. To date only a few studies have tested the theory under weak power conditions. In the present research we investigate six line networks that contain elements of both strong and weak power. Line networks have been particularly, important in theories of social exchange and the importance of linear exchange is frequently reflected in natural settings. Four of the investigated lines are longer than any previously studied. We introduce new experimental features designed to minimize extraneous factors, thereby optimizing the translation of structural power differences into observable profit differentials. Results generally support the idea that longer lines may contain elements of both strong and weak power. Most notably, while positions identified as high strong power do obtain approximately 70% or more of resources, there is evidence that a nonzero likelihood of exclusion in the central position of the 7-line may decrease its power.

AB Although interest in the links between religion and mental health has increased sharply in recent years, researchers remain far from a consensus regarding which aspects of religious involvement are germane to mental health, which mental health outcomes may be influenced by religious factors, and which mechanisms and/or models may account for these observed relationships. This article extends the literature in this area by elaborating a set of direct, mediating, and moderating links between multiple dimensions Of religious involvement and psychological distress and well-being. Relevant hypotheses are then tested using data from the 1995 Detroit Area Study. Among our key findings: the frequency of church attendance bears a positive association with well-being and an inverse association with distress; the frequency of prayer has a slight inverse link with well-being and a weak positive association with distress; belief in eternal life is positively associated with well-being but unrelated to distress, in general, the net effects of these religious variables are not mediated by the risk of social stressors or by access to social or psychological resources, other religious variables, including measures of church-based social support, are unrelated to distress or well-being; and there is limited evidence of stress-buffering effects, but not stress-exacerbating effects, of religious involvement. The limitations of the study are discussed, and several implications and promising directions for further research oil religion and health/well-being are identified.

AB In most nations, suicide rates tend to increase and homicide victimization rates tend to decrease with age, but the degree of increase and decrease varies over time and across nations. In particular, some nations more than others show a worsening of youth lethal violence relative to older age groups. This age variation across nations and time in both forms of lethal violence may result from (1) the sizes of youth and elderly age groups, and the disadvantages and advantages, respectively, that size brings; (2) family changes that most harm younger, more recent cohorts; and (3) sociopolitical dimensions of equality that smooth the transition to adulthood. Using aggregate data on 18 nations over the period from 1955 to 1994, the analysis examines how these determinants affect measures of suicide and homicide rates among the young relative to older ages. In support of the theoretical arguments, the results show that deviations from the general increase in suicide with age and decrease in homicide with age relate as predicted to measures of demographic, family and sociopolitical institutions.

   SPACE; TIME; TIES; FEAR
AB Despite recent theoretical attention to "social capital" and its impact on a range of public problems, including crime, few studies have evaluated the relationship between crime rates and levels of social capital across populations. That research gap is due, in part, to the absence of macro-level empirical indicators of social capital. In this article, we measure social capital as a latent construct with aggregated voting and organizational membership data, and survey data on social trust, and examine its relationship with homicide rates for a nationally representative sample of geographic areas. Structural equation models show that the construct of social capital has a significant direct effect on homicide rates, net of other structural covariates, and controlling for the reciprocal influence of homicide on social capital. Although social capital mediates little of the effect on homicide of levels of economic deprivation, it explains more than two-thirds of the effect of Southern regional location. The results indicate that depleted social capital contributes to high levels of homicide, and provide a promising basis for future research on the mechanisms linking social capital to crime at the macro level.

AB Using data from the Census of Agriculture and other secondary sources, we examine the relationship between scale of farm operations in a comity and the well-being of local residents. Following earlier work by C. Wright Mills and Walter Goldschmidt, we hypothesize that in agriculture dependent counties that are dominated by a small handful of very large farms, the level of community tw fare will be significantly lower than in counties in which agriculture is organized around smaller-scale farm operations. Findings show that scale of farm operations is related to well-being. However, this relationship is mediated by the level of civic engagement and the strength of the economically independent middle class. A theory of civic community is proposed to account for these findings.

AB Kanazawa and Still (1999) argue for a female choice theory of marriage practices. This theory assumes that women determine the marriage form and that the will choose polygyny when the resource inequalities among men are great and monogamy when these inequalities are relatively low. I argue that the theory is problematic for a number of reasons, most importantly because it ignores male choice. Polygyny results primarily from male rather than female choice because it flows from the male desire for sexual variety, a desire that has evolved to promote male reproductive success. As for monogamy, Richard Alexanders theory, which argues that nation-states impose monogamy on their male citizens in order to equalize their reproductive opportunities, is suggested as the best theory currently available, and empirical data are presented to support this claim.

AB Sanderson's comment (Social Forces 80.1) is marred by logical and factual errors. Most of them stein from its confusion of a polygynous marriage with a polygynous society, misinterpretation of basic principles of evolutionary biology and psychology, and errors in Statistical argument.

SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB In their article "Why monogamy?" Kanazawa and Still (1999) misrepresent my theory of monogamy as based on egalitarianism among males. I find that a variety of different interests at play in the development of mating systems and that monogamy is a complex, historically conditioned outcome of these differing interests. Because there are no powerful, theoretically-based reasons that specify the conditions under which monogamy is expected to occur, we must examine the detailed historical record for each documented case. I have found that egalitarian striving among males is only one mechanism in the development of monogamy in Western Europe. Other mechanisms include the efforts of some classes of women and a top-down mechanism in which the Catholic Church played a central role in the development of monogamy in the late Middle Ages.

AB Returning to themes of Land (1971a) and Land (1971b), this article addresses topics informal sociological models and the definition, construction, and interpretation of social indicators. I show how standard classes of formalisms used to construct models in contemporary sociology can be derived from the general theory of models. This demonstrates, at a high level of abstraction, the isomorphism of many formal sociological models to the formal models used in virtually every scientific discipline today. I also review recent model-building and model-evaluation efforts in which I have participated on the estimation of active life expectancy of the U.S. elderly population, an assessment of the robustness of a recently proposed adjusted total fertility rate, and the construction of a new index of child and youth well-being. These studies show how formal models help us to see patterns in data that otherwise are not detectable, improve social measurement, and, in particular, define and interpret social indicators.

SO SOCIAL FORCES

DT Review
ID HISTORICAL SOCIOLOGY; INSTITUTIONS; REVOLUTION; PRUSSIA; TAXES; BIRTH
AB Although the causal impact of war on state-making in the early modern era is now widely accepted, there is less consensus about the way in which war affects levels of taxation, and the factors that might strengthen or weaken the relationship. Two questions can be posed: Do individual wars produce immediate effects on taxes, or is the cumulative effect of long periods of warfare more important? How do variations in administrative capacity and the strength of representative institutions affect the extent to which war pushes the growth of the state? This article attempts to answer these questions with a quantitative analysis of the effects of war on taxation in early modern England and France. We find that the cumulative effect of war is strong in both cases, suggesting that war made states via a "ratchet effect," and that this effect is much stronger sua when the administrative capacity of states is improved by centralization and bureaucratization. Strong representative assemblies decrease the effect of war on state growth in France but increase it in England, due to the very different characteristics of these institutions in the two countries.

ID SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; RESOURCE MOBILIZATION; WESTERN-EUROPE; POLITICAL
   OPPORTUNITIES; AMERICA; POWER
AB In nearly every state around the turn of the twentieth century, suffragists mobilized in grassroots suffrage organizations to secure the vote for women. Mile movement researchers have theorized that political opportunities are important in explaining why movements emerge, the results from an examination of the emergence of the state suffrage movements show that the mobilization of various resources along with the way in which pro-suffrage arguments were framed were instrumental in stirring up suffrage sentiment. Political opportunities did little to explain the emergence of the suffrage movements. The article concludes that movement researchers need to consider that historically contingent circumstances may determine which factors bring about movement mobilization.

SO SOCIAL FORCES

DT Article
ID SECULARIZATION; DEBATE; CHURCH
AB Is the new paradigin in the sociology of religion, known commonly as the "supply-side" or "rational choice" perspective, leading towards a plausible general theory? At this point, the answer remains dependent upon how one interprets current deviations from the paradigin's predictions. This article investigates two cases in postcommunist Europe, Poland and East Germany, which appear to contradict a simple core hypothesis of the new paradigin. We argue that these anomalous cases are opportunities to examine and potentially extend the explanatory range of the new paradigin. Ultimately, we conclude that these cases can be shown through closer analysis to fit with the underlying logic of the new paradigin and thereby argue for the theory's continued evaluation and augmentation.

TI The beloved myth: Protestantism and the rise of industrial capitalism in
   nineteenth-century Europe
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID RATIONAL CAPITALISM; WEBER
AB Me investigate the thesis widely credited to Max Weber that Protestantism contributed to the rise of industrial capitalism by estimating the associations between thepercentage of Protestants and the development of industrial capitalism in European countries in the mid- to late nineteenth century. Development is measured using five sets of variables, including measures of wealth and savings, the founding date of the principal stock exchange, extension of the railroads network, distribution of the male labor force in agriculture and in industry, and infant mortality. On the basis of this evidence, there is little empirical support for what we call the "Common Interpretation" of Weber's The Protestant Ethic, namely the idea that the strength of Protestantism in a country was associated with the early development of industrial capitalism. The origin of the Common Interpretation and its popular success are probably derived largely from selected anecdotal evidence fortified, through retrospective imputation, by the perceived well-being of contemporary Protestant countries.

SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; MARRIAGE; RETREAT; TRENDS; LIFE
AB Recent findings show that black southern-born migrants to the north exhibit greater family stability than northern natives do. However, this "migrant advantage" remains to be explained. Using data from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series, this Study,gates the extent to which it can be explained by selective migration. Findings investigates reveal that migrants of all kinds, regardless of their origins or destinations, are more family-stable than are nonmigrants. Furthermore, selective migration of this sort explains much of the southern migrants' advantage with respect to family stability. Findings also suggest that the residual southern migrant advantage left unexplained by selective migration is unlikely to have resulted from any cultural differences between the north and the south.

TI African Americans and immigrants in northern cities: The effects of
   relative group size on occupational standing in 1920
SO SOCIAL FORCES

ID MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; GENDER INEQUALITY; BLACK-WHITE
AB Prior to World War I millions of immigrants arrived from Europe to work in northern plants and factories. During and after the war the African American populations of northern cities grew rapidly as southern migrants moved north. This article examines the effects of the relative sizes of these two population groups on the occupational standing of African Americans and immigrants in 1920. The results show that the occupational standing of African Americans was unaffected by the relative sizes of the black and immigrant populations in their labor markets. In contrast, the occupational fortunes of all immigrants were more favorable in labor markets with proportionately larger black populations. For new immigrants a curvilinear relationship also existed between individual occupational standing and the relative size of their population in the labor market, with the negative relationship observed at lower levels of immigrant concentration turning positive in areas with proportionately more immigrants.

TI Race, region, and religious involvement: A comparative study of whites

SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID SEMI-INVOLUNTARY INSTITUTION; CHURCH ATTENDANCE; BLACK-AMERICANS;
   PARTICIPATION; THESIS
AB This research examines (1) whether a comparative study of African Americans and whites in a nationwide sample bears ow the widespread assumption of a distinctive African American religiosity (when region and other factors are controlled), and (2) whether any race differences provide support for the "semi-involuntary" interpretation of African American religious involvements. Using data from the 1974-94 General Social Surveys, we examine how a variety of indicators of religious involvement vary by race and region. We find two basic types of evidence qualifying the assertion of a generalized heightened religiosity among African Americans. First, in analyzing three major subregions of the U.S., we find that African Americans, compared with whites, are no more religiously involved in the rural South, exhibit consistently higher religious involvement in the urban South, and show lower levels of religious involvement in the urban North. Second, in analyzing various types of church attendance (i.e., "weekly," "intermittent," and "infrequent"), we find that African American church attendance is distinctive mainly at an intermittent (e.g., monthly) rather than weekly level. These findings suggest that the rural South produces distinctive patterns of church attendance across racial lines, perhaps reflecting the legacy of segregation and the central importance of the church in rural community life. The markedly different urban patterns by region point to some important areas for further research into the semi-involuntary thesis.

AB This article examines the effects of various demographic and biomedical covariates on the level of prenatal care utilization (Kotelchuck's APNCU) received by U.S. resident women giving birth between the years 1989 and 1991 (N approximate to 10 million). Results from multinominal logistic regression models for thirteen different race/ethnic groups show a strikingly consistent pattern of effects between covariates and the level of prenatal care obtained. Across race/ethnic groups, mothers that were young, low-educated, unmarried, high-parity, and smoked were most at risk of receiving no or inadequate prenatal care. Those women who had experienced a previous preterm or small-for-gestational-age birth or prior infant loss were more likely to receive more extensive ("intensive") care. Presence of a medical risk during pregnancy increased the odds of no/inadequate care and of intensive care. These results support the view that prenatal care intervention strategies can be expected to affect all race/ethnic populations in essentially the same way.

ID GENDER-GAP; EARNINGS; FEMALE; SEX; DYNAMICS; MANAGERS; RACE
AB The popular notion of glass ceiling effects implies that gender (or other) disadvantages are stronger at the top of the hierarchy than at lower levels and that these disadvantages become worse later in a persons career. We define four specific criteria that must be met to conclude that a glass ceiling exists. Using random effects models and data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we examine gender and race inequalities at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of white male earnings. We find evidence of a glass ceiling for women, bia racial inequalities among men do not follow a similar pattern. Thus, we should not describe all systems of differential work rewards as "glass ceilings." They appear to be a distinctively gender phenomenon.

AB Mobility under state socialism has been known for the ubiquitous presence of political criteria in determining career opportunities, but how it evolves in the postsocialist era has yet to be well understood. This article examines the impact of market reform on promotion determination in China's hybrid urban economy. I propose an institutional and organizational explanation, highlighting the difference in resource dependence between firms and nonprofit organizations. I predict that in firms that depend significantly oil market (vis-a-vis the persisting communist party/state) for resources, human capital plays a greater role in determining promotions, while political credential loses ground. Comparative analysis of data collected in two Chinese cities in 1994-95 produces provisional support to these predictions.

ID SEX-DIFFERENCES; REASONING ABILITY; MATH ACHIEVEMENT; PERSPECTIVE;
   VARIABILITY
AB In this article we test the hypothesis that male students outperform female students in mathematics. Using large national data sets and curvilinear growth models we examine gender differences in mathematical trajectories from elementary school through high school. We analyze subsamples of high-scoring students and also different areas of math, such as reasoning and geometry. Despite relatively equal starting points in elementary school, and relatively equal slopes, we find that boys have a faster rate of acceleration. By the 12th grade, this results in a slight gender difference, which is most pronounced in geometry. Realizing this slight and delayed emergence of gender differences, we qualify the strong conclusions of earlier research, such as Benbow and Stanley's (1980, 1983), which found that large gender differences emerge by junior high school.

TI The collapse of Soviet Communism: A class dynamics interpretation
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Concepts of class struggle and social reproduction are used to explain the sudden collapse of Soviet Communism. I explore these ideas by means of the mathematical theory of dynamical systems. Theoretical focus is upon the power of social classes and how this power changes over time. The Soviet bureaucracy gradually divided into two classes, and the power relations between these ruling classes caused a drastic loss of power by both, which is why the Communist system collapsed. Four classes of Soviet society are considered: political class, administrative class, working class, and capitalist class. I examine the reproduction of class power in two-, three-, and four-class systems. Also analyzed are the effects of random perturbations and the particular impact of the August 1991 coup attempt. Wherever possible, graphs are used instead of equations to explain class dynamics. The results indicate that drastic power loss was not the only possible outcome of Soviet class dynamics, which may be why the collapse was so surprising. The class dynamics approach emphasizes multiple historical possibilities and cuts against any rigid class determinism.
   A collapse of the Soviet regime would lead inevitably to the collapse of the planned economy, and thus to the abolition of state property... The fall of the present bureaucratic dictatorship, if it were not replaced by a new socialist power, would thus mean a return to capitalist relations with a catastrophic decline of industry and culture.

AB This article analyzes the effects of workplace social context on managers' and professionals' use of work-family policies in a financial services corporation. These official policies are ambiguous and contested and, as institutional theory implies, may fail to become fully implemented. We use a multilevel model to determine the individual-level and work group-level factors that affect respondents' policy use. In addition to individual- level factors, the social context of the work group affects employees' decisions to use work-family policies. We find support for our hypotheses stressing the social resource of power and protection: employees are more likely to use these policies if they work with powerful supervisors and colleagues, who can buffer them from perceived negative effects on their careers.

AB Organizations exist in a differentiated spatial ecology generated by past foundings and failures and affecting important organizational and individual outcomes. While ecological theory has traditionally emphasized the temporal evolution of organizational populations, this article considers their spatial evolution. Theories of spatial contagion, competition, and density dependence are used to make competing predictions on how geographically delineated subpopulations grow and interact with neighboring subpopulations. The hypotheses are tested on data from the early history of banking in Tokyo, with findings supportive of density dependence within areas and among neighboring areas. This suggests that the spatial evolution of organizational populations is a promising new area for ecological research, with opportunities for better understanding the theoretical and practical problems of spatial clustering and the boundaries of organizational populations.

AB Much of sociological analysis is devoted to assessing the relative importance of ascribed and achieved characteristics for social mobility. In this article, we extend this line of sociological work by focusing on children's differential opportunity to achieve their genetic potential for intellectual development. We hypothesize that the extent to which a child realizes his or her genetic potential depends on socioeconomic environment. Using a large sibling sample collected by the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we test this hypothesis with a variant of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) as the dependent variable. When measures of social environment are considered simultaneously, parental unemployment and ethnicity have a significant effect on the extent to which genetic potential for intellectual development is realized. Our findings suggest that policymakers can help children in disadvantaged environments realize full genetic potential for intellectual development by altering their social circumstances.

   The case of "white flight" schools in Mississippi

LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; DESEGREGATION; MOBILIZATION; PROTEST; STATE
AB This article examines the foundation of private segregationist academies that emerged throughout the U.S. South in the wake of court-ordered desegregation. I focus on the state of Mississippi where private academies grew dramatically from 1969 to 1971. 1 provide an analytic history of civil-rights and school-desegregation conflicts in Mississippi, and I use OLS models to examine county-level variation in local support for private academies during this period. My analysis shows that the formation of academies occurs as a response to desegregation (1) when there is a credible threat that desegregation will be implemented (implicitly signaling the "success" of the movement); (2) when blacks have the organizational capacity to make claims and voice protest within newly desegregated schools, and (3) when whites have the organizational capacity to resist desegregation. These three specifications extend models of racial competition that have been used to explain white countermobilization. I argue that the establishment of academies was a countermovement strategy that flowed out of the prior history of organized white resistance to the civil-rights movement. In other words, whites were not only responding to court intervention and the proportion of African Americans in their community, but to the social movement mobilization of that community.

TI The residential preferences of blacks: Do they explain persistent

SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID RACE; INTERVIEWER; WHITES
AB For many decades, it has been argued that the U.S. remains racially segregated because of discrimination in the real-estate market reflecting whites' desire to isolate themselves from African Americans. The merely modest declines in black-white segregation since the prohibition of such discrimination in 1968 have provoked a competing hypothesis: residential segregation persists because blacks prefer to live in racially isolated neighborhoods and are reluctant to live in largely white areas. These ideas have not been subject to empirical scrutiny.
   We use open- and closed-ended survey data from more than 2,000 African Americans in the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality to examine blacks' preferences and the important related issue of what drives those preferences. We find that African Americans overwhelmingly prefer 50-50 areas, a density far too high for most whites - but their preferences are driven not by solidarity or neutral ethnocentrism but by fears of white hostility. Moreover, almost all blacks are willing to move into largely white areas if there is a visible black presence. White preferences also play a key role, since whites are reluctant to move into neighborhoods with more than a few African Americans.

TI The culture of Mexican migration: A theoretical and empirical analysis
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES
AB Many field investigators have observed the evolution of a "culture of migration"' in certain Mexican communities characterized by a high rate of out-migration to the U.S. Within such communities, international migration becomes so deeply rooted that the prospect of transnational movement becomes normative: young people "expect" to live and work in the U.S. at some point in their lives. Males, especially, come to see migration as a normal part of the life course, representing a marker of the transition to manhood, in addition to being a widely accepted vehicle for economic mobility. International migration is cultural in the sense that the aspiration to migrate is transmitted across generations and between people through social networks. In this article, we develop a formal theory of the culture of migration and test it using a special data set collected by the first author as well as data from the Mexican Migration Project. We show that children from families involved in U.S. migration are more likely to aspire to live and work in the U.S. and that these aspirations, in turn, influence their behavior, lowering the odds that they will continue in school, and raising the odds of their eventual out-migration to the U.S.

AB This article examines the extent to which adolescents' expectations about their future in terms of health and education affect their risk-taking behavior. With data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we test the theory that a "nothing to lose" attitude about the future predicts greater involvement in risky behaviors involving early sexual intercourse, selling drugs, and weapon use. We examine the effects of both individual- and school-level conditions. Results provide mixed support for our "nothing to lose" hypothesis. We do find noteworthy school-level effects of "school climate," including aggregate expectations, mental health, and the prevalence of single-mother families, that influence adolescent risk-taking behavior more than school measures of SES.

ID IDENTITY; VERIFICATION; DEPRESSION; EFFICACY
AB Self-esteem has been conceptualized as an outcome, motive, and buffer, but there is no overall theory of self-esteem. In this article it is suggested that identity theory can provide a theoretical framework for the integration of the various conceptualizations of self-esteem. We suggest that self-esteem is an outcome of, and necessary ingredient in, the self-verification process that occurs within groups, maintaining both the individual and the group. Verification of role identities increases an individual's worth-based and efficacy-based self-esteem. The self-esteem built up by self-velification buffers the negative emotions that occur when self-verification is problematic, thus allowing continued interaction and continuity in structural arrangements during periods of disruption and change. Last, a desire for self-esteem, produced in part through self-verfication, stabilizes the group because it motivates individuals to form and maintain relationships that verify identities.

AB This article analyzes the effect of marketization on personal income inequality in urban China as mediated by three types of work units: low-profit state firms(LPFs), high-profit state firms (HPFs), and market firm (MFs). Results based on two urban survey data sets show that while the influence of redistributive power declines, returns to human capital do not monotonically increase as a firm's proximity to the market increases. Although returns to human capital are higher in the market sector than in the state sector, the effects of education on earnings arc weaker in HPFs than LPFs within the state sector. The inconsistency is attributed to the effects of bonuses that are equally distributed among employees in HPFs.

AB We examine the influence of the relative good health at birth in the Mexican American population on their subsequent well-being. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Child Data (NLSY-CD), we conduct a comparative analysis of child development among Mexican American, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic white children ages 3 and 4 (N = 3,710). We use the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R) as our operationalization of child development. Descriptive results suggest that, unlike the relative similarity in the rates of low birth weight between the white and Mexican American populations, Mexican Americans have much lower developmental outcomes. Multivariate analysis shows that birth weight is not a powerful predictor of child development, nor does it explain pronounced racial and ethnic differences. Mother's education, poverty, and immigrant status of parents remain significantly more important in the developmental process of all children in our sample.

AB Reputational change can occur both posthumously and within a person's lifetime. Championed by reputational entrepreneurs, reputations emerge from competitive fields of interpretive possibilities. The purification of Pete Seeger's image, from vilified Communist to national hero, lets us study both reputational change and the relationship between art and politics. An objectivist model suggests that reputations simply reflect truth. An ideological model claims that Seeger's redemption is shaped by a biased media. Neither sufficiently explains the competitive nature of reputational politics. Our constructionist model takes into account both the role of reputational entrepreneurs and the structural constraints they face. We chart Seeger's reputation through four historical periods: recognition among his peers on the Left (1940s), ruin in the McCarthy period (1950-62), renown among sympathetic subcultures (1960s), and institutionalization as a cultural icon. While it has clear advantages, institutionalization can also have a dampening effect on an artist's oppositional potency.

AB Many of the prevailing theories concerning the relatively low academic performance of African American students tend to center on the attitudes of adolescents. Much less research attention has been paid to the attitudes of younger students. As a result, the image of black adolescents-who, like most American adolescents, exhibit oppositional attitudes-has come to represent much of what we know and take for granted about black students as a group. The findings of this study, based on data collected in an ethnographic study of two all-black elementary schools, suggest that black children begin school very much achievement-oriented and engaged with the process of schooling. These findings provide evidence that the school experience plays a significant role in the development of attitudes toward school.

SO SOCIAL FORCES

ID FORMAL-STRUCTURE; ISOMORPHISM
AB Sociological research on nonprofit organizations has identified several strategies by which nonprofits may respond to environmental challenges. I explicate a strategic response that I call differentiation, and I locate the specific condition under which it is implemented, the condition of competition. I compare the strategic responses adopted by one nonprofit, a large United Way, in two different moments. a period of monopoly and a subsequent period of competition. I show that nonprofits differentiate themselves when facing a crowded market. Differentiation occurs when nonprofits work to convince other actors that they, rather than their competitors, deserve resources. They seek to assert uniqueness and superiority over their rivals by constructing a hierarchical relationship between themselves and others.

SO SOCIAL FORCES

ID FAMILY DISRUPTION; HOMICIDE RATES; CRIME; CONFLICT; INEQUALITY
AB This study examines the relationships between economic and political subordination and the use of lethal force against state officials charged with controlling the underclass. More specifically, it uses count estimators to assess the factors that lead to felonious killings of police officers in the largest U.S. cities. Economic and racial inequality and the presence of a black mayor are used to assess economic and political subordination. Threat effects are measured by the percentage of blacks and by growth in this percentage. With violent crime and social disorganization indicators held constant, the results show that police killings are most likely in cities with the largest differences in black-white resources, but the presence of a black mayor reduces these killings. In a supplemental analysis, the same factors explain the more common injurious assaults against officers. The findings suggest that forms of political subordination increase the probability of violence directed against the street-level state-control agents.

AB Within the sociology of science, there exists a substantial literature showing that males, on average, publish more than females. This literature directs our attention toward organizational contexts and the timing of publication as promising factors bearing on cumulative scholarship outcomes. In this inquiry, based on 2,910 persons who received doctorates in sociology between 1972 and 1976, we isolate the importance of organizational context to explain the emergent and cumulative sex differences in publication outcomes. Our findings reveal that existing scholarship differences between males and females in this cohort occur within the first six years of the doctorate and continue throughout the career as a result of different employment patterns and publication trajectories. Notably, we find support for Robert Merton's contention that context structures the display of individual merit.

AB In this analysis we examine how women's family and employment choices are linked to differences in financial security as they age. Previous research has tested theories of growing inequality, decreasing inequality, or maintained inequality as cohorts transition into old age. We assess these hypotheses for older women and emphasize the heterogeneity in women's experiences, particularly differences in income security among women by race. Our findings indicate that, although marriage offers women considerable financial protection, their own employment was also a key to their security and reduced the rate at which income security decayed as they entered old age. This increased the variation in outcomes relative to initial positions. Whereas marriage provided more security for white women, employment gave a greater boost to black women.

AB This study links the trajectories of adolescents' work values during the transition to adulthood to key indicators of social origin and early experience. The findings, based on panel data from a national sample, indicate that individuals' work values change substantially during this period of the life course, with "average trajectories" of work values indicating some growing realism with age. Furthermore, work value trajectories are systematically tied to social or in and early experience, with gender and race playing a particularly important role both in initial adolescent work values and in changes that occur across the young adult years. The work values of young black women, for example, changed the most as they came to terms with their occupational opportunities.

ID SEASONAL MIGRATION; TRANSITION; AMERICANS; BIRTH
AB Using retrospective fertility and migration histories from a binational study of Mexico-U.S. migration, we test for the presence of separation, assimilation, adaptation, diffusion, and selectivity effects of migration on annual birth probabilities and completed fertility. Our results reveal that spousal separation due to temporary migration reduces birth probabilities in the short term but does not reduce marital fertility in the long term. However, when women migrate to the U.S. either as temporary migrants or as long-term settled migrants, their experiences lead to lower birth probabilities while in the U.S. as well as to fewer total births. By contrast, U.S. migration experience among men who return to Mexico is associated with higher marital fertility in Mexico, suggesting that temporary migrants are selected for higher fertility.

AB This article investigates the influence of participation in and exposure to voluntary associations on fertility-limiting behavior. Its theoretical framework, drawn from the sociological literature on social networks and voluntary associations, the demographic literature on program participation, and the literature on health behavior, delineates the mechanisms through which participation in voluntary associations is likely to influence permanent contraceptive use. The article draws from three data sources to empirically test the framework: individual-level survey data from couples residing in the Chitwan Valley in south-central Nepal; data on the neighborhoods of the Chitwan Valley collected using an integrated application of ethnographic, survey, and archival methods; and the authors' own ethnographic interviews in these neighborhoods. Empirical analyses show that participation in a range of voluntary associations increases permanent contraceptive use. Furthermore, living in a neighborhood with a voluntary association increases permanent contraceptive use. Finally, participation in different types of voluntary associations-including creditgroups, women's groups, agricultural groups, and youth groups-appears to be similarly related to permanent contraceptive Use.

AB What can the scholarship on gender teach us about studying difference and dealing with diversity in our professional and personal lives? Here, I first describe the expansion of research on gender over the last 30 years. This research has grown not only in its representation in our journals, but also in the types of differences it considers - between women and men, among women (and among men), and across national boundaries. Next, I discuss some of the lessons we learn from this research: to study difference in its own context, make real comparisons, look for similarities as well as differences, examine variation within as well as between groups, investigate exceptions, note failure to find effects, allow for equifinality, and move up a level in abstraction to go beyond gender as a category per se. These lessons about moving between the specific and the general can help us understand processes creating inequality. Finally, I illustrate how we can apply these lessons in our teaching and service.

AB Relationship timing can have dramatic effects on diffusion through a network, as relationship order determines transmission routes. Though past research has modeled diffusion through static networks or developed methods for modeling change in network patterns, none has combined these factors to show how relationship change channels diffusion. This article formalizes the diffusion problem in networks with changing relations, identifies minimal bounds needed to measure diffusion potential in such networks, and provides a method for identifying who is at risk for diffusion. The effect of timing for diffusion potential is demonstrated with potential flow of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in an adolescent romantic network.

SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID CONSTRUCTION; SOCIOLOGY; CULTURE; MEDIA; NEWS
AB Building on Helen MacGill Hughes's News and the Human Interest Story, we examine how human interest stories create collective attention, essential for the establishment of a public or demos, and the limitations of that process. Although human interest stories are not unique in this regard, such stories encourage shared identification, important for social cohesion and the maintenance of a public sphere. However, since the embedded story is presented as one that is not perceived as having lasting societal impact, it directs attention away from political action. We present four processes through which human interest stories operate. (1) media placement - how media structure and occupational interests produce stories that capture reader loyalty, (2) identification potential - the creation of scenes and personae that audiences feel they "know" and with which they can identify, (3) narrative arc - the process by which a story maintains reader interest, exposing conflicts and changes in likely outcomes, and (4) discursive space - the role of moral issues, provoking discussion and the possibility of active involvement of audiences. To explore these processes we analyze the case of Floyd Collins, the Kentucky caver trapped for seventeen days in 1925, and detail the associated media frenzy.

   DETERMINANTS; PARTICIPATION
AB Various studies have hypothesized that neighborhood attachment - defined as a multidimensional concept composed of attitudes, neighboring, and problem solving is linked to local stressors in ways that vary by the type of attachment under examination. My study analyzes the effects of four stressors on six dimensions of attachment and shows that social and physical disorder as well as experiences with victimization and crime do not uniformly decrease individual neighborhood attachment. Social disorder has the most widespread negative impact on different types of neighborhood attachment. My results also show that victimization and perceptions of crime affect only problem solving; indeed, they actually increase this form of attachment. This finding suggests that a multidimensional approach to neighborhood attachment is useful, especially when applied to theories of social disorganization and loss of community.

AB The urban and educational literature has recently begun to focus on the increase of concentrated poverty in inner-city neighborhoods and the educational failure of youth often associated with living in these neighborhoods. The current study examines this issue by identifying which neighborhood characteristics influence educational achievement and what mechanisms mediate these associations. Using the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988 linked to 1990 census information at the neighborhood level, the current study finds not only that neighborhood characteristics predict educational outcomes but also that the strength of the predictions often rivals that associated with more commonly cited family- and school-related factors. When considering how neighborhood characteristics influence educational outcomes, theorists have proposed several mediating processes, including collective socialization, social control, social capital, perception of opportunity, and institutional characteristics. The current study reveals that these mediators account for about 40% of the neighborhood effect on educational achievement, with collective socialization having the strongest influence. Also discussed are the theoretical and policy implications of this study and directions for future research.

SO SOCIAL FORCES

ID SCHOOL-FINANCE; INEQUALITY; POVERTY; AREAS
AB Economic segregation increased in the U.S. between 1970 and 1990. Three hypotheses suggest that economic segregation affects low-income children's educational attainment, but they provide different predictions about the direction of the effect. I combine census data with data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to show that an increase in economic segregation between census tracts in the same state hardly changes overall educational attainment but it exacerbates inequality between high-income and low-income children. With overall inequality held constant changes in economic inequality within census tracts have little effect on low-income children's educational attainment. But changes in inequality between census tracts reduce the educational attainment Of low-income children. Substituting segregation between school districts for segregation between census tracts yields the same conclusions.

AB This study seeks to explain the adoption of civil rights legislation across periods of insurgency as well as relative quiescence. The historically grounded thesis I advance argues that within a context of public apathy, dramatic events generate the "first wave" of civil rights concessions. These early policy successes, however, set in motion a sequence of events that both diminish the role of dramatic events and heighten the role of conventional political processes in subsequent "second wave" legislation. Time-series analyses of equal employment legislation are consistent with this "dramatic events-conventional politics" approach. I find that black protests and segregationist violence prompted legislation up to the breakthrough 1964 act but that public opinion played the dominant role up to the passage of the landmark 1972 act.

ID STRATIFICATION; LEISURE; GENDER
AB Although some sociologists still connect cultural preferences with social class, others argue that postindustrial societies are no longer class-based societies and that contemporary cultural consumption patterns do not simply reflect class positions. This article addresses several theories that characterize the association between class and cultural consumption in contemporary society. It goes on to analyze the effect of class position on highbrow cultural consumption - using both leisure activities and cultural tastes - in Italy, Sweden, West Germany, Israel, and the U.S. It asks whether differences in cultural consumption, given other salient cleavages such as race/ethnicity, gender, and religious observance, are associated with class. Results show that class correlates with highbrow cultural consumption in different ways in the cases studied. The dividing line for consuming highbrow culture is located at the top of the class structure in Israel, the U.S., and Sweden; it is located at the bottom of the class structure in Italy and West Germany. Gender, race, and religious observance are important in conditioning culture consumption, but they do not fully mediate the association between class and cultural tastes.

ID MEXICAN-AMERICANS; RACE; ETHNICITY; IDENTITY
AB Recent studies have examined the implications of exposure to U.S. race relations for the racial and ethnic identities of migrants to the U.S. Most investigations are based exclusively on U.S. data. There are few, if any, comparisons of the identities of migrants and their offspring to those of nonmigrants in their country of origin. Using data from a survey of Puerto Rican mothers in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, this study provides such a comparison. Responses to an open-ended race question show that mainland and island Puerto Ricans most often designate their "race" as Puerto Rican, but responses of women who do not self-identify as Puerto Rican diverge between the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Island women primarily identify themselves as white, black, or triguena, while mainland women identify themselves as Hispanic/Latina, Hispanic American, or American. Mainland-island differences cannot be explained by parental ethnicity, skin tone, demographic factors, and socioeconomic status. The findings suggest that mainland Puerto Ricans more strongly reject the conventional U.S. notion of race than do their island counterparts.

   RACE; SUPERVISORS; INEQUALITY; WORKPLACE; TURNOVER
AB This article examines whether ethnic concentration in establishments, occupations, and industries influences the authority attainment of white, black, Hispanic, and Asian men and women. Data from the Multi-City Survey of Urban Inequality and the 1990 decennial census indicate that "horizontal" concentration among roughly equivalent coworkers and within local industrial and occupational sectors has little effect on minority chances of accessing positions of authority. However, "vertical" concentration in the form of racial/ethnic matching of supervisors to subordinate work groups exerts a strong and consistent effect among all groups, implying that authority attainment depends a great deal on the opportunity to supervise largely coethnic work groups. We conceptualize this "ethnic matching" of supervisors to subordinates as a kind of "sticky floor" that binds individual opportunity for work place authority to the structural opportunity to exercise control over members of one's own race and ethnicity.

ID SELF-EMPLOYMENT; ECONOMIC-ACTION; DETERMINANTS; NETWORKS; JOB;
   EMBEDDEDNESS; RESOURCES; MIGRATION; PATTERNS
AB We study how the social capital and closure properties of family- and ethnic-based social networks influence the incorporation of immigrants into their host society. In so doing, we examine the relationship between immigrants' reliance on social ties and their employment. Data collected through ethnographic depth interviews of Asian immigrants in Los Angeles indicate that reliance on social ties usually operates informally, as when job seekers consult their more experienced and better-connected friends, relatives, and acquaintances and ask them to serve as intermediaries. These networks provide group-based resources that assist immigrants in making headway in their new society. Yet reliance on social ties is most common for moves into jobs of low occupational prestige that have low human capital requirements. Because of linguistic and cultural competence, immigrants who seek jobs from coethnic employers are often more self-reliant in the job search than those who seek work more broadly. In this way, ethnolinguistic closure encourages ethnic segmentation in the labor market. By contrast, reliance on social ties, another form of closure, facilitates job hunting in the wider domain of the labor market, where prospective employers may be of any ethnicity. Reliance on social ties thereby provides a mechanism by which immigrants gain employment throughout the multiethnic metropolitan, labor market.

Health measures include perceived health, energy and fitness, physical impairment, chronic conditions, and aches and pains. Results show a generally positive association between health and age at first birth that is linear for men and parabolic for women, with maximum health predicted for mothers who had a first birth around age 30.5. The correlation of parenthood with health depends on age at first birth, switching from negative to positive with delay beyond age 21.8.

AB This article considers the direct impact of political parties, interest groups, and social movement organizations (SMOs) on policy, providing evidence for a "core" hypothesis and three others that refine or qualify it. The core hypothesis: all three types of organizations have substantial impacts on policy. The other three: (1) when public opinion is taken into account, the political organizations do not have such an impact; (2) parties have a greater impact than interest groups and SMOs; and (3) interest groups and SMOs will affect policy only to the extent that their activities provide elected officials with information and resources relevant to their election campaigns. The source of data is articles published in major sociology and political science journals from 1990 to 2000, systematically coded to record the impact of organizations on policy. The major findings include. political organizations affect policy no more than half the time; parties and nonparty organizations affect policy about equally often; there is some evidence that organizational activities that respond to the electoral concerns of elected officials are especially likely to have an impact.

   SOCIOLOGY; MIGRATION; NETWORKS
AB Foreign direct investment (FDI) is considered a powerful catalyst in market transition. However, FDI flows vary greatly across Central and East European transition countries. I compare and contrast current approaches, which consider country characteristics as determinants of FDI, with a relational approach that emphasizes institutional, political, economic, and cultural connections between investor and host countries. Regression analyses of FDI flows,in country dyads provide little evidence for the effects of country characteristics. Political, migration, trade, and cultural relations between investors and hosts have strong positive effects on FDI flows, and they add considerably to the proportion of the explained cross-national variance. These findings highlight the utility of a relational understanding of macroeconomic processes, as well as the importance of examining how substantively different social relations shape economic exchange.

ID WORLD-SYSTEMS-ANALYSIS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; ECONOMIC-GROWTH
AB Although there have been heated debates over globalization and regionalization, refined empirical research has been lacking. Defining globalization and regionalization as specific types of linkages between countries, we attempt to empirically examine the following. (1) Has the world been globalized and/or regionalized? and (2) If it has, what are the consequences of these processes? To explore these questions, we analyze longitudinal data on international commodity trade using the social network approach. Data analysis shows that the world became increasingly globalized between 1959 and 1996 in the sense that each country studied traded with more countries in 1996 than in 1959. As a result, the world trade network became denser. At the core of this process has been the development of countries in the middle strata. We also find that the Structure of the world trade network became decentralized over time, a change that provides greater support for neoclassical economic theory than for world-system/dependency theory. Regarding regionalization, we find that intraregional density is greater than interregional density and that intraregional ties are stronger than interregional ones. Moreover, both intraregional and interregional density increased significantly between 1959 and 1996, indicating, first, that the flow of world trade became regionalized and, second, that globalization and regionalization are not contradictory processes.

   POLITICS; LABOR; WOMEN; POLICY; ORGANIZATION; EDUCATION
AB State theorists have examined the gender implications of various New Deal social policies, but few researchers have analyzed federal job training programs, which formed a key component of New Deal policies. Drawing on different theories of the state I analyze whether federal policy goals matched local policy outcomes (n =337 counties) in three southern states. Federal vocational policy expanded educational opportunities during the New Deal, but it did so in a gender-specific manner fundamentally shaped by structural changes in the region's economy. Thus, results are mixed. Policy outcomes matched goals in the sense that women's access to vocational training remained narrowly constrained, despite increased funding for women's programs. Additional funds mostly benefitted men's programs. But contrary to congressional intent, access to programs remained disconnected from local labor markets. Instead, employment opportunities in the domestic sector had a profound impact on enrollment dynamics, while changes in the organization of production via mechanization and industrialization made vocational programs more male dominated than ever.

AB Unlike commonsense notions and the findings from animal research, the literature concerning the effects of density on human social behavior is paralyzed by contradictory findings. This article examines empirically two fundamental issues which could account for this and which are central to the density-crowding debate: (1) whether observed crowding effects are the result of causation or selection and (2) whether individuals are negatively affected by both low and high levels of density. Data from the Toronto Mental Health and Stress study are analyzed using structural equation modeling to investigate these questions. The results support the notion that the effects of density on aggressive and withdrawn behavior are nonlinear in nature. The findings further reveal a self-selection of respondents into particular forms of housing. The implications of these findings for future research on crowding are discussed.

TI Intimacy as a double-edged phenomenon? An empirical test of Giddens
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID PURE RELATIONSHIP
AB In a series of books published since 1990, Anthony Giddens has explored the impact of globalization on the personal relationships and inner lives of those living in the advanced capitalist societies of the West. Of particular interest to him have been intimate, sexual relationships, which he views as tending, under the weight of globalization, away from a "traditional" model and toward a "posttraditional" form in which the relationship is seen as a means to self-development and is expected to be dissolved when it no longer serves this purpose. These posttraditional or "pure love" relationships, Giddens argues, hold great promise for human freedom and happiness, but are so unpredictable that they also threaten to overwhelm people with anxiety and lead them to engage in compensatory addictive behaviors. This article empirically examines Giddens's claims. Data come from a nationally representative survey of Americans in midlife. Results show that people in pure love relationships reap the rewards to which Giddens points, but experience few of the negative side effects. The theoretical implications of the findings are considered.

TI Racial threat and social control: A test of the political, economic, and

AB The often observed association between the size of the black population and the amount of social control imposed on blacks has been interpreted as consistent with one of three conceptually distinct perspectives: (1) the political threat hypothesis, (2) the economic threat hypothesis, and (3) the threat of black crime hypothesis. Although these three hypotheses advance differing conceptualizations of threat, adjudicating between them has proven difficult. The current study uses county-level data drawn from South Carolina's National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), race-specific voting data, and demographic data to investigate the validity of each of these racial threat hypotheses. Results from a pooled cross-sectional time-series analysis show that black-on-white crime has a substantive positive effect on black arrest levels. In contrast, no such effect is observed for black-on-black crime. These findings taken together furnish strong support for the threat of black crime hypothesis. The curvilinear relationship between the ratio of black-to-white votes cast in a general election and black arrest levels hypothesized by the political threat hypothesis does not hold for the data analyzed. Additionally, we find no empirical support for the economic threat hypothesis. The implications of these findings are discussed.

   PUNISHMENT; FAMILY; DISCRIMINATION; EXPLANATIONS; UNDERCLASS
AB Most studies of jail or prison sentence length focus on whether offender characteristics produce sentencing differentials after legal effects have been controlled, but the findings in the literature have not been consistent, probably because most studies have been based on a few jurisdictions. To see if political effects explain these discrepancies, this study of 337 jurisdictions in seven states analyzes interaction effects between external political influences and offender attributes after holding constant multiple individual and environmental factors. To adjust for censoring, Tobit is used to analyze the length of sentences, while state differences are held constant with state-specific dummy variables. When interaction terms are not included, the results are consistent with prior research. But the inclusion of political interactions produces findings suggesting that African Americans and males receive longer sentences when local courts are embedded in conservative political environments where a law-and-order presidential candidate received more votes. These results support theoretical claims that punishment is an intensely political process.

AB Dramatic changes in the age distribution of suicide in the U.S. are associated with variations in the demographic characteristics of birth cohorts. Using an age-period-cohort-characteristic model, we show that cohort characteristics theoretically linked to integration and regulation have substantively strong and statistically significant relationships with changes in age-specific suicide rates from 1930 to 1995. Members of relatively large cohorts and of cohorts with higher percentages of nonmarital births are at greater risk for suicide throughout their life spans. These results appear for the total population and for race-sex subgroups, even though the age distributions of suicide differ substantially across these demographic groups. They can account for recent sharp increases in youth suicide, as well as more moderate increases in earlier decades.

AB The relationship between women's employment and the risk of divorce is both complex and controversial. The role specialization (or interdependence) view of marriage argues that the gains to marriage for both partners decrease when both are in the labor force, and hence women's employment destabilizes marriage. In contrast, the economic opportunity hypothesis asserts that female labor force participation does not intrinsically weaken marriage, but gives women resources that they can use to leave unsatisfactory marriages. Here we use data from the two waves of the National Survey of Families and Households to conduct the first large-scale empirical test of those conflicting claims. Our results provide clear evidence that, at the individual level, women's employment does not destabilize happy marriages but increases the risk of disruption in unhappy marriages.

AB This article compares and comments on the "two sociologies," that of the journals and monographs and that of the introductory textbooks. The principal concern is with the treatments of race, ethnicity, and religion. The principal argument is that the categorical usages found in the textbooks hide significant ongoing social changes. To address these questions we present data from the 1972-98 NORC General Social Surveys. The evidence presented does not support a range of standard claims found in the five leading textbooks. Those textbooks do not adequately reflect well-known findings reported in the discipline's specialties.

AB Despite serious methodological problems, quantitative studies of poverty by U.S. sociologists predominantly rely on the official U.S. measure. After reviewing the shortcomings of the U.S. measure, this article examines several theoretical and methodological advances in poverty measurement. After synthesizing literature on poverty measurement, I argue that ideal measures of poverty should: (1) measure comparative historical variation effectively; (2) be relative rather than absolute; (3) conceptualize poverty as social exclusion; (4) assess the impact of taxes, transfers, and state benefits, and (5) integrate the depth of poverty and the inequality among the poor. Next, this article evaluates sociological studies published since 1990 for their consideration of these criteria. Due to sociology's neglect of these criteria, this article advocates for three alternative poverty indices: the interval measure, the ordinal measure, and the sum of ordinals measure. Finally, using the Luxembourg Income Study, I examine the empirical patterns with these three measures, across advanced capitalist democracies from 1967 to 1997. Estimates of these poverty indices are made available for future research.

AB The history of criminological thought has seen several theories that attempt to link community conditions and individual-level processes. However, a comparative analysis of contextual effects has not been undertaken. This article estimates a multilevel model that examines the effects of variables derived from three delinquency theories. The results indicate that youths residing in areas of high male joblessness who experience stressful life events or little parental supervision are especially likely to be involved in delinquent behavior. The attenuating impact of school involvement on delinquency is more pronounced in urban environments low in male joblessness. These results suggest that examining the contextual implications of delinquency theories is important, but theories need to be developed with more attention to specific contextual processes.

AB Little empirical research exists on major changes in the strategies and tactics of social movements, but some researchers argue that organizational readiness and political opportunities produce such changes. This article examines the circumstances that led some state woman suffrage movements to use a bold new tactic, the suffrage parade, beginning in the early twentieth century. An event-history analysis reveals that organizational readiness and political opportunities had little to do with change in the suffragists' strategic approach. Rather, the change occurred when movements consisted of a diverse assortment of organizations, when movement organizations were less centrally structured, when conflict existed among movement members, when movements engaged in fundraising, and when the suffragists had recently experienced significant political defeat. The model of tactical change presented here better explains the impetuses for such a shift than do earlier explanations.

AB While the scholarship on internal labor markets and promotion chances has contributed substantially to the sociology of organizations and labor markets, it has not developed a rich understanding of how career trajectories are influenced by the firm's competitive position in its product market. Our central claim is that a firm's implicit bargaining power over its employees depends on its product market position and its sensitivity to environmental change. The greater the firm's bargaining power, the less the firm will be compelled to use promotions as a device to induce productivity. Firms occupying robust competitive positions should have greater bargaining power in the labor market and be less likely to fill vacancies through internal promotions. Analyses of promotion rates among top managers in a longitudinal sample of television stations support our thesis.

AB We test the hypothesis inspired by Mead and Cooley, that one's self-perceptions are an internalization of the perceptions of the views of others, using a large set of network data from 56 naturally occurring communities. The results are compatible with an internalization model, whereby self-conceptions are instilled through interaction with high-status alters. Yet it does not seem that personality is simply an impression made in a malleable mind by the force of social Interaction-examination of longitudinal data demonstrates that over time, it is possible for individuals to bring others around to their self-conceptions, presumably because they are able to build up a reputation through consistent acts.

   RACE COMPOSITION; METROPOLITAN-AREAS; BLACK-WHITE; ORGANIZATIONS;

AB Previous research on the devaluation of women's work has investigated whether the net effect of gender composition varies across Jobs and organizational settings. We extend that research by using hierarchical linear models that combine data from a random sample of U.S. work establishments with metropolitan-area data to explore whether macro-level gender inequality also influences the tendency to devalue women's work roles. Thus, we offer the first attempt to examine processes that lead to organizational gender inequality in local labor market contexts. Specifically, we hypothesize that gender devaluation will be strongest in highly gender-segregated labor markets. One reason for this may be that in segregated markets, men are in a stronger position to benefit from devaluation while women are less able to resist it. The results strongly support this hypothesis: Higher levels of occupational segregation at the labor market level are associated with a significantly increased tendency to devalue women's work roles. This finding is not explained by a diverse set of controls at both the establishment and local labor market level. Our findings highlight an additional way that gender segregation intensifies labor market inequality.

AB This article introduces the theoretical approaches of contact, group conflict, and symbolic prejudice to explain levels of exclusionary feelings toward a relatively new minority in the West European context, the immigrant. The findings indicate that even after controls for perceived threat are included in the model, intimate contact with members of minority groups in the form of friendships can reduce levels of willingness to expel legal immigrants from the country. A contextual variable, level of immigration to the country, is also introduced into the model because it is likely that this variable affects both threat perception and exclusionary feelings. While context does not seem to directly affect levels of willingness to expel or include immigrants in the society, it does have a rather powerful impact on perceived threat. Perhaps even more importantly, the findings suggest that contact mediates the effect of the environment, helping to produce lower levels of threat perception in contexts of high immigration.

ID EQUITY; DEMOGRAPHICS
AB Although many models of urban racial inequality make predictions about the geographic distribution of social groups and social goods, these predictions are rarely tested spatially. This is because (1) it can be extremely difficult to measure geographic distance using social science datasets and (2) when studying residential segregation, researchers generally measure the total extent of segregation in a region rather than the distribution of racial and ethnic groups within a region. This article overcomes these problems by introducing a geographic information system (GIS) variable construction technique that allows researchers to measure the distance between social groups and goods more precisely than is otherwise possible and by demonstrating the importance of using maps to examine the distribution of social groups and goods within metropolitan areas.

AB Although social support is a static concept, its basic dynamic properties-decay, growth, and staticity-involve different underlying social processes, and therefore have differential effects on mental health. Using a sample of 11,835 adolescents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, I conduct a series of regression analyses of depression on these properties of support. As hypothesized, the positive effect of support decay on depression is stronger than the negative effect of support growth. Results imply that, for those in an adolescent's social environment, it is important to take a proactive rather than a reactive approach to managing adolescent depression. Future research should adopt a framework that treats the distribution of social resources as dynamic in nature, and that is sensitive to contrasting processes this give rise to opposite mental health outcomes.

AB Collective action can be problematic for two reasons-we may get little or no additional benefit from our own efforts should we choose to contribute (the "efficacy problem"), yet we will enjoy the benefits of others' efforts even if we fail to contribute (the ''free-rider problem"). Movement mobilizers address the free-rider problem by issuing crisis messages that call attention to impending disaster and the urgent need for action. These messages discourage free riding by making clear that soon there may be no more public resources to enjoy for free. Mobilizers address the efficacy problem by issuing empowerment messages that emphasize the fact that positive change is possible and is, in fact, happening. Crisis messages are especially prominent in the "tragedy of the commons" because of the accelerating impact of overconsumption. The "mobilizer's dilemma" is that crisis messages may actually backfire by undermining belief in the ability to "make a difference," while empowerment messages affirm efficacy but encourage free riding. We tested the hypothesized effects of crisis and empowerment messages under controlled conditions in the laboratory. In two separate experiments, members of a large group were confronted with a resource depletion problem under conditions of uncertainty. We manipulated the content of persuasive messages and measured the effect on self-restraint in harvesting the commons. The results confirmed the mobilizer's dilemma and-pointed to a way out.

Our findings suggest that men and women do experience free time very differently. Men tend to have more of it. Marriage and children exacerbate the gender gap and market work hours erode men's and women's free time in different ways. Our findings reveal that despite gains toward gender equality in other domains, discrepancies persist in the experience of free time.

ID UNITED-STATES; BEHAVIOR; FAMILY; WOMEN
AB Using two waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study examines two sets of relationships between attitudes, religiosity, and first sex among adolescents. First, I estimate the effects of religiosity and attitudes about sex on the likelihood of engaging in first sex. Then, I estimate the effect of having sex on subsequent religiosity and attitudes. The findings are consistent with past research that finds attitudes are a significant predictor of sexual activity. The effect of religiosity on first sex is mediated by attitudes about sex. Regarding reciprocal effects, having sex for the first time has a significant effect on later attitudes, but not religiosity. This study highlights the importance of going beyond traditional, recursive models that consider only one side of a causal relationship.

TI A party of workers or a party of intellectuals? Recruitment into Eastern
   European Communist Parties, 1945-1988
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper provides an event-history analysis of recruitment into the Communist Party between 1945 and 1988 in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech and Slovak Socialist Republics. Despite evidence that gender discrimination in Party recruitment processes eased in some of these countries, women remained significantly less likely than men to enter the political arena via the Communist Party across the region. The findings also indicate that class background and parents' political affiliation figured less prominently in Party recruitment processes in Eastern Europe over time. Prior incumbency in a position of authority, including that of supervisor, not only had a positive effect on the odds of joining the Party but was greater than the effect of prior professional status, indicating that professionals were not especially likely to join the Party in Eastern Europe despite open efforts to recruit technically trained personnel. Education, however, had a large and stable effect on Party recruitment, with the absence of change in the coefficients for education across time suggesting that communist authorities imposed educational criteria on new recruits from their first years in power. Overall, the findings indicate the existence of two paths of entry into the Communist Parties of Eastern Europe, one through educational institutions and the other up the vertical chain of command within the workplace.

   RURAL CHINA; STRATIFICATION; ECONOMIES; POLITICS; REDISTRIBUTION;

AB In this article, we examine the relationship between market transition and gender gap in earnings in urban China. We analyze change in the gender gap in human capital, political capital, labor-force placement, and family structure; change in the amount Of monetary return to these determinants; and the changing significance of these sources of influence. We do so by analyzing two national samples from the 1988 and 1995 Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP) and city-level data for 1995. We found no longitudinal change nor city-level variation in the gender gap in earnings. Despite this stability, the proportion of the gender gap in earnings attributable to education and occupational segregation increased over time. This change is disproportional, occurring largely only in the most marketized cities. In these highly marketized cities, the significance of market-related mechanisms - education and occupation and industry-placement - has increased, while the contribution of redistribution-related mechanisms - affiliation with the state sector, party membership, and seniority - has decreased. These changes indicate that the Chinese market transition is a nonlinear, cumulative process.

ID INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION; UNITED-STATES; REMITTANCES; COMMUNITIES;

AB Using a sample of 1, 112 heads of household from the Mexican Migration Project (MMP), I develop a multinomial logit regression to test the hypothesis that migrants with social ties to other migrants in their place of settlement will have a greater risk Of investing their remittances and savings on a productive activity or a home than of spending them on consumption. I find that migrants who live with family members or townspeople during their last migration trip have a higher risk of investing their savings on a productive activity or a home relative to spending them on consumption. Migrants who belong to a social club with other migrants have a higher risk of investing their remittances on production or housing than of using them for consumption.

ID PART-TIME WORK; HOURS CONSTRAINTS; LABOR; UNDEREMPLOYMENT; TRENDS; JOB;
   ECONOMICS; AMERICANS; BEHAVIOR; MARKET
AB Data from the 1997 International Social Survey Programme show that a majority of U.S. employees prefer to work a different number of hours than they actually work. Employees are divided in their preferences: many want to spend less time at work, but there are also many who want to increase their hours. These preferences vary with such characteristics as gender, age, family structure, income, opportunities for advancement, and part-time status. One surprising result is that family structures associated with work-family conflict are not associated with a desire for fewer hours. Members of dual-earner couples without children and male breadwinners without children are most likely to desire fewer hours. This analysis suggests that work-family conflict is more likely to produce a desire for fewer hours when employees are well off economically.

AB Relatively little research has explored sex inequality in careers across evolving segments of professional labor markets, a line of inquiry warranted given the growth Of secondary Jobs within and women's inroads into these segmenting professions. I examine whether women advance more slowly than men within the law academic labor market and, if so, what factors explain these sex differences. Several stories emerge from the analysis. Women move more slowly than men across the secondary-primary Job boundary in law academia, but neither choice nor structure, alone, accounts for women's slower rates of movement. Instead, sex differences in mobility rates appear to reflect a mixture of factors, including family and geographic constraints, social capital, employment origins, and the structure of opportunity within the secondary labor market.

AB Numerous role shifts occur between the ages of 55 and 74 as individuals typically relinquish paid work and some family roles and make choices about how to use their expanding discretionary time. Using data from the first two waves of the Americans' Changing Lives survey, we examine the association between paid work status and formal and informal volunteer activity. No evidence for an association between paid work status and informal volunteering is found, suggesting that helping friends, neighbors, and relatives occurs independent of constraints associated with paid work. A relationship is established for formal volunteering, however. Among individuals who were not volunteering for formal organizations at the time of the first interview, those who worked part-time, those who had not worked in either wave, as well as those who stopped work between interviews were significantly more involved in volunteering than were full-time workers.

AB How power is extended vertically through hierarchies and horizontally through industrial networks and markets is a classic issue in sociology that was once extensively studied by Weber. Yet it is little studied today. Definitions of power exclude power exercise beyond the single relation, as does research in exchange networks. In contrast, research in organizations recognizes the extension of power, but offers no theory to explain how it is produced or to identify the conditions which might further or impede it. Here the extension of power beyond the single relationship is called power-at-a-distance. New theory offering metric predictions is applied to power-at-a-distance in exchange networks. That theory identifies the conditions that extend power beyond the dyad and the conditions that tend to block that extension. Five experiments on contrasting structures broadly support those predictions. Relations between power-at-a-distance and power centralization are theorized. Practical problems of extending power are addressed and further research is proposed.

AB Conversation is both rule-governed and a venue in which people are differentiated, in how they act and are acted toward. I propose a new framework for the analysis Of conversational sequences that captures both aspects simultaneously, based on the concept of participation shift. This refers to the moment-by-moment shuffling of individuals between the "participation statuses" of speaker, target, and unaddressed recipient. An analysis of participation shifts in meetings of thirteen managerial groups reveals the operation of sequential rules that limit who can speak and be addressed in a given turn; several dimensions along which individuals are differentiated in terms of their participation shift involvements; and effects of conversational context on individuals' sequential tendencies. The analysis bridges conversation-analytic concerns with the sequential production of talk and small-group researchers' interest in conversational discrimination and points to several new lines of micro-sociological research.

ID SAMPLE SELECTION BIAS; OFFICIAL REACTIONS; CRIME RATES; BLACKS
AB Although blacks are arrested disproportionately for most types of violent crimes, disagreement persists as to the extent to which official arrest data are indicative of differential offending behavior or selection bias on the part of law enforcement personnel. Using data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), we assess the effect of an offender's race on the probability of arrest for 335,619 incidents of forcible rape, robbery, and assault in 17 states during 1999. The baseline model for these comparisons is the equiprobability hypothesis that relative to violation frequency as reported by crime victims, the likelihood of arrest for white and black offenders is roughly equal. Multivariate logistic regression results show that the odds Of arrest for white offenders is approximately 22% higher for robbery, 13% higher for aggravated assault, and 9% higher for simple assault than they are for black offenders. An offender's race plays no noteworthy role in the likelihood of arrest for the crime of forcible rape. These findings suggest that the disproportionately high arrest rate for black citizens is most likely attributable to differential involvement in reported crime rather than to racially biased law enforcement practices.

AB I examine the relationship of labor and housing market conditions to marriage, living alone, living with a partner, living with roommates, or living with parents among persons aged 18-30. Although the residential choices available to contemporary young adults undermine the uniqueness of marriage, I find that marriage retains a high material standard. I also find that the material foundations of nonmarital arrangements differ. Housing costs are strongly associated with domestic arrangements: in areas with higher housing costs, relatively expensive arrangements are less common. These patterns appear in broad brush for blacks and whites and males and females; however, I also observe important racial differences. My results suggest that the interaction of structural context with consumption aspirations is an important influence on domestic life in the transition to adulthood.

AB This study advances sociological theory by elaborating on the significance of social integration into a family for parent and offspring well-being. The study assesses the extent to which changes in the psychological well-being of young adults engender changes in their parents' psychological well-being, and vice versa. The results suggest that the relationship is reciprocal; changes in a young adult's psychological well-being affect the psychological well-being of a parent. Similarly, changes in a parent's feelings of well-being affect those of a young adult offspring.

TI Alternative routes in the remarriage market: Competing-risk analyses of

AB We examine the social, economic, and cultural determinants of "repartnering" after a divorce. Our analysis improves upon earlier research in three ways: (1) our study includes more direct measures of theoretical concepts; (2) we study both marriage and cohabitation after divorce and analyze them as competing risks; (3) we incorporate information about the meeting setting in our event-history models. Competing-risk models estimated on a large-scale sample of ever-divorced persons in the Netherlands offer limited support for economic theories of marriage. Stronger support is obtained for social theories of marriage, which emphasize the role of meeting and mating opportunities in the "remarriage market," and for cultural theories of marriage, which stress the importance of individualistic orientations.

ID INSTITUTION; IMPULSE; LIFE
AB This analytical article develops a framework to examine how contemporary young adults approach work, family, and their own personal futures, by building upon a program of research involving in-depth interviews with advanced law and MBA students. I argue that the sociology of work and family could be greatly enhanced by taking account of the shifting nature of the self in light of transformations over recent decades associated with the new individualism, changes in gender roles and family life, and the demise of stable career trajectories for professionals and managers. An elaborated version of Zurcher's thesis about the mutable self is presented as a means for understanding how young adults in succeeding generations will go about defining institutional commitments across the life course.

ID PUBLIC-GOODS; COLLECTIVE ACTION; COMMONS DILEMMA; RISK-TAKING; BEHAVIOR;
   COMMUNICATION; EVOLUTION; EXCHANGE; WOMEN; ROLES
AB Results from previous studies have led many researchers to conclude that sex has no effect on cooperation in social dilemmas. This article reconciles strong theoretical expectations of sex differences in cooperation with the dearth of empirical evidence for such differences. I show that several theories of sex- or gender-related behavior suggest we should expect males and females to respond more strongly to greed and fear, respectively, in social dilemmas. I argue that previous research has failed to find differences because researchers have consistently used the Prisoner's Dilemma game (or its public goods variants) to investigate whether sex affects cooperation. Because Prisoner's Dilemma contains both fear and greed, the theories outlined in this article predict no sex differences in cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemma. A series of hypotheses about the conditions under which sex affects cooperation are proposed and tested against the results of two new studies. Results from both studies support two of the three hypotheses. I conclude by discussing some implications of the findings for collective action and inequality and by suggesting directions for future research.

AB Quantitative longitudinal research neglects theoretical and qualitative work indicating that delinquency is a developmental phase embedded in a chain of emotions leading to cumulative disadvantage in the life course. Building on prior work in the sociological subfields of mental health, delinquency, and the life course, we propose and test a gendered and age-graded sequential stress theory that treats delinquency as a transitional event or set Of events that can play an additive and intervening role in the movement from earlier feelings of anger through rebellious or aggressive (i.e., delinquent) forms of behavior to later depressive symptoms, and, especially, for males, drinking problems. Our results fill in transitional spaces that include a mediating role of delinquency in the cumulation of disadvantage and downward trajectories in gendered pathways to emerging adulthood.

DT Article
ID NATIONAL LEGISLATURES; CONTEXTUAL FACTORS; GENDER INEQUALITY;
   OPPORTUNITY; PARLIAMENT; ATTITUDES
AB Women's low rate of participation at the highest levels of politics is an enduring problem in gender stratification. Previous cross-national research on women in national legislatures has stressed three explanations for differences in women's political representation: social structure, politics, and ideology. Despite strong theory suggesting the importance of ideology, it has not found support in previous cross-national statistical studies. But ideology has not been as well measured as structural and political factors. In this article, we demonstrate that gender ideology strongly affects the number of women in national legislatures. We do so by introducing a newly available measure of national gender ideology into a cross-national model of women in legislatures. We demonstrate that ideology, when measured more precisely, strongly predicts differences in women's political representation.

AB Previous research has shown that fundamentalist religious beliefs and affiliations are associated with conservative gender attitudes. This study expands upon previous research by examining both the individual and contextual effects of conservative Protestantism on gender attitudes. Multilevel analysis of data from the General Social Surveys (1985-96) reveals a significant relationship between the proportion of fundamentalists in a state and conservative gender attitudes of white individuals within that state even after controlling for the individuals' own religious affiliation, beliefs, and practices.

Its sets out a neofunctionalist model of socio-technological innovation that is designed to explore prospectively the impact of innovations in areas such as information and communications technology, on the full range of sociable and nonsociable activities. It uses evidence from a unique data set (a nationally representative time diary panel study, collected in the U.K. for the period 1999-2001) to explore this model. It concludes that Internet use, contrary to "time-displacement" expectations, is not negatively associated with sociability.

We therefore expected that in airwaves auctions for mobile telephony in the U.S., network externalities would show up in firms' bidding. They did, although most firms were penny-wise but pound-foolish.

AB Researchers have documented extreme inequalities in wealth ownership, but the processes that create these inequalities are not well understood. One important contributing factor that attracts little attention is religion. This study explores the relationship between religious participation, religious affiliation, and patterns of wealth accumulation. I argue that religion affects wealth ownership indirectly by shaping demographic behaviors. I also argue that religion directly influences wealth accumulation by identifying valuable goals, by providing a set of competencies that direct strategies of action, and by contributing to social contacts that provide information and opportunities that can enhance wealth ownership. The findings suggest that Jews enjoy tremendous gains in wealth ownership, while conservative Protestants accumulate relatively little wealth. In contrast, mainline Protestants and Catholics are indistinguishable from each other and from the general population. The results demonstrate the importance of family processes in shaping wealth accumulation, and they underscore the importance of culture in shaping economic behavior and ultimately in creating social inequality.

DT Article
ID POLITICAL PROTEST; MICROMOBILIZATION; REVOLUTION; DETERRENCE; COERCION;
   WAR
AB While the social movement literature recognizes the interactive nature Of collective action, models almost uniformly focus on protestors themselves. Consequently, we know a great deal about how social movement organizations recruit participants, mobilize resources, and initiate activity, but have considerably less understanding of how authorities allocate repression in response to (and sometimes in anticipation of) protest events. Here, I use memos from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) counterintelligence program (COINTELPRO) against the New Left between 1968 and 1971 to understand the patterning or repression against protest groups. COINTELPRO is a unique data source; the program was autonomous from other government agencies and was organized solely to covertly "expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize" the activities of FBI targets. The level of tangible threat proxied by New Left groups' size, level of activity, or propensity for violence did not directly structure FBI activity. Instead, these target group characteristics were mediated by organizational processes endogenous to the FBI itself Specifically, central actors in the FBI allocated organizational controls that ensured that visible (i.e., nonlocal) targets were repressed independent of the targets' local activities.

AB The article analyzes variation in the association between education and first occupational class (the "EC association") among Russians from four consecutive labor force entry cohorts spanning 1970-2000 and by sex. Cross-national comparative research suggests that national institutions affect the magnitude of the EC association. However, loglinear models provide no support for the view that the institutional changes associated with the demise of the Soviet system influenced the pattern or magnitude of the EC association in Russia. The only changes in the EC association predated the major institutional changes. The findings confirm research showing continuity in other aspects of stratification in post-Soviet Russia despite rapid institutional changes connected with market transition. Although there are several alternative explanations for the lack of change in the EC association, the null results suggest that the relationship between institutional arrangements and patterns of stratification is not as straightforward as cross-sectional analyses might suggest. Structural forces and policies also shape patterns of stratification, both independently of and in conjunction with institutions.

AB Using time-diary data from a national sample of young school-age children, we examine the correlates of time spent at home on computing for cognitive and other measures of well-being. We observe modest benefits associated with home computing on three tests of cognitive skill, and on a measure of self-esteem. Most young children who spend time at home on computer-based activities spend no less time on activities such as reading, sports or outside play than children without home computers. However, young children who use home computers a lot, for over 8 hours a week, spend much less time on sports and outdoor activities than non-computer-users. They also have substantially heavier body mass index than children who do not use home computers.

   CONSEQUENCES; INVOLVEMENT; EXPERIENCE; ADJUSTMENT; INTENSITY
AB What happens to high school youths when they take on jobs during the school year, sometimes working long hours, while trying to maintain the role of student? There is a consensus in the empirical literature that teenage employment, particularly what is termed "intensive" employment, results in a constellation of detrimental consequences: lower school grades, diminished educational ambitions, and emotional alienation from parents. There is even more consensus that work and intensive work puts youths at great risk of committing delinquent acts and other problem behaviors such as smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, and using marijuana and other drugs. In our view, the conclusion that either work or intensive work has a harmful net effect on youths is based on a thin empirical base. The problem is that previous empirical work has not adequately addressed the issue of possible selection effects. In this article, we reexamine the relationship between intensive employment and delinquency and problem behaviors using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). We conduct two general types of analysis. First, we conduct what we term a traditional analysis wherein we employ observed covariates to capture the selection process. Here we find the same positive relationship between intensive employment and antisocial behavior that others before us have. Second, we conduct both a random and a fixed-effect analysis where we adjust for both observed and unobserved sources of population heterogeneity. In this second analysis, we find that the positive association between work and antisocial behavior observed in the traditional analysis disappears. We discuss the implications of these results both for analyses of the relationship between work and crime in general and for criminological theory.

AB At least 25 separate studies have examined the impact of family structure on offspring marriage timing. Some find that parental divorce makes marriage more likely, while others show that it delays or deters marriage. This research analyzes data from the 1973-94 NORC General Social Survey with the intention of shedding light on the debate. The extraordinarily varying results of prior studies can probably be attributed to change across two dimensions of time, individual life course and historical period. In 1973 parental divorce greatly increased the chances of marriage but by 1994 people from divorced families were slightly less likely to marry than were people from intact families. Furthermore, parental divorce raises the likelihood of teenage marriage, but if the children of divorce remain single past age 20 they are disproportionately likely to avoid wedlock.

   ORGANIZATION; MATURATION; UNDERWORLD; IMPACT; USERS
AB Although early anti more advanced pubertal development has been linked to adolescent girls' delinquency involvement, the social factors that mediate these relationships have not been established. This study incorporates parent and peer relationship measures from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to examine (1) whether parents treat more physically developed daughters differently than their less developed peers, and (2) whether more developed girls are located in friendship networks that are more conducive to delinquency than the networks of less developed girls. Earlier pubertal development and more advanced development are associated with three types of delinquency: "party" deviance, minor delinquency, and serious delinquency. The strength of the association is strongest for "party" deviance (e.g., drinking, smoking, truancy, disorderly conduct). Conflict with parents, trust and autonomy from parents, exposure to peer deviance, and involvement in romantic relationships mediate the puberty-delinquency association. However, the relative importance of each of these mechanisms varies by the context of delinquency and the indicators of pubertal development that are used.

TI Legacies of American slavery: Status attainment among southern blacks

SO SOCIAL FORCES

DT Article
ID OCCUPATIONAL-STATUS; EX-SLAVES
AB This study examines the legacy of American slavery at the individual, intragenerational level by analyzing life-history data from roughly 1,400 ex-slaves and free blacks covering the antebellum and postbellum periods. We test a model of durable inequality that considers the potentially vicious circle created by status persistence across institutional regimes. Our findings suggest that the antebellum regime evidenced partial institutional reproduction in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, owing to the fact that the antebellum distinction of free blacks and slaves had durable status effects long after emancipation, but over time, black status attainment became largely decoupled from the internal hierarchy of slavery. Mediating effects, for example, the Freedmen Bureau's educational interventions and the black diaspora, also served to curtail the reproduction of antebellum status. Implications are pursued with respect to both institutional theory and stratification research.

AB This article extends existing explanations of racial conflict by suggesting how legislation and court rulings instigate processes of legitimation and competitive exclusion, which in turn affect the likelihood of racial violence. We argue that federal legislation and court cases that reinforced the white-nonwhite racial boundary stigmatized nonwhites and prompted whites to attack nonwhites. However, legislation and court rulings that dismantled segregation and eradicated discrimination against racial minorities also instigated racial violence, as whites mobilized efforts to contain competition. A final argument suggests that when legislation successfully restrains competition from a specific population, collective violence against that group will diminish. Using data on collective violence against Asians and African Americans from the 76 largest cities in the U.S. from 1869 through 1924, we find support for these three claims. In particular, we find that while immigration and economic competition raise levels of racial conflict, state policies concerning race also increase the rate of racial violence significantly.

ID INCOME INEQUALITY; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; METROPOLITAN; GROWTH; CURVE
AB This study examines state provisioning of social welfare and employment and its consequences for local economic well-being. Do a larger public sector and more generous social welfare transfers help or harm local populations? To address this question, we derive hypotheses from two competing social policy schools, neoliberal and radical political economy. We assess how claims from both schools operate on the ground, through an empirical test using data for county populations for Keynesian (1970-80) and post-Keynesian (1980-90) decades. Findings do not support neoliberal views that a leaner and meaner government benefits U.S. populations. Rather, economic well-being of the population at large declines where social programs are less generous to poor residents. In both Keynesian and post-Keynesian periods, the state remains Important In reducing income inequality and, to some degree, in promoting income growth. Finally, we find important differences within public employment, with state and local government having less beneficial effects.

AB This study investigates the impact of left political Institutions on a nation's amount of poverty. Specifically, the analysis tests three possible causal relationships: whether left political institutions affect poverty separately from the welfare state, channeled through the welfare state, or combined with the welfare state. These relationships are tested with an unbalanced panel analysis of 16 rich Western democracies from 1967 to 1997 (N = 73, 74), two measures of poverty, and eight measures of left political institutions. The results demonstrate that the strength of left political institutions has a significant, powerful negative impact on poverty. Specifically, left political institutions partially combine with and partially channel through the welfare state. Voter turnout and the cumulative historical power of left parties entirely channel through the welfare state to reduce poverty. The percent of votes for left parties, the percent of seats for left parties, wage coordination, neocorporatism, gross union density and employed union density partially combine with and partially channel through the welfare state to reduce poverty. While the welfare state remains a crucial determinant of poverty, left political institutions are essential to explanations of the comparative historical variation in poverty.

   ACHIEVEMENT; STUDENTS; BEHAVIOR; RACE
AB While research exploring the consequences of desegregation and resegregation for academic achievement and intergroup attitudes and behavior has been prolific, scant attention has been paid to the impact that school segregation differences has had on school violence. Using data from the state of Florida Department of Education and the U.S. Bureau of the Census, we attempt to adjudicate between competing hypotheses about the nature of a relationship between segregation and school violence: (1) that segregation is associated with increased school violence; and (2) that segregation is associated with decreased school violence, especially under conditions of racial inequality. Results from a multilevel analysis show that increased school district segregation has a substantive negative association with school violence, particularly in contexts of greater community inequality, consistent with Pettigrew's (1971) observations about the contact hypothesis. The implications of these findings are discussed.

ID RELIGIOUS PARTICIPATION; POVERTY; BLACKS; MODEL; RACE
AB This study seeks to examine the relationship between church-based social capital resources and political activism among black Americans. Our results suggest that simply attending church does not provide enough social capital resources to propel blacks into voting and nonvoting political activities. Rather, it is largely those churches that espouse a civic culture where members are exposed to political discussions and are encouraged to be activists that lead to black political engagement. In addition, involvement in church committee life is important to black civic skill development (e.g., communication, writing, and organizing skills), which increases these church activists' competence and confidence to participate in costly and risky political acts. This study also sought to investigate the class composition of such politicized church networks. It is largely the case that such networks are stratified by socioeconomic status, such that middle-class blacks disproportionately hear political messages in church and serve as church activists.

AB It is in workers' Interest to leave their jobs if better work can be found, but imperfect information on outside opportunities impedes their job search. We describe two theories on workers' search using the organizational size as a proxy for work characteristics and derive hypotheses on how the organizational size distribution in a labor market affects job separations. We test the hypotheses with NLSY 79 data on job separations, finding that diversity in organizational sizes affects worker mobility. Workers are more likely to move within counties with many organizations larger than their current one or many organizations of different sizes and are more likely to leave counties lacking these characteristics.

AB In this article, we develop hypotheses about the ways in which network ties influence wages and the circumstances under which social capital assumes greater or lesser importance in the determination of migrant earnings. We then test these hypotheses using data on male Mexican migrants gathered by the Mexican Migration Project. We find that social capital has both direct and indirect effects on migrant wages. Indirectly, social capital influences how a job is obtained and whether it is in the formal sector. Directly, having friends and relatives with migratory experience improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the job search to yield higher wages. Moreover, the effects of social capital on wages are greater for undocumented than documented migrants, reflecting the more tenuous labor market position of the former. These results confirm and extend social capital theory and underscore the importance of social networks in understanding the determination of migrant earnings.

TI Fairer sex or fairer system? Gender and corruption revisited
SO SOCIAL FORCES
LA English
DT Article
ID WOMEN; JUDGES; LEGISLATURES
AB Two recent influential studies found that larger representations of women in government reduced corruption. Assuming that the observed gender differentials were caused by women's inclinations toward honesty and the common good, both studies advocated increased female participation in government to combat corruption. This study argues that the observed association between gender and corruption is spurious and mainly caused by its context, liberal democracy - a political system that promotes gender equality and better governance. Data favor this 'fairer system" thesis.

ID SOCIAL-STRUCTURE; DEATH-PENALTY; CRIME; ATTITUDES; BLACK; POPULATIONS;
   DEMOCRACIES; CALIFORNIA; RESOURCES; SOCIOLOGY
AB Despite their plausibility, political explanations for incarceration rates have not been intensely investigated. Centralized democracies that reduce public influence by using corporatist methods to resolve disputes should have lower incarceration rates, but the opposite should be true in decentralized polities with federalist political arrangements where mass publics have greater control over punishment. Threat hypotheses are assessed by examining the effects of minority presence and economic inequality. This study uses a panel design to examine these effects on imprisonment rates in 13 of the most progressive democracies from 1970 to 1995. With the murder or overall crime rates, social disorganization, and additional indicators held constant, the presence of corporatist and federalist political arrangements explain cross-national differences in incarceration rates. The evidence suggests that internal racial or ethnic threat produces larger imprisonment rates as well. The findings indicate that a well-developed comparative political sociology of punishment should help us understand contrasts in the proportion of the population that is incarcerated in advanced democracies.

AB Research into public perceptions of crime seriousness is usually based on the method developed by Sellin and Wolfgang (1964), in which respondents are required to evaluate hypothetical crime scenarios. However, in most cases, offenses are presented summarily, with few or no details on the offenders. A review of the literature shows that the offender's ethnicity plays an important role in shaping the views of the public at large on crime issues. Using a randomized experiment, this study surveyed a large sample of Israeli citizens to determine whether the offender's ethnicity - Jewish or Arab as the independent variable - systematically affected their views of the seriousness of various offenses - the dependent variables. In the overall sample, offender ethnicity was found to have an effect only on less serious offenses. However, when Jewish and Arab respondents were analyzed separately, significant differences were found, especially for interethnic offenses. The implications of the findings are discussed.

   STRATIFICATION; HARASSMENT; FINANCE; MARKET; STATE; GAP
AB Some research has suggested that, once all forms of segregation are controlled, there is no gender gap in earnings. However, other research suggests that substantial barriers to gender equality persist even within occupations. I suggest that institutional norms and market forces that determine compensation practices are likely to produce different results across professions. I hypothesize that gender inequality will persist on Wall Street even when men and women hold identical job titles. Using a cohort sample of securities professionals with highly similar human capital characteristics, I find statistically significant gender differences in 1997 earnings, controlling for background characteristics, human capital, and segregation by area of finance. I offer possible explanations for variation among professions, emphasizing the importance of institutional practices within the securities industry.

ID TRANSITION; ADULTHOOD; YOUTH
AB In this article, we examine the immediate post-high school years of adolescents with disabilities. Using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988 and the National Longitudinal Transition Study of Special Education Students, 1987-1991, we examine the transition from adolescence to adulthood and uncover the specific factors that are associated with the likelihood of making various early transitions to adulthood. Our results reveal that disability and type of disability profoundly affect youths' immediate post-high school activities. In addition, family socioeconomic resources have a smaller impact on the transition to adulthood among adolescents with disabilities than among adolescents without disabilities. Many resources families use to increase education and to promote the transition to adulthood do not operate, effectively blocking the intergenerational transfer of socioeconomic privilege.
