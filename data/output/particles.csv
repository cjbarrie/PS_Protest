TO EXPLAIN THESE ANOMALIES, THIS ARTICLE EMPLOYS THEORIES OF MORAL IDENTITY TO EXPLORE THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF A FACET OF DECISION MAKING THAT RATIONALIST MODELS TYPICALLY REGARD AS FIXED: INDIVIDUALS' AWARENESS OF AND NEED TO EXPRESS VALUES CENTRAL TO THEIR SENSE OF SELF. THREE MECHANISMS DESCRIBE WAYS THAT INDIVIDUALS' RESPONSES TO EARLY RISERS TRIGGER MORAL IDENTITY-BASED MOTIVATIONS FOR PROTEST. FIRST, BY CONJURING NORMATIVE IDEALS, FIRST MOVERS CAN ACTIVATE BYSTANDERS' URGE TO FOLLOW THEIR EXAMPLE IN ORDER TO EARN THEIR OWN SELF-RESPECT. SECONDLY, BY DEMONSTRATING THE JOY OF AGENCY, EARLY RISERS CAN INSPIRE BYSTANDERS' DESIRE TO EXPERIENCE THE SAME GRATIFICATION. THIRDLY, BY ABSORBING PUNISHMENTS, EARLY RISERS CAN ACTIVATE ONLOOKERS' SENSE OF MORAL OBLIGATION TO CONTRIBUTE TO COLLECTIVE EFFORTS. THESE MECHANISMS REDOUBLE BYSTANDERS' SENSE OF THE INHERENT VALUE OF PROTEST, APART FROM ITS INSTRUMENTAL UTILITY, AND INTENSIFY THEIR ACCEPTANCE OF RISKS, INDEPENDENT OF THE ACTUAL RISKS ANTICIPATED. ORIGINAL INTERVIEWS WITH DISPLACED SYRIANS ABOUT THEIR PARTICIPATION IN DEMONSTRATIONS ILLUSTRATE THESE PROCESSES.",877,"NORTHWESTERN UNIV, DEPT POLIT SCI, EVANSTON, IL 60208 USA.;",2020-02-16,PROTEST; CASCADES; SOCIAL MOVEMENTS; IDENTITY; MORALITY; MECHANISMS; SYRIA; ARAB SPRING,10.1017/S0007123416000235,ARTICLE,NA,NA,1469-2112,PEARLMAN@NORTHWESTERN.EDU,901,,PROGRAM ON MIDDLE EAST POLITICAL SCIENCE; NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY; EQUALITY DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBALIZATION STUDIES PROGRAM AT THE BUFFETT INSTITUTE FOR GLOBAL STUDIES; KEYMAN MODERN TURKISH STUDIES PROGRAM AT THE BUFFETT INSTITUTE FOR GLOBAL STUDIES; CROWN FAMILY FUND FOR MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES; ALICE KAPLAN INSTITUTE FOR THE HUMANITIES,"DEPARTMENT OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY (EMAIL: PEARLMAN@NORTHWESTERN.EDU).

I IDENTIFY TWO KINDS OF DISRUPTION: MARKET DISRUPTION AND MEDIATED DISRUPTION. MARKET DISRUPTION DETERS THE ABILITY OF THE CORPORATE TARGET TO EFFECTIVELY ACCRUE AND USE MARKET RESOURCES, WHILE MEDIATED DISRUPTION OCCURS AS A TACTIC COMMUNICATES A MOVEMENT'S CLAIMS ABOUT THE TARGET THROUGH THIRD PARTY INTERMEDIARIES, LIKE THE MEDIA, THEREBY DISRUPTING THE TARGET'S IMAGE AND REPUTATION.

THE ANALYSES INDICATE THAT TARGET CHARACTERISTICS MATTER MORE IN SHAPING A BOYCOTT'S INITIAL MARKET DISRUPTION; HOWEVER, BOTH MOVEMENT AND TARGET CHARACTERISTICS AFFECT MEDIATED DISRUPTION. CERTAIN MOVEMENT CHARACTERISTICS, LIKE SOCIAL MOVEMENT ORGANIZATION (SMO) FORMALITY, PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS, AND CELEBRITY ENDORSEMENTS, ENABLE MEDIATED DISRUPTION BUT HAVE NO EFFECT ON MARKET DISRUPTION. A FIRM'S SIZE MAKES IT VULNERABLE TO BOTH MARKET AND MEDIATED DISRUPTION, WHILE SLACK RESOURCES HELP A FIRM AVOID MARKET DISRUPTION. A TARGET'S REPUTATIONAL RANKING INITIALLY BUFFERS IT FROM MARKET DISRUPTION BUT INCREASES ITS VULNERABILITY TO MEDIATED DISRUPTION. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE TWO KINDS OF DISRUPTION ARE INTERRELATED.

WHY DID THIS REVERSAL IN EASTERN EUROPE HAPPEN DURING A PERIOD OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY, REMARKABLE WESTERN INTEGRATION PROGRESS, AND A BROAD ACCEPTANCE OF ELECTORAL DEMOCRACY AS THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN? THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT THESE ELECTORAL DYNAMICS CAN BE EXPLAINED BY FOCUSING ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN PROTEST VOTING AND ELECTION SEQUENCE. WHILE PROTEST VOTING TO PUNISH UNPOPULAR INCUMBENTS HAS BEEN A WIDESPREAD BUT UNDERSTUDIED PRACTICE SINCE THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM, THE BENEFICIARIES OF THESE PROTEST VOTES HAVE CHANGED IN RECENT ELECTIONS.

IN ANSWERING THESE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS, THIS ARTICLE OFFERS THREE MAIN PROPOSITIONS: THAT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, ISLAMISM CAN EMERGE AS A POWER FILL IDEA THAT GENERATES SOCIAL APPEAL; THAT TO BE SUCCESSFUL, ISLAMIST ORGANIZATIONS MUST DEVELOP A LOCAL ISLAMIST IDEOLOGY THAT SUITS THE LOCAL SOCIAL BASE, RATHER THAN TIC THEMSELVES TO A GLOBAL ISLAMIST AGENDA,; AND THAT IN AUTHORITARIAN CONTEXTS, ESPECIALLY WHERE OPEN MOBILIZATION IS FORBIDDEN, INCLUSIVE INFORMAL SOCIAL NETWORKS ARE AN ESSENTIAL MECHANISM FOR SPREADING ISLAMIST IDEAS AND PROTECTING GROUP MEMBERS. NONETHELESS, THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO AN ISLAMIST MOVEMENT'S ABILITY TO GROW AND BRING ABOUT POLITICAL CHANGE. THE ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF ISLAMISM AND, MORE BROADLY, TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHY AND HOW OPPOSITION MOVEMENTS EMERGE AND MOBILIZE UNDER AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES.
