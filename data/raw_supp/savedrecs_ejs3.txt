ID EVOLUTION; COOPERATION
AB Explanation of the growth of Christianity in the third century Roman Empire has long been controversial. However, recent game-theoretic research shows how a strategy of unconditional altruism such as Christianity formally enjoined can, under certain conditions, resist invasion by defectors, free-riders and cheats. It is accordingly plausible to suggest that in the particular environment of the third century Empire this uniquely distinguishing feature of Christianity accounts for much of its otherwise surprising degree of success.

AB Montesquieu popularized the notion of Oriental Despotism as the type of government pertaining to a lawless society based on the equality of subjects in fear and powerlessness. It typified Europe's Other in the age of absolutism. This essay does not examine the idea of total despotic power directly but rather the assumption of the absence of law and its guarantee of a sphere of civil autonomy and agency which will anachronistically be called "civil society". While substantiating the emergence of a public sphere around coffee-houses, the growth of guilds on the basis of customary law and the development of educational and philanthropic endowments on the basis of the law of waqf we also take the opportunity to compare the civic and educational institutions of the Ottoman and Safavid empires in the 17(th) and early 18(th) centuries.

SO ARCHIVES EUROPEENNES DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
AB How the history of ideas can be modelled by certain unfair interventions is the major purpose of this paper. The case study concerns Charles Fourier (1776-1837) whose writings have been largely ignored by sociology but who holds a relatively significant position in works dealing with the history of socialism or the utopist tradition. For more than a century, Fourier's reception resulted on the one hand from Marx and Engels, who opposed utopist socialism and scientific socialism, and on the other hand from Durkheim, who opposed sociology and socialism.

AB According to sociological tradition, "The City", Robert Park's pioneering work written in 1915, was largely influenced by Georg Simmel "Die Grossstadte und das Geistesleben". At that time, Park was working with W.I. Thomas in the domain of inter-ethnic relations. A careful analysis of these three authors shows that "Race psychology", a paper written by Thomas in 1912, was much more influential for Park than was Simmel.

We then analyse the social norms structuring the mobilisation of family cooperation and activities on the labour black market. Finally, we conclude by underfining the positive effects and disadvantages of these compensations on the experience of unemployment.

One emphasizes the intense solidarity generated by the ethnic bond and explains this in terms of a deep, quasi-kin feeling. The other emphasizes the contingency and situatedness of ethnic feeling and the fluctuating character of ethnic "groupness". We adopt an alternative strategy, locating ethnicity as one factor among many, which may form a path-dependent self-reproductive system generating communal opposition and ethnic conflict.

AB This paper aims to demonstrate that cosmopolitanism should be understood as a transnational mode of practice, whereby actors construct bonds of mutual commitment and reciprocity across borders through public discourse and sociopolitical struggle. This practice-oriented perspective allows us to question three of the main assumptions imbedded within most frameworks theorizing global solidarity, namely cultural homogenization, political fragmentation, and social thinness. To illustrate my argument, I draw upon examples taken from the alternative globalization movement.

Have people who lived for decades under authoritarian conditions been able to develop a democratic culture? Or are their mind-sets and attitudes still influenced by the effects of GDR socialization with its socialist values and ideals? The paper argues that the peculiarities of the political culture in East Germany are less attributable to effects of GDR socialization than to current differences in the economic situation between East and West Germany.

The decline in electoral support for traditional Left parties is attributed to the failure of the European Left to adjust to this realignment.

AB WHEN ACADEMIC SOCIOLOGY was founded around 1900, the idea of creating an economic sociology played an important role in the plans of Durkheim, Weber et al. (I). Durkheim, for example, proposed sociologie economique as one of the key areas of the new science of sociology, and Weber assigned Wirtschaftssoziologie a place of honor in Economy and Society (Durkheim [1909] 1978; Weber [1921-1922] 1978, pp. 63-211). The reason for the idea that a topic such as economic sociology was needed had much to do with the way that economics around this time ignored the role of institutions and social relations. The Battle of the Methods, which went on around this time, also helped to accentuate the analytical dimension of 19(th) century economics and assign its empirical part to the historians. In any case, the development of economic sociology after the founding generation in sociology was very meager, despite some important exceptions by scholars such as Schumpeter, Polanyi and Parsons-Smelser (e.g. Swedberg 2003b, PP. 1-31). It was not until the mid-1980s that economic sociology again caught the imagination of the sociologists, and the so-called "new economic sociology" came into being, primarily as a result of the work of people such as Mark Granovetter, Harrison White and Viviana Zelizer. It was now suggested that all economic actions are "embedded", that markets can be conceptualized as "social structures", and that economic actions do not only have a rational component but also a social-cultural one (e.g. Granovetter 1985; White 1981; Zelizer 1999). These and similar ideas soon led to a flourishing economic sociology, and it is primarily the last decade of its accomplishments to which this article is devoted.

ID BORDERS
AB The transnational turn in international migration research since the early 1990s has sparked vigorous debates among migration scholars. Yet the political aspects of transnational migration have been under-studied when compared to social, cultural and economic processes. This is particularly astonishing because the very term transnational suggests the importance of national borders and nationally-bound polities as opportunities and restrictions of exchange, reciprocity, solidarity and hierarchical control for processes involving non-state actors to varying degrees. The goal of this analysis is to take stock of some developments in the general study of transnationalization and treat the aspects of politics, policy and polity as a specific case of this broader conceptual and empirical effort. This effort also identities questions for further research and offers methodological venues for the study of transnationalism arising out of international migration.

However, this relationship would have been clear for the scholars who dealt with his life and works. The unpublished text that we present will not only enlighten this shadow zone. It also presents the idea of politics cultivated by Mauss as the scientific he was in the last moments of his intellectual life.

   plurality, social movements and rights of local communities to common
   property resources
SO ARCHIVES EUROPEENNES DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper analyses the new architecture of global governance which is characterised by unaccountable international institutions and scattered sovereignties. It examines the dilemmas of civil society actors (social movements and NGOs) involved in protecting the rights of local communities through strategic issue-based alliances with the state or the World Bank, whose legitimacy they question in other contexts. The cunning state remains a central actor in selectively transposing neoliberal policies to the national terrain and capitalises on its perceived weakness in order to render itself unaccountable to its citizens. The argument draws on empirical material from India around conflicts over the patenting of genetic resources, biodiversity conservation, forced displacement and privatisation of common property resources.

TI The 'Civilising Process' in Ghana
SO ARCHIVES EUROPEENNES DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB Norbert Elias went to Ghana as Professor of Sociology for two years. Nevertheless he continued to refer to its inhabitants, despite their rural development, as naturvolk which the civilising process had not touched. That process apparently took off in Europe at the time of the Renaissance and never reached the Third World. The Ghanaians had different kinds of super-ego which did not restrain their behaviour in the same way as Europeans. The lack of restraint is shown in blood sacrifice and in their art, which gives a more direct expression of feeling. Elias' observations were necessarily superficial as he did not carry out fieldwork or learn any languages. He employed them simply to bolster the themes he had developed in a European context rather than using them to modify those themes.

ID MARKET TRANSITION; URBAN CHINA; TRANSFORMATION; REDISTRIBUTION; SYSTEM;
   STATE
AB Disaggregating property rights into abstract bundles of rights over the use, control, and alienation of property facilitates the systematic comparison of property regimes across time and space. However, because these analytic distinctions ignore the criteria by which individuals choose among competing claims of ownership, they cannot capture the moral reasoning that ultimately institutionalizes a property regime. Using focus group debates over competing claims of ownership to newly privatized urban real estate, this essay identifies four grounded logics of entitlement by which Shanghai residents determine just claims in one post-socialist property regime: a logic of family justice, a logic of state regulation, a logic of the market, and a logic of the family estate. Of note is that the primary criteria by which individuals decided among different logics of entitlement were the rules of the property regime at the time the dwelling first became the family home rather than differences attributable to societal inequalities tied to distinctions of gender, generation or occupation.

AB Being an 'antiglobahzationist' comes easy as a political label but as a theoretical endeavor, it is more difficult. Globalization encompasses a bundle of meanings. The paper disentangles some of the multiple implications of globalization and its purported enemies through the Big Mac-Roquefort opposition; it examines the taste differential of the two products, their symbolism and their stakes in the construction of ethnic, cultural and class identities. The simplistic opposition between globalization and its enemies is reinterpreted in the context of commercialization, Americanization, democratization, high-and mass-culture and-consumption, only to be cast in the age-old tensions of modernity.

TI Changing families as European societies age

ID PREMARITAL COHABITATION; MARITAL DISRUPTION; MATTER
AB The trends towards falling fertility and mortality and increasing longevity, which have led to the demographic ageing of all Western industrialized societies, have not occurred in isolation. More specifically, we are also seeing a combination of forces which are resulting in the ageing of some life transitions. While public and legal institutions may be lowering the age threshold into fall legal adulthood , individuals themselves are choosing to delay many of those transitions which demonstrate a commitment to full adulthood. This shift from a high-mortality/ high-fertility society to a low-mortality/low-fertility society and the ageing of family transitions within these societies have significant implications for both family structure and kinship roles. Drawing on recent demo-graphic figures for the European Union, this paper highlights the impact of these main trends on individuals and families.

TI Social capital and its uses
SO ARCHIVES EUROPEENNES DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
AB The article attempts to assess the use and usefulness of the concept of 'social capital'. First, it assesses its differing conceptual uses in the works of four key writers, Pierre Bourdieu, Gary S. Becker, James S. Coleman and Robert D. Putnam, identifying broadly a problematic 'social capital as social fact' perspective associated with Putnam, and a more promising 'contacts with influential people' approach that can be derived from Bourdieu. It then considers the practical uses already made of the former approach in the development studies literature, before addressing sone of the analytical problems associated with applying the latter in a policy enviroment. Finally, it takes three short examples from research in rural Central and Eastern Europe to illustrate how the concept can be used to both analyse social relations and suggest policy priorities. The article's conclusion is that 'social capital' of the bourdieu-derived kind can be useful, work-a-day concept in social analysis.

AB This article of fiscal sociology suggests an analytical review of the corpus of models and data relative to the avoidance (legal or not) of the tax so as to establish a cognitive theory of the rationality of the taxpayer. It aspires also to catch the attention of the sociologists for this promising field of research, through still neglected. On the basis of labelling theory of the deviance, of the tax revolt history and fiscal (social) psychology, the rational approach of the taxpayers insists on the importance of the concrete cognitive relation towards tax to explain the phenomena of tax avoidance (or not). It consists both in underlining the limits of the self-interest standard model and in emphasizing the political dimension of the taxation to give credence to the reality of a citizen's conception about the fair taxation ('contribudon-tax') of the fiscal State in a given context.

TI Religious ethics, gift exchange and capitalism
SO ARCHIVES EUROPEENNES DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB This study intends to reread Max Weber's Protestant Ethic with the following question in mind: where is the Catholic ethic with respect to "the spirit of capitalism"? The few short comments that Weber makes on this topic nevertheless suggest an interesting notion which he had developed in earlier texts, i.e., the "religious ethic of brotherhood". I intend to show here that this notion could be further illuminated by the findings of the anthropology of gift giving since Marcel Mauss. This would enable us to understand how the problem of grace, so central to the debate between Protestants and Catholics, is linked to the history of the transformations in the gift giving practices; we will also discover that this problem was at the origin of the schism. While such a hypothesis leads to a different reading of Weber, it is confirmed by a work of the historian B. Clavero which brings out the complex links that existed in 16(th) century Catholic Spain between the order of business and that of charity. Besides the antagonism that has marked the two Christian traditions in the West, what seems to be at issue is the way in which economic practices weight on the social bond. These questions invite us to rethink the connections between them.

TI Spectral secularism religion, politics and democracy in India
SO ARCHIVES EUROPEENNES DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
ID HISTORY
AB Everyone invokes secularism in India. So the spectrum of secularism is very large. However, it is rather the spectral ideas of "majority" (hindus) and "minoritics" (Muslims, Christians) conceived in demographic (rather than political) terms which characterizes the discussion of this question. The insistence of Hindu nationalists on emphasizing that they are the majority tend to blur the difference between Hindu identity and Indian identity, coextensive with the territory of India. This concept, moreover, serves them in their legitimating of the democratic system insofar as the arithmetical rule is a first principle of this political regime. In the name of a secularism founded on the idea of the greater number (and also the supposed ideal of immemorial Hindu tolerance) India must be governed in accordance with demographic fact defined in religious terms. One of the paradoxical consequence of this "majoritarianism" is the development of "majority minority complex" of the Hindus and the increasing hate and violence (against Muslims and Christians). Today, the Hindu nationalism programme effectively dominates public debate. Its partisans has succeeded in discriminating between "friends" and "foes", those inside and those outside, those whom one holds dear and those whom one pillories on the basis of a real or imaginary menace weighing upon autochthony, culture, religion and race, and the national (state) sovereignty.

Those different regimes can complement one another, enhancing the democratic accountability of the system overall. They can also undercut one another, if their differences are not respected. Bringing the Third Sector under a market-style accountability regime, through "public-private partnerships" based on competitive tendering, undermines the distinctive contribution that the Third Sector might make.

ID CITIES; STATE
AB This paper asks whether it is possible to study "elite" professional migrants in Europe with the same concepts and theories being used to explain the incorporation and/or integration of "ethnic" (i.e., non European) migrants in Europe; that is, in terms of their social mobility and social power in their new host countries. While globalisation may in theory make it easier for these professional migrants to transfer their "social capital" to other national contexts, observations of the personal and professional trajectories of European professional migrants in Brussels-particularly their difficulties establishing a true social power in a foreign national suggests that theorists often overstate their arguments about "global cities" and the decline of the nation-state, at least as far as Europe is concerned. The paper links these empirical concerns with theoretical issues arising from the work of Bourdieu, Mann, Coleman, Castells and Portes, aiming to build a bridge between current work in ethnic and migration studies and core current issues in social theory.

TI Citizenship between De- and Re-ethnicization
SO ARCHIVES EUROPEENNES DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB This article discusses some contemporary transformations of citizenship across Western states, with a special emphasis on Europe. It is argued that citizenship is subject to counter-vailing "de-" and "re-ethnicization" pressures, the first pushing toward incorporating immigrants, the second toward retaining des with emigrants abroad. While grounded in the dual nature of the modern state as a territorial and ethnic unit, and reinforced by contemporary globalizing and transnationalizing processes, de- and re-ethnicization are identifiable projects of the political left and right, respectively. Which trend prevails is then a simple function of who has the political majority.

TI Transitional justice in the French restorations
SO ARCHIVES EUROPEENNES DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB The study of transitional justice-trials, purges and reparations after regime transitions-is emerging as a vital field of scholarship. Virtually all writings on the topic, however, are limited in two ways. First, they tend to focus on the twentieth century. Second, they usually limit themselves to transitions to democracy. In this article I transcend these limitations by considering transitional justice in the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy with an analytical framework for the study of transitional justice. I discuss the 1814 and 1815 restorations, with main emphasis on the political constraints on transitional justice that followed from the fact that these were negotiated transitions. I consider public and private retribution, before turning to the issues of restitution and compensation.

TI A new look at 'National Identity'
SO ARCHIVES EUROPEENNES DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
ID GERMANY; CITIZENSHIP; CHARACTER; FRANCE; STATE
AB 'COLLECTIVE IDENTITY' and 'national identity' have become widely used and heavily contested concepts, both in various social sciences and in general public discourse (Brubaker, Cooper 2000). Many general criticisms of the term 'collective identity' refer to its connotations of wholeness, unity, homogeneity, and continuity or permanence (Niethammer 2000). These criticisms can be avoided, however, if we use a more inclusive empirical conception of collective and national identity. Many affirmative understandings of collective identity, on the other hand, draw too close a parallel with certain conceptions of individual identity, and fill the term collective identity with problematic normative or evaluative content. Identity is then used as a 'success' term (it is good if you have it, bad if you don't). For the sake of analytical clarity, however, it seems useful to understand the term in a more open and analytical way and to keep normative evaluations separately.
   This is equally true for certain uses of 'national identity'. There is a notorious typology of 'conceptions of nationhood', which opposes 'ethnocultural' conceptions to political or 'civic' conceptions of nationhood. This typology carries a heavy normative load, favoring civic identities over the others. It is also used for explanatory purposes. Analytically, however, the typology is unsatisfactory, as are the normative and explanatory applications. A more multidimensional analysis of elements of national identity would be useful, clarifying some, possible meanings of 'ethnic', 'cultural' and 'political' in this context. More recently, there-have also been some criticisms of the typology and its normative connotations (Yack 1996; Brown 1999; Nielsen 1996-97). I want to take these criticisms somewhat further and give them a stronger conceptual foundation.

ID ISLAM
AB WASAHINGTON policy makers acknowledged a new sense of public in the Muslim-majority and Arab worlds even before the September II, 2001 terrorist attacks. For them, it is called the 'Arab street',
   a new phenomenon Of public accountability, which we have seldom had to factor into our projections of Arab behavior in the past. The information revolution, and particularly the daily dose of uncensored television coming out of local TV stations like al-Jazira and international coverage by CNN and others, is shaping public opinion, which, in turn, is pushing Arab governments to respond. We don't know, and the leaders themselves don't know, how that pressure will impact on Arab policy in the future (Walker 2001; see also Tenet 2001).
   The use of the term 'street', rather than 'public sphere' or 'public', imputes passivity or a propensity to easy manipulation and implies a lack of formal or informal leadership. Nonetheless, this use of 'street' shows how policy makers now acknowledge that authoritarian and single-party states also have 'publics' that they must take into account.

TI Rationality and identity: A critique of Alessandro Pizzorno
SO ARCHIVES EUROPEENNES DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB THE QUESTION of personal identity is both complex and highly important. Universally famous literary characters-Tartuffe and Quixote, Faust and Mr Hyde, Robinson and Torquemada-exhibit or suffer from problems of personal identity that writers have happily exploited for creative purposes. In numerous works of literature, the hero-or antihero-either displays all the signs of a split personality or evolves into another person. Identity, of course, is not just a favourite theme in literature, but also has been, and still is, an important object of philosophical and scientific enquiry and analysis, attracting the attention of philosophers of the mind and cognitive psychologists, as well as neuro-physiologists and even experts in artificial intelligence. At the same time, even if largely in isolation from the latest developments in these fields, contemporary moral and political philosophers have also been drawn to this question. From the communitarian, and later republican, critique, to liberalism, the question of the self and its identity has been considered a crucial element of the current debates on 'identity politics', and one, moreover, with decisive moral and political consequences. Equally, the question of individual and social identity has long attracted the attention of social scientists. Indeed, with the end of the old certainties regarding the importance of social structures, and the centrality traditionally assigned to class, attention has now shifted to all sorts of competing sources of identity, from nation to race, from gender to sexual preferences, and from religion to club. All these sources of identity make up a rich kaleidoscope of phobias and loyalties, which help tell individuals who they are in an increasingly polymorphic and decentralised social world; one which is increasingly less organised around traditional categories such as work, profession or class. Interest in this whole area is such that there are now numerous 'Identitary' theories of human behaviour that are presented as alternatives-it was only a matter of time before they emerged-to rational choice theory, the dominant paradigm in the social sciences over the last two decades. One such alternative to rational choice theory, and undoubtedly one of the most influential in Europe at least, is that elaborated by the Italian sociologist Alessandro Pizzorno. Yet despite Pizzorno's influence, we consider that his treatment of the crucial question of identity is far from convincing. In this article we merely seek to justify this assertion.
   In order to do so, we first outline Pizzorno's critique of rational choice theory and his conception of identity as a string of selves. In the second part of the text we offer a detailed analysis and critique of the Italian sociologist's theoretical position. Finally, we focus on, and try to clarify, some of the key methodological aspects of rational choice theory, which in our opinion Pizzorno misinterprets.

TI Rehabilitating the politician on a neglected genre in political
   theorizing
SO ARCHIVES EUROPEENNES DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB TO A CONSIDERABLE extent, politics is what politicians do and say, wrote J.D.B. Miller in an inaugural lecture at Leicester University in 1958, recommending the study of politicians political scientists (Miller 1958, 16). Here, I move on the level of the second order discussion and study what has been said about politicians within the perspective of conceptual history. The apologies of politicians form a genre of literature-perhaps a parody of both the Fiirstenspiegel and the 'statesman'-biographies-that is unduly neglected by political theorists and intellectual historians.
   I have two objectives in this article: to historically identify the genre and to use some examples in order to analyze the strategies of rhetorical redescription (in the sense of Quentin Skinner 1996, 1999) as styles of the apologies of politicians.
   My thesis is that the genre of the apologies of the ideal type of politician has only arisen as a response to the massive body of literature against the professional politicians of the late 19th century Whereas the lamentations of politicians are legion, there are not very many more systematic examples of the defences of politicians. As a response to this derogatory literature, the apologies of the politician also provide LIS with one of the best sources for studying the activity-concept of politics. Max Weber's Politik als Beruf (1919) in a sense both originates and transcends the genre.

AB After World War 11, Israel and Germany adopted curiously similar policies of ethnic immigration, accepting as immigrants only putative co-ethnics. The objective of this article is to account for the main variation between the two cases, the resilience of Jewish immigration in Israel, and the demise of ethnic-German immigration in Get many. The very fact of divergent outcomes casts doubt on conventional accounts of ethnic immigration, which see the latter as deriving from an ethnic (as against civic) definition of nationhood. We point instead to the possibility of 'liberal' and 'restrictive' contention surrounding ethnic immigration, and argue that for historical and geopolitical reasons the political space for such contention has been more constricted in Israel than in Germany.

Perhaps in Weber's last years, religion and mysticism moved from being merely intellectual interests to something more significant and personal.

TI Is friendship a sociological topic?
SO ARCHIVES EUROPEENNES DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
AB Sociologists have shown little interest in friendship. The rather fragmentary empirical work which does exist on friendship in modern society paradoxically tends to confirm the impression that the subject is of marginal importance; for friendship emerges from much research as a relationship which provides emotional support and small services but little else. Admittedly, there is also evidence indicating links with more classical sociological themes-such as access to jobs. But this evidence is often seen as representing 'exceptional' circumstances. Thus, among an immigrant group, friendship des may be seen as particular to the culture from which immigrants come; among an elite group, the importance of friendship ties may be seen as peculiar to that elite circle. We can talk of a genuine 'paradigm' of modern society as being based on relatively impersonal relations. The paper maintains that if friendship is approached differently, it emerges as of more central and 'structural' interest. What is required is a shift on bboth theoretical and methodological levels. Sociology needs to shift its theoretical perspective and recognize that people articulate their values, enact their strategies, develop their language in facc-to-face groups, not as isolated individuals. In terms of empirical research, what is needed are methods capable of tracing these groupings. This is difficult at present because most sociological methods rely heavily on data collected on individuals and their attributes.

TI Towards a more significant sociology of friendship
SO ARCHIVES EUROPEENNES DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB Eve's polemic on the relatively insignificant contribution of sociological studies of friendship to the central concerns of the discipline has some force. However, he weakens his case in three main ways. Firstly, his over-reliance on Giddens to demonstrate the contrast in the importance of personalistic relations between 'traditional' and 'late-modern' societies. See for example Allan Silver. Secondly, Eve's contention that there is an over-reliance on dyadic relationships in the study of friendship is becoming outdated, as demonstrated in the major ESRC project 'Rethinking Friendship'. Thirdly, Eve underestimates the importance of analyses of friendship in contemporary sociological studies of stratification and power. For example, the so-called velvet revolution of 1989 in Eastern Europe were fuelled by the friend-based organisation of radically dissident intellectuals.

AB The influence of Marcel Mauss' study The Gift has largely been confined to the study of the circulation of goods and the social relations in which their transfer is embedded. One of Mauss' principal aims, however, was to show the political importance of gift-giving in averting the recourse to violence. In this paper, his approach to the offering, receiving and reciprocating of gifts is used to analyse the phenomenon of Pentiniento - the exchange of confessions for reduced sentences by terrorists and mafiosi which has become a central feature of the effort to combat organised violence in Italy since 1980.

Existing analyses highlight the irrationality of drivers, victims of an 'illusion of control', a 'bias of optimism' or influenced by social and cultural factors. Using qualitative and quantitative information this article suggests a new perspective, in which driving is regarded as a 'social activity' (in the Weberian sense) and it is presumed that drivers operate on a cognitive rationality.

AB This article discusses the theory and practice of multicultural citizenship in liberal states. Regarding theory, I point to the shortcomings of both 'radical' and 'liberal' approaches to justify minority rights. Regarding practice, the state-centered notion of multicultural citizenship deflects from the decentered accommodation of multicultural minority claims in functionnally differentiated societies. It also runs counter to a trend toward de-ethnicization in liberal states, in which the cultural impositions of the majority on minority groups are growing thin, thus removing the case for minority rights.

TI Civil society and Islam: A sociological perspective
SO ARCHIVES EUROPEENNES DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
AB Recent political developments in Iran, Turkey, Egypt and Algeria, among others, suggest the possible emergence of an indigenous Islamic path of democratic formation. However, the conventional western interpretations, of religion, and in particular of Islam, leave little room for the recognition of the actual, complex development of such Islamic countries. Defining Islam and modernity as two more or less incompatible phenomena fails to recognize the potentialities of developing modern democratic Islamic societies with their cultural elements and particularities. Many Muslim countries themselves fail to see or are unwilling to recognize their own civil societies and them dynamic potentialities and to accept, in Locke's term, 'the sovereignty of civil society'. Although the notion of a traditional civil society in the Islamic countries is controversial, I contend that neither individualism nor democratic institutions have been or are necessary for a civil society to exist. The basis of a civil society is the existence of influential civil groups and their institutions that can, through established mechanisms counterbalance state power. Analyzing civil society in Muslim countries requires that we recognize Islam not only as a religion, but also as a political theory and the major source of a legitimization of political power.

TI Explaining nationalism - The contradictions of Ernest Gellner
SO ARCHIVES EUROPEENNES DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB Ernest Gellner's theory of nationalism is founded on a simplistic and deceptive materialistic reasoning, masking the tension between functionalist postulates and historicist inclinations. Various methods are used to resolve this tension. Initially, idealism is introduced into the body of the analysis. When this becomes too visible, the nature of the materialism displayed is discretely modified. Relational materialism - a dynamic articulation between relations to the means of production and relations between classes - gives way to substantialist materialism - based on a mechanical opposition between the means of production and ethno-linguistic attributes. The use of a consistent vocabulary obscures the elision between the two: 'structure' and 'culture' are alternatively defined in relational or in substantialist terms. Gellner then returns to relational considerations which make his explanation all the more unclear.

AB This article examines the debate on the developmental impact of foreign direct investment (FDI). While the most frequent finding within sociology is that FDI is harmful or at least less beneficial than domestic investment, most who study the transition from socialism or make economic policy in the region consider FDI to be a major motor of development. This paper examines the impact of FDI with a novel methodology Rather than employing the standard analytic strategy that uses state-level macroeconomic data in a cross-national comparison, this article directly compares the performance of foreign owned firms to domestically owned firms. In the analysis six hypotheses derived from this debate on the role of FDI are tested with logistic regression on two large random sample surveys of Hungarian firms The findings support the position that foreign direct investment is beneficial for the recipient country. In addition, they support the idea that foreign owned firms are more beneficial than domestically owned firms.

AB Empirical life course research is based on prospective or retrospective longitudinal micro data and nationally representative samples of birth cohorts or larger populations. This field of research has developed since the 1970s as one of the major social science instruments of studying the dynamics of both individual lives and societies. The paper reviews critically the contributions of life course studies by comparing the initial expectations with practices and results during the last twenty years.

TI Middle range realism
SO ARCHIVES EUROPEENNES DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper proposes a liaison -'middle-range realism'-between two long standing explanatory strategies in sociology-'middle-range theory' and 'realist social theory'. Each offers what the other lacks. Middle-range theory carries an acute sense of the function of theory within empirical inquiry but has left undeveloped any notion of its appropriate explanatory form. Realist social theory has propositional precision but has been unable, in the most part, to descend from a critical domain to the empirical plane Middle-range realism thus offers a research strategy of the appropriate form and scope to lead and to federate empirical inquiry. Examples are provided of how middle-range realism can be applied to improve research using two different strategies (survey methods and evaluation research) in two contrasting substantive areas (voting behaviour and offender rehabilitation).

TI Beruf, rationality and emotion in Max Weber's sociology
SO ARCHIVES EUROPEENNES DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
ID JAMES,WILLIAM
AB The concept of Beruf variously translated as 'calling' or 'vocation', refers to the practice of systematic self-control in pursuing constant goals or purposes, which Weber, in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905). found in both Calvinist religious practice and capitalistic entrepreneurship and labour. But the term is not confined to these applications; it is also central in Science ar a Vocation (1917) and Politics as a Vocation (1919). The general significance of the idea of Beruf is that it accounts for the mechanisms required to realize in action the quality of rationality, another of Weber's characteristic terms. The connection between rational activity and calling is constant in Weber's discussion. In his early statement of the argument however, practices of Beruf achieve rationality through the suppression of emotion. In his later discussion, Beruf is achieved through and expresses passion and emotions.
