TI Shifting to all-volunteer armed forces: context, reasons, functional and
   socio-political impact
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
ID GENDER INTEGRATION; MILITARY
AB The rise of volunteer armed forces is not a novel trend : it started long ago, and gathered strength gradually as a consequence of the slow decline of conscript-based mass armies. The demise of the East-West standoff has radicalised it. All-volunteer forces are now becoming the norm in Europe. The factors behind such a major shift, both functional and socio-political, seem compelling. Yet, they are not decisive per se : the outcome is not predetermined (a handful of countries are resisting the trend), and usually results from voluntarist moves by one or a few political actors. When the decision has been made, the transition is generally successful, and is for that reason cut short. Structural and institutional changes follow in short order, which rapidly move military establishments away from their << total institution >> format of old. Under favoutable circumstances, social and cultural marginalization is averted. However, despite an excellent public image today, the risk of growing societal indifference is ever present, and shortfalls in recruitment and retention at rank and file level are a distinct possibility. The influence of the new all-volunteer organizational format on European military identities is generally in the direction of << pragmatic professionalism >>, which strongly contrasts with cases elsewhere (notably in the United States) where other factors induce an uncooperative, << radical professional >> culture that is apt to generate political tensions. While the post-Cold War era has ushered in a new balance of civil-military relations at the political-military interface, all-professional armed forces are no longer viewed with the kind of alarm that long prevailed during the 20(th) century. Finally, the rise of the new dominant organizational format is fraught with unanticipated consequences : it severely limits the military options of ruling politicians, and enhances trends towards internationalisation of security.

TI The officer in French society: a heritage of the Third Republic
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB Nationalism which reached its peak in France in the Third Republic, made the army sacred because of a << mystical link >> with the nation. Introduced at the same period, the military service, by passing the whole of the male population through army ranks, gave rise to the theory of the officer's << social role >>. Thus the officer was at the centre of society, yet obliged by republican legality to respect strict political neutrality. However, in case of a failing, whether real or supposed, of civil power, he became, for a part of French citizens, the representative of virtual legitimacy. This was the situtation in 1940 and during the Algerian war. The mystical link and the social role were both put forward to authorize the military to speak on behalf of the nation. This army-society relationship became obsolete due to the transformations in society and disappeared altogether when compulsory enlistment was abandoned.

TI Why do young people enlist in the armed forces today?
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB Why does one become a soldier of the ranks at the age of twenty ? According to determinist theories, the professional guidance of young people depends essentially on the policies of firms and the practices of institutions. The constructivist theories, however, believe that professional appointment is based on a process of finding a match between self representation and job representation. By trying to define what makes a young person show an interest in employment in the military ranks offers an ideal means to test the latter of these two theories. In fact, the army has numerous faces which are made known to the public through advertizing. It would therefore be possible to evaluate the weight of these representations in the eventual interest shown for a particular military career. If these representations play a part in the choice of professional activity, then the hypothesis can be made that young people who show an interest in subordinate military jobs move in preference towards one type of military career in particular. This is precisely what was observed following a study on young people's enquiries in army recruitment centres.

DT Article
ID MILITARY; SUPPORT; FORCES
AB Women have played an increasingly important role in the western military establishment and this process has continued during the post-Cold War era even while the size of the armed services has been reduced significantly. The role of women in the military illustrates how the state in contemporary liberal democracies has to respond to, on the one hand, the functional, strategic imperative of building military organizations that are << fit to fight >> and, on the other, the societal imperative of conforming to wider civilian values such as social equality. While some analysts follow Huntington in conceptualising the relationship between these imperatives in a zero-sum fashion, this paper uses a pragmatic perspective, deriving from the work of Janowitz, which emphasises that the degree to which there will be a tension between these imperatives is very much an empirical question. It focuses on the British army and analyses the ways in which the nature of contemporary warfare, military technology and socio-legal change are transforming the ways in which women participate in military life. The paper discusses the extent to which parts of the military are likely to remain a << male preserve >> even if current formal restrictions on the employment of women were to be abandoned.

TI Explaining the construction of professionalism in the military: history,

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper is an exploration of the ways in which the idea of professionalism has been analysed in the sociology of professional groups and its application in the development and transformation of the armed forces. It begins by reviewing the development of concepts and theories within the sociology of professional groups and the relevance of these different interpretations and explanations to the military. It will argue that the earlier structural models of professions, as institutions with special characteristics and normative values, were not of interest to researchers of the military. Similarly the subsequent characterization of professionalism as an occupational project of market closure and occupational enhancement has never been of relevance to the military since the armed forces have always been a relatively closed sector of the occupational labour market. The latest interpretation, of professionalism as a discourse, is of much more interest and relevance to the military, however. It will be demonstrated that the military provides a clear example of the use of the discourse of professionalism as a mechanism of occupational change, and in particular its power as a form of self-discipline or control << at a distance >>.

TI The << military society >>. Its future seen through professionalization
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB After clarifying what should be meant by << military society >>, one is reminded that human and social sciences have for along time shown interest in warfare and armies by giving priority to three viewpoints : historical, functionalist and socio-legal. But these are debatable even outmoded points that should be set aside to make room for another model which is termed here as a cultural one. Then, the conditions in which this entity appeared are recalled and they refer to a precise socio-cultural context : the one deriving from the birth of the nation-State in nineteenth century Europe. However, in order to be able to speak about a society, it is therefore necessary to fulfil several conditions, these are detailed in a second part where the specific features of a military group are given in more details. Once this done, the point at issue is to know whether the main characteristics which used to make of the armies a society are still valid. An attentive examination of changes that inter-state and indeed within a state confrontations have experienced in the post-Cold War era and these coinciding with army professionalization that many western countries have started, compel us to doubt somewhat the preservation of the present military society. In other words, we can bet on a relative withdrawing of the socio-cultural specificity of the military world within the global society.

DT Article
AB In reply to the need for information requested by armies in view of the reform which they are currently undergoing, the Centre d'etudes en sciences sociales de la defense (Centre for social sciences studies in the field of defence) has made an original contribution to the knowledge of armies and the professional soldier in France, based on three key axes in this field of discipline, all interlinked. Thus, the analysis of the position of women, present in the armies, in terms of their appointment or views on their activity, brings to light certain difficulties encountered by the military institution regarding their integration. The assignments entrusted to the armies, both inside and outside national territory, make it possible to determine the current characteristics of the military profession, in connection to their operational reality, wondering whether they modify more or less deeply their nature. Finally, the study of the relations between the armies and society shows that if the assignments mentioned earlier leave some military perplexed, they are seen more positively by the population, which leads to a redefining, at least partial, of the social utility of the armies.

AB This article proposes some remarks on ethnical segregation in secondary schools based on the analysis of the distribution of over 144.000 students in 333 secondary schools in the Bordeaux Academy. First, the author suggested forming an indicator in order to define the ethnical variable related to the students first names, and thus distinguish the "autochtones" from the "allochtones". Then, he observed the distribution of the students, particularly in relation to this ethnical variable, in all the secondary schools of the Academy to show that there is a high level of dispersion and that very few schools concentrate large numbers of allochtonous students. Finally, the author examines the educational consequences of ethnical segregation in terms of school results and choice of course at the end of 4(th) year secondary school (15-16 year-olds).

TI The << loss of interest >> in scientific studies. Paradox of the French
   situation
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
ID DEMOCRATIZATION; EDUCATION
AB The loss of interest of school-goers in scientific studies is a common phenomenon in numerous industrialized countries. This phenomenon is too easily blamed on the image young generations supposedly have of science. In reality, regarding the situation in France, there are solid grounds to believe that this is more likely caused by social demographical factors. A paradox which clearly indicates that the choice of studies is not linked solely to the course I subject content : it was exactly at the time when in secondary education a physics-chemistry specialization was introduced, that the registrations in scientific subjects in further education started, to drop sharply. The explanation put forward here, is related to the hierarchy of subjects. For a large number of students, the choice of physics-chemistry studies rather than mathematics is associated with a lower level of educational ambition, which itself is associated with a lower level of success and/or a more modest social background. This observation may be generalized. One of the causes for this loss of interest in scientific studies, in France, is the fact that scientific courses at the lycee (upper secondary) are becoming less and less distinctive. Over the last fifteen years, especially since 1995, women, average students academically-speaking, and students with a modest social background, have been more and more numerous to follow scientific baccalaureat courses. Yet women, academically average students and students with a modest social background, fully worthy in all aspects, are less inclined to opt for long term scientific studies.

AB The study of a conflict centered on whether to keep primary schools in the ZEP programme, gives some clear figures illustrating the more general nature of commitment and mobilization on school matters. Mobilization, which was analyzed from retrospective accounts of its various protagonists, shows how it is possible for local movements to take part in non-specific claims, without however forgetting the initial reasons for dissatisfaction. This means of access with a justified cause reaching beyond the mediatization of the movement, has given it an inner strength. In fact, these types of action, coming from a local base, have brought into light questions of general interest that are presented and discussed. However, the closing of debate shows that although administration meets the parents' initial claim with satisfaction, it refuses to recognize its legitimacy.

AB Based on the observation according to which the School of Chicago had failed to study this massive phenomenon, namely the diffusion of the automobile, unlike other aspects which are characteristic of American urbanization in the first half of the 20(th) century, this text attempts to understand the intellectual and social logic which resulted in its members marginalizing the automobile impact to such an extent that no echo was given to a dissertation defended on this subject in 1928 by one of the school's students. The task at hand is to show that the configuration in which motorization was made a subject of research was not limited to the sociological field only, but included a certain number of other fields of expertise which differentiated themselves precisely by the intensity of their investment in the subject, while being included in a game of mutual intellectual and social relations. It! this way we extricated the social conditions of a production of identified and certified knowledge on the automobile phenomenon in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s, taken from detailed analysis of researchers practice, and more particularly, we identified the different methods used for characterized research.

ID STRATEGY
AB The expression "ideal type" is part of the vocabulary currently used in sociology. These terms are however highly ambiguous. The recurring debates on this issue have not only had an impact on the signification and the methodological consequence of the notion, but also on its origin. The latter is most often situated within German intellectual tradition but it also appears in Durkheimian-inspired sociology. The ideal type is linked sometimes to a conceptualizing process belonging to social sciences, sometimes, to the will for a selective reduction of complexity, and sometimes, to a particular method. In fact, the ideal type is a model. In practice, however, when carrying out field research, the distinction between ideal type and average type often becomes blurred. Yet, if the ideal type was brought back to mean synthesis of observation facts, it would be the raison d'etre of the concept which would fall under compromise.

TI Skills as cultural capital?
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB In this paper we refer to Bourdieu's distinction of economic, cultural and social capital, suggesting to extend the concept of cultural capital by includind as an additional dimension the manual skills persons have. We further explore how skills (as a part of cultural capital) are related to economic and social capital. Based on face-to-face-interviews of a sample of residents of four poverty areas in Cologne, Germany, we empirically test the proposition, skills can be converted into economic and social capital. Our findings indicate that persons receiving transfer payments convert their skills into economic capital significantly more often than persons without transfer payments. The conversion of skills depends upon the size of the social network, hence on the social capital the person has. The findings support the theoretical argument to include skills in the concept of cultural capital.

AB This article presents the structure of the Foundations of Social Theory and examines the bases of the (( new social science)) that allow for rational social intervention in the new social structure characterized by the existence of many corporate actors. The particularity of Coleman's theory of action is that it goes no further than instrumental rationality, whereas one of the major difficulties presented by the new social structure is that the social capital provided by primordial relations is weaker than it used to be.

DT Article
AB The purpose of this article is to analyze some contributions, but above all the limitations, of rational choice theory with regard to the problem of connections between micro and macro. Coleman's criticisms of Weber's theory in The Protestant Ethic are examined; his misinterpretations of Weber, and the metatheoretical bases for them, arc brought to light. It is shown that Weber's theory not only identifies the mechanisms for moving from micro to macro, but that it accounts more effectively for macrophenomena such as capitalism than does the theory of expected utility, and is more useful for understanding the emergence not of a single norm (which rational choice theory itself explains) but a constellation of integrated norms. It then shows how instrumental rationality theory does no more than extend the contributions of traditional sociological approaches to norm emergence, such as Hobbes', and recalls certain problems to which instrumental rationality theory has not provided satisfactory responses.

AB Coleman's project is to resocialize rational choice while keeping micro-macro connections as operational as they are in economics. The general model of the Foundations either accounts for norms while effacing social organization, or highlights social organization (in the reduced form of social capital distribution) white failing to engender sufficient norms. A later simulation model suggests that the problem is intrinsic to calculative rationality : only with interpretive rationality can collective objects be taken into account. This shift would require the rational actor to speak in less cursory terms, to use intensional rather than extensional language.

AB James Coleman's work on social norms is both insightful and dogmatic. Although he is aware of the range and variety of norms, his theoretical account is a form of crypto-functionalism in which norms are explained by their benefits. The analysis is open to two objections. Some norms do not benefit anyone, but are rather sources of pointless suffering. Also, even when norms do provide benefit for those who follows them (or to others), the causal mechanism by which these benefits explain their causes remains mysterious.

CT Lilnet Conference
CY MAY 30-31, 2002
CL LILLE, FRANCE
AB James Coleman's work often insists on the fact that sociology should focus on the asymmetric relationship, in contemporary society, between corporate and individual, or "natural", actors. In such an organizational society, behavior is rationalized, interdependencies are formally managed in a highly sophisticated way, and "natural actors" need sociologists' knowledge to hold their own. In order to build this knowledge, Coleman offers a sociological version of rational choice theory. This paper suggests that this new version of rational choice is not sufficient to account for individual and collective action in the organizational society. An alternative, neo-structural approach to social behavior is provided, in which actors are rational when they contextualize their own actions through appropriateness judgments. With these judgments, they politicise their exchanges and the management of their interdependencies. This politicisation includes myopic as well as far-sighted attempts at improving one's opportunity structure, particularly by creating or maintaining social niches or getting involved in status competition. In turn, this conception of actor's behavior leads to improved understanding of the social discipline that underlies social exchanges and collective action. It highlights the social processes that characterize organized settings and that are made possible by this discipline, such as particularistic solidaritics, social control and regulation. Thus, this neo-structural approach to rational choice theory pays particular attention to the meso level of social reality, a level that James Coleman and his models explore very little.

TI Coleman's social theory - too parsimonious?
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
ID RATIONALITY
AB James S. Coleman affirmed that his theory follows the principle of parsimony : it uses a minimum number of basic concept to account for social phenomena. He justifies parsimony itself as a means of unifying sociological theory on individualistic grounds, and set outs to use the model of an actor rationally pursuing self-interest to derive all consequences. This is clearly a very narrow starting ground, perhaps too narrow. In fact, it is not clear that he manages to draw all consequences from his nearly contractual model of society, as this model could have led to recognizing the existence of collective entities. Moreover, he ends up introducing an additional principle which exceeds the limits of rational choice theory - namely, actor's ability to identify with others - and is then led to analyze the concept of the identity of the "self", thus considerably extending the limits of classical methodological individualism.

   rationality
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

ID EARLY-CHILDHOOD
AB This paper tries to answer the question how it is possible that such a giant of sociology as James Coleman produced so little of what he considered the most important work for sociologists : good institutional design. I argue that the answer lies in the fact that the most serious problem for which Coleman pleaded for institutional design (ie to find a substitute for the vanishing primordial social organizations of family, church and neighborhood) could not even be adequately described let alone mitigated or solved by the highly simplified theory of action he borrowed from microeconomics. It is argued that a theory that would lend itself for institutional design in this area would have to be able to accommodate the considerable social influence on rationality.

TI Power in Coleman's work
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB Coleman's analysis of power fits into his overall project of uncovering the micro-foundations of macro-social phenomena : it aims both to explain and evaluate the extent to which distinctively modem organizational authority systems have usurped the power of natural persons, and also to propose remedies that would restore power to the latter. Coleman's vision of an overall transformation from a natural and primordial to a purposively constructed social environment is criticized for relying upon folk sociologies. A discussion follows of his analyses of the ways in which modern corporate actors allegedly usurp the power of individuals; of the ways in which the distinction between subjective and objective interests helps us understand corporate power; of the links between corporate power and responsibility and ways in which corporate actors can be made more responsible for the power they have; and of the extent to which the operations of power may be hidden from both observers and actors.

TI Coleman's conversion to rational choice theory: impressions and
   conjectures
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB Coleman came late to rational choice theory (RCT). He adopted it in reaction to impressionist sociology, which had begun to prosper in the mid 1960s, seeing RCT as a means of consolidating the discipline, which was straying from the scientific ethos. Moreover, from the 1970s to the 1990s, economic thought was being productively applied to sociological and political issues. But Coleman's main motivation for adhering to RCT was epistemological : RCT produced self-sufficient explanations. What motivated Coleman is comparable to what led Weber to methodological individualism. As early as 1989, in the review Coleman founded, Boudon put forward the idea that with a cognitivist rather than instrumental conception of rationality was possible, which would preserve RCT's self-sufficiency property while escaping the aporia to which instrumental rationality leads.

TI Social stratification of musical taste. The cultural legitimacy model in
   question
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
ID EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT; MASS-CULTURE
AB Sociology of artistic taste generally characterizes the behaviour of the upper classes by a liking for learned arts and a simultaneous rejection of popular arts and products of mass culture. The evolutions registered in surveys on cultural practice do not however fully validate this representation. What distinguishes behaviour in the upper classes is in fact not so much the familiarity with a legitimate culture, as is traditionally put forward, but rather the diversity of the preferences expressed, unlike the situation with the popular classes, where preferences appear to be more exclusive. It is therefore possible to set the traditional model of cultural legitimacy against a model of eclecticism, the impact of which this article aims to measure in relation to the data base provided by the survey on cultural practice in French people in 1997 on the subject of musical preference. After having examined the habits of the French on this subject there is firstly a strong confirmation of the model of eclecticism which appears however more like a prolongation of the cultural legitimacy model than like its refutation. Preference typology as developed by data analysis and the examination of social factors of distribution of individuals in the different profiles. of music-lovers defined as such, brings to light in second position a predominance of generational splits and an unequal distribution of cultural, capital and of musical competence.

DT Article
ID SELF-ESTEEM; PROGRESSION; ADOLESCENTS; SAMPLE; ABUSE
AB Howard S. Becker's study of the "career" of marijuana smokers became a reference for later ethnographic studies but has hardly been an inspiration for epidemiologists' statistical studies. This article aims first to better understand this apparent incompatibility by pointing out the pitfalls epidemiologists are exposed to when they analyze drug use. It then reexamines available data, with the purpose of drawing from Becker's theses a set of hypotheses that can be statistically validated. Lastly, these hypotheses are validated on the basis of responses to a self-administered questionnaire survey of 12,113 teenage pupils conducted in 1999 in mainland France. The results confirm the relevance of Becker's sequential approach for cannabis use, since they show that 1) use-related factors, namely type of supply point and use among peers, vary by cannabis consumption level; 2) the neutralization techniques Becker hypothesized may be seen to be operative in respondents' stated opinions. More generally, the article illustrates the possible complementarity between statistical and ethnographic approaches.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English

ID BUSINESS-CYCLE; UNITED-STATES; UNEMPLOYMENT; SUICIDE
AB Thinking in France on relations between crime rate trend and evolution of socio-economic context over time is underdeveloped. Recent studies in the United Kingdom suggest that the business cycle influences fluctuations in both property offenses and violent crime. Whereas pre-1970 research in the United States only rarely pointed up a direct link between crime rate and unemployment, post-1970 American studies are dominated by demonstrations of a direct correlation between the two. In this article, analysis of trends in unemployment, prices and wages, marriage among men, and schooling leads to an interpretation of delinquency and crime over the long term in which it is affirmed that an increase in opportunity, such as that attested to by increased consumer prices and wages over time, has a more pronounced role in the strong growth period of the cycle and influences property offenses more than violent crime, and that unemployment among young people without educational degrees is a factor working in favor of both theft and violent crime. This phenomenon was partially masked in periods where it was common to remain in the school system, such as early in the last decade of the twentieth century in France. Lastly, the fact that starting in the early 1980s fewer young people settled in couples and, more generally, the tension in relations between the sexes may also have worked to favor delinquency.

AB A dual sexual differentiation is crossing the world of French jazz. While jazz is a world of men, the singers are first and foremost women. More especially, the lady singers are positioned at lower levels of musical renown and value. An ethnographical study has detected at the very heart of musical practice three social processes which generate and legitimize this sexual hierarchization. Sexual musical concepts separate instrumentalists from singers. Where a lady places importance in the interpretation, the instrumentalists dream of composing, and this associates lady singers with commercial jazz, which is disparaging and demeaning. Male social conventions in the style of language and music guide work relations, making it difficult for lady singers to find and keep a lady-singer position in the jazz-music job market. Female stereotypes, shared by a majority of musicians, make the lady singer barely "employable" and finally put her in illegitimate musical positions. A conflictual hierarchization sets in, even though there is a large majority of these musicians who wish to live in harmonious parity.

TI Girls in school in France over the twentieth century: Investigating the

DT Article
ID DEMOCRATIZATION; EDUCATION
AB This article presents and analyzes trends in gender and social inequalities at school from the early twentieth century on, in light of developments in state-defined study program "supply" and economic context. It makes use of data from INSEE's Education, qualification, and career surveys (Formation-Qualification Professionnelle: FQP). Over the twentieth century in France, girls first caught up with boys, then overtook them, in access to lower and upper secondary school (collage and lycee),((1)) while segregation by gender for the various study options remained relatively unchanged. The reversal in gender inequality stands in contrast to slighter reductions in social inequality, which remained much greater throughout the period. Meanwhile, the social inequality hierarchy was not much affected, remaining similar for the two sexes, with the children of cadres sharply ahead of all others. (1) Girls of working-class origin were slower to catch up with their male counterparts, but they are well ahead today. Daughters of farmers and small self-employed business persons have benefited most. The claim made in many research studies of a double handicap for girls -gender and social background- is thus confirmed only for the earliest of the cohorts studied.

AB During the 1990s, new techno parties known as raves or free parties, started to appear on French territory and they met with a tremendous success. In the other European countries, where techno music is just as widespread, the development of free parties remained limited and at no point did it reach the huge phenomenon of society that it did in Great Britain and then in France. Yet, this French-British exception regarding the way in which the techno parties were organized and the level of participation has so far received no explanation. It is possible to develop a series of hypotheses in order to explain the appearance and the development of this movement by referring to the reasons and interactions of individuals placed within a precise national context : in particular, by highlighting the way in which the politicians of the British and then the French governments, faced with the emergence of specific social groups, managed to contribute to the creation and spreading of the free party phenomenon.

TI "Reducing" actor's rationality: Why go off the RMI(1) welfare program?
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB The "inactivity trap" model is based on a "narrow rationality" postulate according to which recipients of the RMI "decide" not to work because the wages they may expect to earn are lower than the welfare payments they receive. By this postulate, the other essential factor in an individual's non-employment is his or her length of time on welfare programs ("seniority"). Our analysis of 20,000 RMI recipient files shows that the explanatory value of this model is relatively weak, namely when it comes to what is assumed to be the disincentive effect of receiving the RMI It also shows that it is inadequate to reason entirely in terms of employment; the content of available work must also be taken into account. It is therefore necessary to abandon the narrow rationality model in favor of a model of contextualized rationality, the "good reasons" model, as it may be observed in 128 interviews with RMI recipients. On the other hand, because the interviews point up so many different and sometimes contradictory "good reasons", we may in turn question the relevance and usefulness of this model, which in fact interprets behavior rather than explaining it.

TI Justice principles and judgment practices in allotting emergency state
   financial aid in France
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB Set up in 1998 in response to a highly popular protest movement of "the unemployed and underprivileged", the Social emergency fund (Fonds d'Urgence Sociale: FUS) had I billion francs to distribute. Allotment of fund money was determined by decentralized state services. In accordance with government instructions, the procedure adopted in the department of Seine-Saint-Denis involved a kind of administrative casuistry: each request for aid was handled by an allotment commission that decided who was to receive what amount of aid on the basis of figures representing applicant's budget realities and arguments written by applicants themselves in their own favor. Commission decisions about applicant eligibility and sum to be allotted may thus be considered a kind of tragic choice in which agents evaluated arguments aimed at demonstrating applicants' necessity and suffering. On the basis of interviews with involved actors and a sample of three hundred applications, this article analyses the alleged principles of justice and the actual judgment practices underlying the commission's deliberations and decisions. Eligibility was mainly decided by calculating a "remainder to live on" after expenses and with reference to a threshold value, but there were also many exceptions to this rule. While sum allotted was fixed according to a very rough scale, it could also be determined with the intention of sending the aid recipient a "message". Analysis of the functioning of this welfare program suggests that contemporary politics of pity are structured, on the one hand, by recognition of merit and sympathy for distress, on the other, by the weight of contingency and arbitrariness.

TI East German playwrights and the reunification: organizational changes
   and a renewal of professional identities
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
ID ARTIST
AB The transition and the German reunification have led to the destructuring of institutions which in the GDR helped regulate the world of the theatre. These changes have an effect on a theatre configuration determined by three poles : theatre professions, the Ensembles which work like organizations of drama production and the intervention of public authorities. Here it has been decided to approach the question of transition through the profession angle, by showing an interest in the East-German playwrights. The mediation activity of the playwright, which is generally speaking important for German theatre, was given an extremely important status through the organization of the theatre in GDR. The professional identity of East-German playwrights was developed around three mainstays : training, politicization of theatrical work and the division of tasks within the Ensembles. The reunification, by destabilizing the structures of East-German drama production, confronted the playwrights with a modification of their professional environment, forcing them to redefine their mediation activities around new content, while developing the elements inherited from the former configuration. This puts forward a certain approach to the transition, seen more as a deformation of the former theatre configuration than a substitution of one configuration by another.

TI Gifts of blood and organs: The market and "fictitious" commodities
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
AB Richard M. Titmuss' study of blood donation is still a reference on the subject of giving for medical purposes. This article reviews Titmuss' main arguments, together with economists' reactions to his affirmation that a system based on giving and altruism is superior to one organized around the market and self-interested action. It then shows that the gift/market opposition is a reductive one, in that it does not take into account the industrial aspect of medical donation. Lastly, on the basis of empirical information about organ donation, the article brings to light the work of social construction without which, as Titmuss clearly understood, modem forms of giving could not have been established.

TI Adolescence, post-adolescence, youth: Revised interpretations
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB The terms adolescence, post-adolescence, and youth are often employed as near-synonyms to designate the life period between childhood and adulthood. In fact, the terms are linked to distinct sociological interpretations, though these may be only implicit. This article aims to clarify those interpretations, first on the basis of an article by Parsons, who, in 1942 proposed one of the first sociological analyses of "youth culture", defining adolescence as a culture of irresponsibility. The theme of "post-adolescence" developed later out of this idea. Other studies, on the contrary, sought to establish a radical distinction between adolescence and youth, the latter defined as "a new life period". Critical review of this thesis leads to revising it on two important points. First, though "youth" is distinct from adolescence as defined by Parsons, it does not constitute, or not as fully as had been believed, a clearly separate life phase relative to those preceding and following it; indeed, the primary characteristic of adolescence is that it establishes continuity between those phases. Second, international comparative studies conducted in the last few years show extraordinary country-to-country variation in the cultural dispositions and institutional arrangements that organize this life phase.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
AB First the author points out the importance of the "Introduction" to L'ethique economique des religions mondiales [The economic ethic of world religions] in order to understand the approach made by Weber and regrets that this was not placed at the beginning of the volume devoted to Confucianisme et taoisme [Confucianism and taoism]. He also underlines the fact that the English-speaking reader has for a long time benefited from more favorable reception conditions, despite any reserves one may have concerning the English translation. Finally, and more essentially, he goes on to reconsider a major theme of the book - political domination. Thus Weber recognizes the role of hydraulic regulation in the development of bureaucracy without relating it, as does Wittfogel, to the principles of domination. He especially points out the effectiveness of the politics followed by the emperors aiming to avert any appropriation of employment and so doing, avoiding the re-forming of a feudal order. He strongly emphasizes the points which differentiate, despite the exam system, Chinese bureaucracy from modern bureaucracy, in other words the absence of dissociation between administrative spending and personal spending and the fundamentally literary character, not at all specialized, of the training. However, he does show, at the same time, the way in which the political weakness of the body of civil servants conciliates with their cultural pre-eminence, the well-read tradition forming an expression of cohesion and a legitimization of the imperial order.

AB A critical analysis of the new translation of L'Ethique protestante et l'esprit du capitalisme (The Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism) (translated by Isabelle Kalinowski) brings to light a series of errancies, due to an obvious haste, but equally, and more seriously, to a wide ignorance of both the conceptual and semantic universe of Max Weber and of the history of protestant theology. The gravity and the multiplicity of errors cannot avoid having an effect on the deeper understanding of this venerable text on social sciences; their impact is such that one can but question the ethos which reigned over the realization of this task.

   the 4(th) and 5(th) Plans (1962-1970)
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB It was within the framework of the Plan, the collective enterprise for economic development and modernization of French society, that the notion of training, promoted on behalf of the notion of education, was imagined as a measurable dimension, on which qualification could be based. The following article describes the social operations for defining, codifying and providing equivalences for phenomenons which until this point were considered as being distinctive and without necessary or systematic links. At the heart of these operations was the construction of lists of training which, developed for technical reasons, more particularly to forecast the population flow requiring education in relation to the employment forecasts for each level of qualification, prevailed over the lasting representations of the social world, which guides the public policies and the individual behaviour. The durability of these lists indicates the strength of representation and collective belief which are behind them, resulting from the actions led during the 1960s in different parts of society and of which the Plan made a synthesis. Such were the various steps at the origin of the expression "the training/employment relation" which today has become a common name designating an established fact.

TI Industrial fluidity, organizational fragility
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB This article looks into the way in which the Renault plants today tend towards the management ideal known as industrial fluidity. A succession of heterogeneous technical solutions (fully-automatic production line, manual assembly line); an accumulation of managerial and procedurial systems structure and organize the continuity of production (in terms of quality/cost/delivery time) by acting on the technical and social dimensions of industrial fluidity. The linking of these accesses to fluidity reveals a set up based on eminently fragile foundations which resist thanks to the existence of voluntarily hazy compensation work from the flow operators. This work puts into action forms of social regulation which depend largely on social-technical systems of which they are a part. But far from this being relatively stable and converging autonomous regulation, this social practice is itself developed along a "razor edge".

DT Article
AB The scientific works of Bronislaw Malinowski started several years before the ethnographical study he carried out on the Trobriand Isles during the first world war. Our aim is to show to what extent his first work The family among the Australian aborigines. A sociological study (1913) forms a mould for further research. Here the author lays down the foundations for his future methodological innovations and draws the outlines to his first analyses of parenthood phenomena. Furthermore, Malinowski from this point gives crucial importance to the lack of knowledge regarding physiological parenthood which exists in certain groups of primitive people. On this issue, Malinowski never stood the slightest contradiction. In particular, during a controversy opposing him to a colonial administrator, Alex Rentoul, he took on such a brutal tone that one could wonder about the transferential dimension of this theme.

TI Durkheim and the problem of objectivity: a study of the Formes

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB At the heart of current debate on the sociology of knowledge, the status for the notion of objectivity is at the same time a fundamental presupposition for several interpretations of Durkheimian epistemology. This article proposes an analysis centered on the Formes elementaires de la vie religieuse [Elementary forms of religious life]. In this work, Durkheim is obliged to defend objectivity for the representation of relativist and constructivist implications of his own sociology of knowledge and religion. In spite of the aporia in his approach, the type of ontology required for his work constantly provides good arguments in favour of the thesis according to which there exists an independent (social) reality for our representations. If this is not sufficient to resolve all difficulties, it should dissuade us from according him the paternity of different, or even opposing theses, due to the fact that he does not succeed in fully demonstrating a particular thesis.

   analysis for Europe.
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB Based on data from an international study on religious attitudes (International Social Survey Programme, 1998), this article gives a rapid panorama of religion in Europe. It then shows how the integration of a religious system (on a scale extending from regular churchgoers to those without religion) has strong effects on ethical and political attitudes (sexual permissiveness, roles of men and women in society today, abortion, civic honesty, trust in institutions, political tendencies). Whatever the European country being examined, catholic or protestant integration is conveyed by more traditional, more conformist attitudes, situated further right wing, without there being a precise difference between catholics and protestants who are culturally quite close to each other today.

DT Article
AB The socio-economic analysis of youth employment in Japan leads to a better understanding of the factors which determine their level of participation in the workforce as well as the conditions in which their activity takes place. This analysis in particular points out the interaction between the flexibilization strategies of the labour force in the work place and the mechanisms of family dependence in which young people evolve. According to our interpretation of the increasing difficulties which young people meet on the job market, it is the nature of the social construction of youth employment which is concerned rather than a hypothetical change in work ethics.

TI The New Economic Sociology and market cohesion from personal relations

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
ID TRUST; PROFESSIONALS; ARRANGEMENTS; LABOR
AB The revival of economic sociology is based on the reassertion of the social dimension of economic action on the premise that the latter is always situated socially. Unlike assumptions of standard micro-economics, an economic exchange is never independent of person-to-person relations or of extra-economic factors. In this case it's still part of society. This article, while recognizing the contributions coming from the New Economic Sociology (NES), offers a discussion on these assumptions by questioning the way in which the NES conceptualizes the boundary between the social and the non-social part of market exchanges. This work demonstrates that the NES, while adhering essentially to the characteristics of much less thanprimarymuch greater than socialization of the market, offers an much less thanintimistmuch greater than vision of social cohesion which prevents it from considering the complete sociological specificity of the market cohesion. In view of taking advantage of this specificity, with a microsociological reading of Simmelian analyses of reciprocal action and recent ethnographical approaches of market cohesion, it is possible to re-imagine the elementary forms of social cohesion by insisting on the much less thansecondarymuch greater than socialization of the market. This critical reflection leads to the outlining of a research programme aiming to report on the operating conditions of the most ordinary modem economic life and based on much less thanpurelymuch greater than market relations.

AB The comparative research carried out on welfare states has become a particularly wealthy source for research on social sciences. It has made it possible for a number of scientific issues to come together (theory on genders, economic sociology, theory on international comparisons, sociology of international relations, neo-institutionalist theory) which are elsewhere often separate. In addition, this research benefits from an enviable integration of its analyses within political and social debates on today's world. The aim of this article is to present and analyse some of the most significant approaches of the contemporary period. Being unable to make an extensive analysis, the article concentrates on three debates : the analysis of the different forms of welfare states and a possible classification the link between globalization and evolution in social protection; the new political configurations of action within welfare states. In this way the article clearly shows the contribution of this research to the building of a neo-institutionalist theory which is also evolving.

AB Since the end of the 1970s, three different types of reform in social protection have been implemented in France : reduction of social deficit by putting up social contributions; sectorial reform to control social costs institutional alterations transforming the basis of the system. Blocking the first attempts at change by the social security was made easier by institutions belonging to social insurance. However governments, under pressure from Europe, managed to negotiate reduction measures applicable to social costs by separating more rigourously the social insurance sector and that of national solidarity. The institutional reforms were introduced first in a marginal fashion on the basis of ambiguous consensus, then were used to back up a global process of making the French social protection system a dualist system.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB With the creation of European monetary union (EMU), European welfare states have entered a new phase of development. The margins for manoeuvring public budgets have substantially decreased, while the unfolding of the four freedoms of movement within the European union (EU) have seriously weakened the traditional coercive monopoly of the state on actors and resources that are crucial for the stability of redistributive institutions. The article explores these issues adopting a Rokkanian perspective, i.e, building on Rokkan's pioneering insights on the nexus between boundary building and internal structuring. The first part of the paper briefly presents the theoretical perspective. The second pari sketches the development of national welfare institutions from their origin up to the early 1970. The third part describes the challenges that have emerged to the "social sovereignty" of the nation state, largely linked to the process of European integration. The final part offers some more speculative remarks of the potential de-structuring of the traditional architecture of social protection, with some hints at cross-national variations and possible developments at the EU level.

ID DEMONSTRATIONS; COVERAGE; MEDIA
AB Protease inhibitors, the first drugs to bring about real remission in AIDS, were first developed in 1996. Between the time they were proven effective and the time they became accessible to all AIDS patients in France, the available quantity of protease inhibitors was far from sufficient to satisfy the need. In response to this temporary "tragic choice" situation, the Conseil national du sida [National AIDS council] proposed that the drugs be distributed by lots; i.e., through random selection of patients from pre-established lists. The following is a monographic study of the genesis of that situation, the controversy caused by the recommendation to proceed by lot-drawing, and the consequences of that controversy. Its objectives are twofold: 1) to propose a model for analyzing controversies by studying how media coverage interacted with a specific collective action; 2) to show the ongoing relations within the particular network of actors -pharmaceutical companies, clinicians, AIDS patient advocacy groups, and public agencies and authorities- involved in getting anti-Hiv treatments onto the market in France.

AB For around twenty years, the exact audience for para-sciences in our societies has been under question. To what extent does the public state its belief in a certain number of phenomena such as the explanation of characters by astrological signs, thought transmission, bewitchment? In France a series of surveys has been carried out since the beginning of the 1980s. This article is based on the comparative analysis of the results of five surveys made between 1982 and 2000 on eleven different beliefs of this type. On examination, the data indicates that, contrary to popular opinion, these beliefs do not appear to have evolved significantly over the period. The analysis of sociodemographical and ideological determinants brings to light a number of regularities : women, young people, individuals who believe in life after death are more inclined to declare belief in para-sciences.

TI The sibling tie in adulthood: an analysis based on meeting frequency
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
ID CONTACT
AB What can be said of the sibling tie in adulthood? Analysis of a survey conducted by INSEE of meetings between or among brothers and sisters (survey sample: 6,000 French households) points to three main conclusions. First, there is little that is normative about the sibling tie: number of meetings varies greatly by individual. In contrast to direct filiation, relations between siblings seem determined by choice and interest more than status conditioned obligations. Second, inclination is nonetheless more likely to regulate sibling ties for men; for women, regulation is more likely to be status-conditioned. Third, the sibling tie is structurally secondary to direct filiation (mother and father-adult children): how often siblings see each other is a function of father's and/or mother's presence, and declines when individuals settle into couples and have their own children. The fact that the sibling tie functions as a substitute when direct filial ties are impoverished or lost further illustrates that, of the two direct blood ties, the sibling tie is structurally secondary. These properties of siblingship are probably particular to the cognatic or non-unilineal, "kindred" system which is that of modern Western kinship.

TI The relational competence: control of interaction and professional
   legitimacy - Barristers and mediators
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB The paper looks at the structural process defining the relationship between a practitioner and a client, exploring it both in terms of social interaction and as a professional performance, thus locating the analysis at the turnstile of these two domains of sociological theory. Two activities are scanned in this perspective, both close in their content and different in their context of exercise : the criminal defence by barristers and para-judicial forms of mediation. The expectations of the client concerning the professional performance compel the practitioner to negotiate a definition of the relational frame with him, thus defining the contents of his status and his achievement. The frame consists in a co-operative behaviour towards the purpose assigned to the relationship : the judicial defence or the resolution of the dispute. They proceed from a compromise between practitioner and layman, the latter being the author of the chosen solutions. In determining this relational regime, the practitioner shows a kind of competence underpinned by ethics as much as expertise. Besides, this process contributes to the legitimacy of the performance and hence of professionalism, which cannot be restricted to status or knowledge but implies an empirical definition of professional authority and independence.

TI Telephone sociability networks
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB This article aims to contribute to social network analysis through a study of telephone sociability. After reviewing the procedures used for apprehending the structure of sociability networks, several types of personal networks are defined through an analysis of relations conducted by telephone. While some of these networks involve a mere sum of interpersonal ties, with networks composed of a full set of different types of ties contrasting sharply with those characterized by virtual absence of all ties, others reveal the existence of networks based on preference, where the relevant opposition is between two types of exclusive ties: family and friendship. Social status does not suffice to understand such relational choices; these seem to involve instead a variety of distinctions associated with two relatively new modes of life: living alone and living outside the world of work. When these new dimensions are used to read these different types of sociability, we see that increasingly complex factors need to be invoked to understand social behaviors.

TI Managers in the margin: stigmatization of an intermediate hierarchy
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB The rationalization projects which have taken over large modern organizations have destabilized and weakened their intermediate hierarchy. The explanations in terms of organization define clearly the way in which this weakening is produced. They do not however explain so clearly the relative commonplace character of social marginalization of intermediate managers, observed in an insurance company. In spite of their repeated efforts to become the intended managers, these supervisors find themselves struck in a denigrated social position which has lost its prestige. Even if all salaried workers deplore this situation, they define it as being due to the personal incapacity of supervisors to evolve. The psychologization of social relations, shown by the salaried workers in their gestures and daily discussions, is in fact part of the psychological modernity, which characterizes the individualistic contemporary society.

AB This text proposes the analysis, based on a case study, of the mutual negotiations, strategies and adjustments brought about by the introduction of much less than competence logic much greater than in an organization. First, it shows that new human resource management rules introduced in this manner cause a renewal of the salaried-workers' exchanges and provokes diverse reactions, based on both criteria of equity and point of interest. Secondly, the text analyzes how judgment of competence is structured during the assessment interview and the resources put forward by the actors to build on or to contradict the legitimacy of this judgment. It illustrates how difficult it is to implement much less than objective much greater than assessment of people in work contexts where the same possibilities of evolution are not offered to everyone. Finally, the text raises the question of judging between individual and collective competence.

DT Article
AB Science and technology are characterized by considerable intellectual and institutional fragmentation -a product of unceasing specialization. In this article T. Shinn shows how a little studied transverse science and technology community, the research-technology movement, promotes "pragmatic-universality". The multi purpose and generalist instruments generated by research-technology foster a technical lingua-franca in academia, industry, state technical services, the military and so forth. Research-technology also facilitates cognitive and institutional boarder crossings between disciplines and professional spheres. Shinn argues that divisions of labor in science and engineering are not detrimental to universality but are instead basic to its establishment. Demarcated niche audiences independently test and validate ideas and usage. Those which survive diverse and locally imposed testing are ultimately held in common by all groups, thereby becoming a universally accepted consensual stock of knowledge.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB Biology-inspired sociology of the nineteenth century, at least that of major thinkers such as Saint-Simon, Comte, Spencer, and Durkheim, cannot be understood with reference to an opposition between "mechanical" and "organic" models. It was not based on the Romantic figure of the organism as counter-value to the machine, but rather centered around the notion of organization as it was debated in the discipline of natural history over the first half of the nineteenth century. In the sociological thought of this period, therefore the logic-based theme of classifying organized forms plays a crucial role.

TI Playing the << supporting role >> in a conjugal team - The case of the
   wives of a prefect or sub-prefect
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB The wives of a prefect or sub-prefect are expected to play a role alongside their husband, in public too. Without being misappreciated, this domestic work is often not taken into account; the context is in fact unfavourable to the extent that contemporary society advocates individualization and barely legitimizes such roles, defined as a relation based on personal dependence. The weight of a prefect, or sub-prefect and his wife in the representation of their work meant that it was necessary to follow the Goffmanian analysis for the dramaturgical perspective. The concepts of team, role, on and off stage make it easier to understand the position of the prefect's or sub-prefect's wife in the prefectorial environment. Based on a collection of twenty in-depth interviews, it was shown that the participation of these wives in their husband's work varied from one person to another. To compose their role as much less than wife of much greater than, these women selected from the list available the role they thought they should play. The cultural and social resources they have, has an influence on the time they devote to their role as well as on the choice of repertory which are not all identical neither in terms of legitimacy nor power. The problem of relations between sexes or of ways of life, frequently excludes the notion of role : this article is to show that it is possible, as long as a new definition is provided, to use this notion to analyze the ways in which women behave when assigned to domestic work.

AB In the 1960s, researchers and scholars with very different approaches to studying the peasantry met up in Paris. For American anthropologists, the peasantry in Europe and South America constituted a new field of study; French geographers and historians (particularly Medievalists) had amassed a great number of regional studies; the tradition of the populist Russian agronomists had been rediscovered; and Marxist economists and sociologists were trying to account for vestiges of the peasantry in light of Marx's prediction that peasants would disappear. These different disciplines and approaches, in part impelled by the French agricultural revolution and the repeated failure of socialist-run agriculture, were able to develop together a theory of the peasantry.

AB The phenomenon of debt slavery has either been greatly underestimated or, on the contrary, overestimated through confusion with other ways of dealing with the debtor, like pawning, for instance, or the possibility of reimbursing debt through labor. After carefully defining debt slavery, the article shows how widespread it has been, and explains its social significance as follows: inequalities between rich and poor, already present in most primitive societies, may be redefined in terms of masters and slaves. The transformation, or threatened transformation, of a debtor into a slave considerably strengthens the power of the dominant. The article concludes with a hypothesis about the origins of the state.

TI Adolescence, post adolescence, youth: a re-appraisal on a number of
   interpretations.
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB Adolescence, post-adolescence, youth are terms which are often used in similar ways to refer to the period of time between childhood and adulthood. However the exact choice of term can sometimes implicitly involve a distinct sociological interpretation, an aspect which this article will attempt to clarify. To initiate this reflection is an article by Parsons who, in 1942, put forward one of the first sociological analyses of youth culture, defining adolescence as a one of irresponsibility. Later this idea was to be prolonged with the appearance of the post adolescence theme. Further work proposed, on the contrary, to differentiate clearly between adolescence and youth, the latter being defined as a new age of life. A critical reading of this particular thesis however leads to the reinterpreting of two important points : firstly, youth, if clearly distinguished from adolescence, as defined by Parsons, does not represent, to the extent that was once imagined, a phase in life, clearly separate from those around it; its main characteristic is rather to provide a continuity between the different phases. Secondly, comparative work carried out on an international basis has since shown that the cultural tendencies as well as the institutional setup which influence this phase of life show a very wide diversity among the different countries.

AB The main interest of this article is the political impact of the green, anti-nuclear and peace movements. After a rapid review of the current status of research on the consequences of social movements, more particularly on the works relating to the effects of various movements on state policy, and by putting forward some of the major variables to explain what must be taken into account when studying the impact of social movements on state policy, we take a quick look at the various movements on the themes of the environment, nuclear energy and peace in the United States, Italy and Switzerland. To conclude, we propose both a comparative and longitudinal study which systematically examines the impact of social movements on public policy. Following this approach, the impact can hardly be autonomous, but is often the result of a combination of protest with three other factors : the structure of political opportunity (in particular of political alliance), the position of public opinion in relation to the undertakings of these movements and the prominence of these undertakings. Our theoretical arguments are confronted with the empirical results obtained for green, anti-nuclear and peace movements in the three countries over the period 1975 to 1995, Our analysis shows the impact of these three factors in a decisive way, but differently, depending on the movement, so as to modify the relation between protest and public policy.

TI Resisting feelings of social inferiority for people in situations of

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
ID IDENTITY
AB The principal remarks concerning illiteracy refer to the suffering and global language distress to which is sometimes added the image of an illiterate person in a world of social isolation. Must one accept this representation of illiteracy ? Circumspectly, our sociological position is to turn the problem around, no longer considering the illiterate person solely from the point of view of his/her deficit but also from that of his/her capacity to act and to integrate socially. Consequently, the aim of this article is to show that illiteracy is not synonymous with violence or exclusion, but a situation where two social elements are engaged :that of a handicap where there are risks of inferiority or social indignity, and that of practical resources where the illiterate person develops a resistance to this stigmatization. To support this hypothesis, we encountered those concerned in order to examine how illiteracy is conceived, thought and spoken about and experienced. During the study which took place in the Bordeaux region, 69 people in a situation of illiteracy were interviewed. As a conclusion to this article it can be observed that illiteracy is not always felt to be a major handicap by those identified as such and that their experience is not limited to a feeling of disgrace crossed with guilt.

TI Religion and the economy. Mauss, Simiand and the Durkheim programme.
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
AB The aim of this article is to show that the works of Durkheim contain two research programmes on sociology and the economy. The first programme is concerned by the appreciation of economic categories and by the institutions which allow the market system to function. The second programme, barely outlined in Les formes elementaires de la vie religieuse suggests there is a relation between religion and the economy. Both programmes were developed by other Durkheimians : Simiand (and Halbwachs) for the first, and Mauss for the second. It is however important to observe that in the 1930s, both programmes came together to work on donation and currency issues. To finish, the article puts forward the idea that the Durkheim perspective could serve to prolong Weberian questioning on the relation between religious ethics and the modern economy.

AB Following previous works, the present paper starts by offering a clear definition of the category of gift as opposed to that of exchange. It is argued that social anthropology has generally confused the two categories, describing as gift what is in reality exchange. But in Melanesia as in some traditional societies of Africa or America, the exchanges take specific forms, different from those known in modem societies. The particular aim of this article is to define this kind of exchange which is neither an exchange of gifts nor an exchange of commodities.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
AB In reply to a popular movement << of the unemployed and those without job security >>, the setting up of the Fonds d'urgence sociale (Social emergency fund) in January 1998, resulted in the distribution of a billion francs organized by the decentralized services of the state. In conformity with state instructions, the procedure adopted in the Seine-Saint-Denis is that of administrative casuistry where each file is dealt with by an allocation committee whose decisions are based on factual elements of income and a personal statement to justify the request. The decisions which decide on the eligibility of the request and on the amount to be allocated can also be considered as choices based on sympathy, in which agents are confronted with arguments in terms of suffering and necessity of those who made the request. After studying interviews with those concerned and a sample of three hundred files, an analysis of the principles of justice and decision-making underlying the proceedings can be proposed. If eligibility is mainly decided through the calculation of << remaining amount to live off >> in reference to a threshold value, there are however many exceptions. If the allocated sum is calculated according to a highly approximative scale, it must also take into account the intent to convey a << message >> to the beneficiaries. This is the way in which the two elements are combined together in contemporary policies of sympathy : recognition of merit and sympathy towards misfortune, on the one hand; the exercising of arbitrary judgment and the weight of events, on the other.

DT Article
ID SOCIOLOGY
AB Les Heritiers by Pierre Bourdieu and Jean-Claude Passeron has become a classic in French education sociology. This article examines the principal relevant elements, today forgotten, as regards the intellectual, social and institutional context in which this classic was written. It presents the position of the book in the revived education sociology at the beginning of the 1960s, where a large part of the work focused on the democratization of education. The book is shown to be different to previous studies on schooling, in particular to those of Alain Girard, on several points. Finally, the article analyses the way data was gathered and processed by the authors of Les Heritiers. If the collection method appears to be very <<traditional>>, the processing method introduces some innovation in comparison to previous research. By examining this particular case, the article presents certain characteristics of the history of French sociology in the 1960s.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB The article traces the evolution of small fruit and vegetable transformation businesses in the Provence from the end of the Second World War until the mid 1990s. The apparently paradoxical characteristic of their evolution leads to a questioning of the most common forms of business, which intend that flexible production and organization modes follow on from the symbolic rigid forms of the post-war growth period. The analysis of the diffusion processes of new production models by the principal actors, notably through public policies for businesses, makes it possible to show what this itinerary has gained from the major tendencies in operation, for which this type of organization is often marginalized. It is an occasion to look back on a number of representations of productive organization over the period of the Trente Glorieuses (a period in France between 1945 and 1975 characterized by strong economic growth).

AB The analysis of social representations requires an appropriate methodology. The interview is not the only tool used by the sociologist; it is also possible to carry out qualitative surveys with questionnaires and large sampling. In this article several questions are put forward adapted to the structural approach and associated processing methods, These questionnaires are not simply looking for the opinion of those surveyed but also the organization of their representation. They allow access to cognitive and social dimensions of those questioned. These questionnaires are presented with examples and a critical analysis of their limits.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB The notion of disaffiliation put forward by Robert Castel is tested in this study in a specific area : the former red suburbs of Paris. The idea of disaffiliation, in a better way than exclusion or relegation, makes it possible to analyse the impact of casualization of the wage society. However, due to its Durkheim relations, this notion underestimates the contradictions with which social integration is permanently in conflict, and does not really mention counter affiliations which are important in these popular districts. The notion of anomie which is apparently closely related does not really express the serious conflicts of normative standards to be found in, much less thanincivilitiesmuch greater than. Today, political and identity disaffiliation to the working-class town strengthens the effects of disaffiliation to the wage society. The reaffiliation processes which affect, on the one hand, the middle levels of wage earners, especially through the participative approach, on the other land, a juvenile subculture which identifies itself in rap music, are heterogeneous and incomplete, indicating no clear line forward for the future.

TI Dynamics of girls' education: the dual handicap in question.
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
ID DEMOCRATIZATION; FRANCE
AB This article traces the evolution of sexual and social inequality at school since the beginning of the 20(th) century, enlightened by the social and economic context. It is based on data Formation - Qualification Professionnelle survey, collected by the INSEE. The history of boys' and girls' education shows how the girls caught up with the boys, followed by a reversal of the situation to the profit of girls in gaining access to the different levels of the 1(st) and 2(nd) cycles in secondary education, while respecting relatively speaking, the inequality between sexes depending on the branch and field of study. The reversal of sexual inequality is in contrast to a more discrete reduction of social inequality which remains important throughout the whole period. The hierarchy of social inequalities is little affected and remains similar for both sexes; children of senior executives stand out clearly from the others. In the working-classes it took longer for girls to catch up with boys, but today they have a strong advance. Girls from farming and self-employment backgrounds are the first to benefit from this evolution. The theory of a dual handicap due to sex and class, upheld in several works, is therefore only confirmed for the older groups.

AB The objective of this study is to theorize the rules, systems and behaviour in rural lifestyles in Cameroon within the context of transfer between productive systems. These systems are no longer reliant on small private farming units for export. The inequality in the gaining of share capital depends on the different choices in home production : single-crop farming or innovation-diversification. These strategies are part of a redistribution of social roles between the elder and the younger, men and women, and prefigure social individualism based on two new types of solidarity.

AB What is a company's wage policy ? What is it used for ? More than just a simple means used by management to attract and mobilize its workforce, it is the regulation of exchanges between a firm and its salaried workers. This regulation is the process by which a firm defines the contents of the exchange and how, it wants this exchange to evolve. Wage policy is developed within a process of collective step, during which wage principles are defined by the actors and given legitimacy. The aim of this article is to illustrate this process from observations recorded in several large firms, analysing how the exchange of work between a firm and its salaried workers transforms itself when going from wage policy founded on qualifications to that founded on competence. This generates modifications in the rules of individual and collective actors as well as in the respective weight of these actors in the regulation process. Without eliminating the role of the branch of activity, these new policies help give greater autonomy to firms.

AB The study of 130 cases of collaboration between the CNRS and firms makes it possible to analyse the interlinking of exchanges between organizations in networks of individual relations. It shows that even if the collaborations are often imitated by the networks of individual relations, there are several mechanisms, refer-red to in this text as delinking processes, which allow organizations to step into this initial interlinking, and to such an extent that the collaborations keep little trace of the conditions of their creation, neither in their content, nor in their development. However, the choice of partners and their location are reliant on the moment when exchanges were first initiated, which explains the well-known phenomenon of tire effects of spatial proximity.

AB The study by Richard M. Titmuss devoted to blood donation is still used today as a reference when concerned with donations in the medical field. This article gives the central theses of Titmuss and the reactions of economists faced with the affirmation of the superiority of a system based on donation and altruism compared with a system organized around a market and specific action. The article then illustrates that market/donation opposition reduces reality, as it omits the industrial dimension which plays a crucial role in the case of medical donation, Finally, based on informations regarding organ donation, the article explains the social structure without which, as Titmuss understood well, modern donation cannot be developed.

AB The study made by Howard S. Becker, devoted to the, career, of marijuana users has become a reference for ethnographical surveys carried out later on, but hardly inspired the statistical work done by epidemiologists. This article first attempts to understand more clearly this apparent incompatibility, by underlining the inevitable failings when giving an epidemiological analysis of drug use, After this, the re-examination of the data available makes it possible to associate the theses developed by Becker with a series of hypotheses which can be validated by statistics. This validation is made using a self-led survey carried out in schools in 1999 with 12 1 13 teenagers in metropolitan France. The results obtained confirm the relevance of a sequential approach for the use of cannabis. On the one hand, according to the degree of consumption in question, the factors associated with this use vary (notably the places where the drug is supplied and used among peers). On the other hand, the neutralization techniques brought up by Becker find a convincing echo in the opinions declared by the surveys. More generally, this article illustrates the possible complementarity between statistical and ethnographical approaches.

AB The aim of this paper is to examine whether a long-term trend can be identified in the mobility regime of French society from the middle of the century. It begins with a review of the international literature on temporal trends in social fluidity within modern societies. Analysing recent French research which has concluded that inequality of opportunity has remained unchanged in France during the last two decades, the paper argues that such a conclusion can only have resulted from the use of insufficiently powerful statistical techniques. The second part of the paper analyses father-son and father-daughter mobility tables drawn from national representative surveys carried out in 1953, 1970, 1977, 1985 and 1993 (N=35,741 for males and 18,484 for females). The use of log-linear and log-multiplicative models reveals that the statistical association (as measured with the logarithm of the odds ratio) between social origin and destination has declined steadily by 0.5 % a year over a period of forty years. This finding highlights a slow but continuous trend towards a reduction in inequality of opportunity from the middle of the century. Of the twelve million French men and women between the ages of 35 and 59 who were in employment in 1993, nearly half a million would have belonged to different classes without this forty year increase in social fluidity. The paper concludes that the thesis of temporal invariance in the intergenerational mobility regime cannot be maintained for France, but that the reasons of this change still remain to be ascertained.

TI Being a policeman: from informal flexibility to bureaucratic severity.
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

AB Based on an empirical study of over 400 interviews, and on an analysis which was part of the strategic analysis, this article illustrates how the policeman managed to free from the formal procedures which encumber his organisation in order to build, over a period of time, a relationship with his fellow citizens, based less on severity and authoritarianism and more on a certain benevolence and discretionary use of the law. This way of working reveals itself to be a generator of tensions between, on the one hand, a strong professional identity, built on these interactions, and on the other hand a highly formalistic organisation. Today. the evolution of morals, the internal crises which shake up the institution and the reactions of its directors have deeply modified the policeman's working environment, introducing a withdrawal of bureaucracy and favouring internal logic in order to adapt to a public which meanwhile has become more difficult.

ID BUSINESS-CYCLE; UNITED-STATES; UNEMPLOYMENT; SUICIDE
AB Reflection on the relations between temporal evolution of criminality and the evolution of the socioeconomic situation is rather rough at the present time in France. In the United Kingdom. recent studies suggest that the economic cycle influences at the same time fluctuations in crimes on property, and fluctuations in crimes on people, In the USA, if before 1970 it is rarely said that there is a direct link between the criminality rate and unemployment, there is however a direct correlation which dominates in studies after 1970. The analysis of temporal evolution in unemployment, prices and salaries, in the male marriage rate and schooling put forward an interpretation of long-term delinquency and crime. The idea becomes apparent that the increase in opportunities, indicated by en evolution in consumption prices and in salaries, plays a more marked role during a period of sharp growth and has a stronger influence on predation than on violence, that the unemployment of unqualified young people is a factor which favours both delinquency for appropriation and violence. This phenomenon is masked partially in the periods where keeping young people in the school system was in full action, during the last decade of the 20th century, Finally. a reduction in the number of couples setting up. and more generally the tension in relations between sexes. could also have encouraged delinquency from the beginning of the 1980s.

TI Temporal stratification of taste: The social diffusion of first names
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB Because it involves objectifying esthetic preferences in official records, parents' choice of name for their newborn child is one of the best materials for empirically testing the classical hypothesis of vertical social diffusion of taste. The present study is based on a representative sample (N=367,000) of first names of persons born in France between 1930 and 1988. The proportion of innovative choice (i.e., choice made at the very beginning of the diffusion process) in the various socio-occupational categories provides an indicator for a temporal hierarchy of taste. This hierarchy, which corresponds closely to the nomenclature of socio-occupational categories used by the French national statistics institute INSEE (Institut national de la statistique et des etudes economiques), tends to become compressed over time. To grasp the full meaning of the temporal stratification of taste, the hierarchy obtained with this indicator is compared to those for the various standard dimensions of social stratification.

AB The division of a country's population into occupied and unoccupied persons -a distinction that stands as the common foundation for socio-occupational classifications that vary from country to country- seems so widely used and generally accepted as to be almost invisible. The strangeness of this solid construct, however, invites us to examine the long and difficult process that culminated, in the late nineteenth century, with the adoption of a definition of "being occupied" based on a single criterion: the marketability of a person's labor. This neglected aspect of census history enables us to shed light on the nature and diverse national rhythms of a development which it is not excessive to regard as a revolution in statistical representations of work.

AB The aim of this article. based on interviews carried out on a school-going public and on a study of statutory texts defining pupils' rights. is to find out how the question of rights is introduced into the practice of the actors within the education system. In a more general manner, these pupils' rights remain very formal and they are rarely present in the subjective experience of pupils. Internal rules and regulations of the school present these rules in a limited fashion and the punishment system is often judged as the arbitor by the pupils. An essential question is to know how the school order is built. The author is trying to find out to what extent the effective rights of the pupils which provide the structure of the everyday school life are based on legal texts, on relations of domination (determined by the status of reaching the majority. the social status or the diploma), or on contextualized teacher-pupil interpersonal arrangements.

ID SOCIAL-MOVEMENT ORGANIZATIONS; INSURGENCY
AB This article examines the conditions under which, in June 1975, a marginalized, stigmatized population -the prostitutes of the French city of Lyon- took the step of collective action, occupying a church for more than a week to protest against police repression. It highlights the difficulties these politically inexperienced women encountered in mobilizing, namely preventing defections and choosing an appropriate mode of action; difficulties they were able to surmount thanks to resources provided by outside supporters endowed with practical knowledge in matters of collective action (activists in a group with close ties to the broad movement known as catholicisme social((1)) and feminists). Despite this assistance, however, the prostitutes' mobilization quickly declined and soon expired, in part because of the leaders' defection.

DT Article
AB Rather than query about the under-equipping of "old-aged people" in "technical objects" and explain it in terms of, resistance to changes. this article puts forward the hypothesis of the rationality of use and non-use of the older-aged population. Semi-directive interviews with a double sample (60-year-old retired people living in couples; widows and widowers. more in their 70s) and based on a diversified selection of technical appliances, firstly made apparent four,, logics of use, around which the interviews were run : a logic of use, a logic of identity, a logic of mediation and a logic of evaluation, These four logics Acre then used as analysis keys, to relate the evolution of the use during the aging process, which itself is based on a double process : on the one hand, the occupation of successive positions in the story of life (the first years of retirement, losing one's husband/wife) : on the other hand, the effects that are a direct result of age (physical deficiency : the realization of finiteness : detachment). Finally, it was possible to outline a classification of technical objects according to these logics of use.

TI Measuring crime - Police statistics and victimisation surveys
   (1985-1995)
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB For many years, measuring crime on the sole basis of computations of the operations of the public agencies in charge of its control implied great implicit confidence in the adequacy of their action to expectations for safety -maintenance. Over the last thirty years, all comparable countries have gradually come to resort at least partially to surveys, revealing their increasing doubts about this adequacy. In 1996 the INSEE [the French national institute for statistics] inserted a module on victimisation in its survey of the living conditions of households, thus yielding an opportunity to measure medium-term variations from one decade to another, for the first time in France. Comparison of these findings with the only national survey available so far (CESDIP, 1986) shows how different the picture is for violence and property offences, in terms of numbers and of trends. It is also possible to evaluate the extent -variable, depending on the kinds of victimisation- to which official statistics still reliably account for trends as well as for orders of magnitude. Aside from its methodological teaching, this analysis modifies and clarifies present controversies over crime.

AB From the 1980s, research on reading made an attempt to deepen the knowledge on how people read, This research wanted to redefine the activity of reading in terms of genesis and dynamics through the analysis of readers' itineraries. The description of what readers are, the maintaining or the modification of their interests during the different stages of their school or professional life or of their existence. the identification of the books they have read, the way they read, makes it possible to identify precisely their different paths. Finally. this research will allow there to be a renewal of the work done on the way people read and to suggest more detailed analysis of the different ways of reading similar hooks and to study the different ways of interpreting the same book.

TI Around Dominique Monjardet's Sociologie de la force publique - Recent
   books and articles in French in the field of sociology of the police
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Review
AB In 1997 and 1998 several books were published in French on the sociology of the police. Two of these works, both published in Quebec, have essentially practical or programmatic aims; a collection in homage to Lode Van Outrive, published in Belgium, contains only a few articles on the police, some of outstanding quality. Finally, the work published in France by D. Monjardet, the most important French sociologist of the police, offers a remarkable synthesis of twelve years of research. Using a truly exemplary sociological approach, Monjardet analyzes the characteristics of police work and the police profession in France, demonstrating the weakness of the political authority's control over the police and elucidating the mechanisms that give the police its considerable operational freedom within society. At present Monjardet's work is the main French reference in this field, one that is developing considerably in France.

AB The phenomenon of enslavement through debt has been largely underestimated or, on the contrary, confused with the different forms of exploitation of the indebted (person used as security, work to pay off debt). After having clearly defined its aim, the article shows the extent of enslavement through debt on a worldwide basis. Its main social signification is : inequality between rich and poor, already highly apparent in the: majority of primitive societies, redefinable in terms of masters and slaves. This transformation, or the risk of such a transformation, considerably reinforces the power of the dominant. The article ends with a suggestion regarding the origins of the State.

DT Article
AB This article presents an analysis of relations between generations, within the family and with public/private interface, based on the study of cultural transmission and forms of mutual assistance. It uses data from a three-generation survey built in such a way that the notion of generation becomes operative, by making family, historical and welfare generations coincide. The results show that transmission and transfer between generations, similar to the way they operate in family interactions, work as mediators of social change, transmission links of the welfare state and economic and social regulators. The relations between generations are closely connected to the relations between sexes. Social mobility plays an important role in the determination of their solidarity and of their cultural influence. This study also shows the necessity to take into account a minimum of three generations in order to perceive the temporal dimension which establishes the specificity of these relations.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
AB This article proposes to add a contribution to the analysis of networks based on a survey on telephone sociability. After specifying the procedures used to perceive the structure of sociability networks, several types of personal networks were defined by analyzing telephone relations. Whereas some reply to an additional logic of interpersonal connections, in which the networks accumulate all the types of connections in opposition to those defined by the absence of all the connections, the others reveal the existence of a preferential logic, in which networks centered on a type of exclusive connection, normally family or friend, are in opposition with each other. Social status would appear to be insufficient when trying to understand the relational choices which in fact are part of a diversity of divisions associated to the new forms of solitary life and life when not at work. Taking in the differences in sociability in these different dimensions therefore illustrates an increasing complexification of factors in the understanding of social behaviour.

TI Internal contract formalization in business and its limits. The case of
   software design
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB Businesses are at the present time a place where there is a multiplication of internal contracts and a generalization of market reference. Such contract formalization is aiming to give greater responsibility to each operative unit as regards its costs, thus reducing waste. The study of the present case, relative to software design, reveals however the perverse effects of formalization and compartmentalization, likely to harm the correct running of software projects. In fact the success of these projects depends on a regular adaptation of software in order to integrate emerging needs or to resolve unforeseen problems. All software projects therefore lead to numerous amendments and successive contracts. However. the temporary close down imposed by these contracts prevents an informal redistribution of tasks and skills which are in fact necessary when trying to solve problems rapidly. The stability of contractual relations thus depends, on one hand, on the capacity of the parties to remain united in time for the correct running of the software and, on the other hand, on a regular adaptation of the contractual context in order to know the investments accorded to each party to carry out the project. Often confronted with the problem of excess in terms of delivery time and cost, it could be asked whether internal contracts are not just rather empty frameworks.

ID FRANCE
AB Higher education has undergone many changes over the last few decades, allowing admittance to an increasing flow of "new students", most of which are of modest origin and with a professional secondary-education background. This increase in diploma holders has reinforced social differentiation within the existing courses. This article proposes a better understanding of the new issues of discrimination in relation to the admission of a large number of technology graduates. It analyses their rather paradoxical choice of course, and their studies in higher education, from which spring misunderstanding. incomprehension, and to finish, individual disillusionment and collective downgrading. The carter path of technology graduates today is the reflection of a growing differential instability : another way of reproducing in higher education the differences already encountered at school.

TI The "service class": middle classes in British sociology
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB British sociology over the last fifteen years has produced an abundant supply of literature on the middle classes. These works are closely linked to the realization that mental categories are inadapted when required to be used as traditional instruments to analyze the evolution of the development model of western economies and societies in the after-war period. They are also linked to the fact that there has been a large increase in the number of socio-professional categories not belonging to the possessing elite nor to popular categories (or unqualified). Specific denominations have been made to designate what has often been called in France "les nouvelles classes moyennes salariees" (" the new salaried middle classes,"). Unlike what happened in France, where this terminology remained vague and where this subject inspired few new works, in Great Britain, a large conceptualization project was undertaken based on the notion of "service class". Authors with very different views took part in this work, organizing debates with cumulative effects. In no way confined to a sub-field of the discipline, they were able to examine and bring in changes over its full breadth.

TI The methodological "I". Being implicit and explicit examined through

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
AB Four arguments, often interwoven, are put forward to legitimize the exponentially growing use of the first person in social science: the modernity of writing, the constitution of an alternative epistemology, the search for a more moral posture and methodological validation. It is more particularly this last point which is being looked at in this article. Is the radical implication of anthropology in this field a methodological requirement ? And how exactly should it be more explicit in relation to its own posture during the research process ? If non-implication and the lack of being explicit are apparently hardly defensible today, a study of several typical cases of strong implication does not in fact make it possible to rule conversely, in other words, in favour of there being a methodological advantage in maximum personal investment strategies, in comparison to more common forms of empathy or immersion, specific to prolonged surveys. Furthermore, the arguments in favour of a systematic intent to be explicit which surpasses a moderate use of reflexivity are not much more convincing either. If being in the field gives the researcher the scope for greater affective investment, what he says about his/her personal relationship with local actors is not as methodologically interesting as some would claim.

AB Science and technology are characterized by considerable intellectual and institutional fragmentation - a product of unceasing specialization. In this article T. Shinn shows how a little studied transverse science and technology community, the research-technology movement, promotes much less than pragmatic-universality much greater than. The multi purpose and generalist instruments generated by research-technology foster a technical lingua-franca in academia, industry, state technical services, the military and so forth. Research-technology also facilitates cognitive and institutional boarder crossings between disciplines and professional spheres. Shinn argues that divisions of labor in science and engineering are not detrimental to universality but are instead basic to its establishment. Demarcated niche audiences independently test and validate ideas and usage. Those which survive diverse and locally imposed testing are ultimately held in common by all groups, thereby becoming an universally accepted consensual stock of knowledge.

AB Having studied feeding in young childhood by means of a survey on mothers with children under the age of three, there would appear to be two modes in the diffusion of rules on how to feed infants : a scholarly mode, characterized by very little experience in infant care and the need to inquire through legitimate authorities, which are the paediatrician or paediatric books, found more often amongst women belonging to upper classes; a family mode, characterized by intergenerational transmission of infant care which is more typical of women from the working classes. The opposition between these two modes shows how ambivalent the practice of breast feeding is, corresponding both to scholarly criteria as regards infant feeding and to traditional practice of some fractions of the working classes, and is to be found at both extremities of the social ladder. The results of this study bring one to question the diffusion scheme traditionally used to give the results of paediatric standards application.

AB Professional groups are a constant reference for the Durkheim analysis of the division of social labour. However, according to Durkheim, they require a legislator in order to gain real substance. The restitution right, initially forged for the sake of observation of social solidarity, at the beginning of the 20(th) century became the tool making it possible to envisage such an action from the State. The reform stemmed from the civil service organization where it was part of a status, going on to touch other professional groups. By means of this action, the State drew closer to social activities, without actually mixing with them.

AB In the 1960s, different tendencies in the study of peasantry met in Paris. American ethnologists discovered in European and South-American peasantry a new scope for study, French geographers and historians (in particular medievalists) grouped together regional studies. The tradition of Russian populist agronomists was rediscovered, marxist economists and sociologists questioned themselves on the survival of peasants, which refuted the prediction by Marx as regards their disappearance. Thanks to these different trends, and under the pressure of the French agricultural revolution and repeated failures of socialist farming, a theory on peasantry was developed.

TI Sibling ties in adulthood. Based on frequency-of-meetings approach
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
ID CONTACT
AB What is siblingship in adulthood ? A close look at a survey carried out by the INSEE for 6 000 households dealing with meetings between the brother(s) and/or the sister(s) leads to three main conclusions : 1) The sibling tie would appear to not have very strong norms : the number of meetings varies greatly from one person to another. Unlike relations between direct descendants, those between siblings are governed by choice and interest more than by statutory obligations. 2) For men, regulation of the sibling tie is based more on affinity than for women for whom it is comparatively more statutory. 3) Finally the sibling tie is structurally second when compared to the direct line tie (father and mother-adult children): the frequency of relations between siblings depends on the father-mother presence and declines when the individuals settle down as a couple and have children. The Fact that the sibling tie serves as a substitute when the direct line either does not exist or breaks down is another illustration of the structural second position of siblings among primary kin. In this case it is probably a question of sibling tie properties belonging to the cognatic system of a kindred,, which is the contemporary western kinship.

AB Sociology of biological inspiration from the XIXth century - at least the important names such as Saint-Simon, Comte, Spencer and Durkheim - is not understandable if one refers to the opposition between " mechanical models " and " organic models ". This sociology is not based on the romantic figure of the organism as a counter enhancement of the machine: it turns around the notion of organization as developed in the first half of the XIXth century in natural history. In this sociology the logical theme for the classification of organized forms also plays a crucial role.

DT Article
AB An interactionist definition of work as the adjustment between competence and roles is the base of our study on operatic interpretation. The analysis of our empirical material - interviews with the solo singers and published sources - clearly shows a vast process of mutual determination during which a voice is constructed around a particular job and development of an operatic role according to the competence of the artist. This process of adjustment is the result of an operatic posture adopted by the singer during the " production ". The operatic interpretation takes on its different forms as a result of interactions built up between the singer and other members of the - production,: it varies according ro the characteristics and interrelations of the three dimensions - vocal, musical and drama - of the posture, and in relation to the resolution given to the tensions which go through ii.

AB The aim of this article is to report on common conceptions of civil responsibility in the mentality of today. It is based on a representative sample of data for an urban adult population (N = 604. Geneva and Zurich - Switzerland, 1997). Although the global tendency shows a systematic need for protection of the individual, the empirical study also makes apparent four different " philosophies " with each one having its own particular characteristics. Providentialism with a wide freedom of action and a minimum number of obligations, liberalism with both the autonomy of willpower and marked affirmation of individual responsibility, communitarianism where a compromise between the need to protect individuals and a limitation of their freedom by state regulation promoted and interventionism, concerned with order and efficiency, legitimizing both a strict conception of responsibility and a restrictive vision of individual rights. To conclude, the distribution of these different types is examined according to the identity, resources and social origins of those interviewed.

AB Can a sociological theory be made apparent when it is underlying a literary text ? Based on the analysis of three recent works proposing sociological interpretations of A la recherche du temps perdu, the author shows that such an undertaking would have gained from being preceded by some reflection on the literary writing and sociological writing as well as on the aims of Proust. This widening of the preoccupations into research on the writer tin addition to the text) would paradoxically show the interest in taking into account the results of textual analysis with its: stylistic and narratology elements, while not considering the fictional Proust world as a reality, and the text, which allows us to find out about him, as a simple objective report.

AB The aids epidemic has confronted the health systems with problems for which they were badly-prepared, thus explaining the controversy over the role of the State and the public intervention methods. In the European welfare states, only medical treatment could be adequately catered for by the existing institutional structures. Prevention, however, required the development of new structures and approaches, taking into account the lateral coordination of policies, the specific situation of socially underprivileged populations and the border line between what was considered as private and what as public issues. This article analyses how the different health systems in Europe responded to the challenge of the epidemic. It elaborates the national models of institutional change, which emerged with the epidemic but whose objectives reach beyond it to aim at sustainable public health policies.

TI Persistence and reconstruction in the health sector. Local policy to
   combat aids.
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB Aids was a disruptive factor in the health sector. According to a common hypothesis, this disruption gave birth to a new public health policy in France. According to another hypothesis, which this article stands up for, the reconstruction observed gives more weight to the public hospital within the French health system and to the individual curative model on which it is based. To back this hypothesis, local policies to combat aids were studied in six different departments in relation to the institutional matrix in which they fall. An institutional matrix consists of an institutional arrangement within a territory and belonging to a societal sector. In the case of aids this matrix is composed of three poles : health, political and medical-social welfare. Depending on its degree of integration, this matrix defines the form and the content of actions undertaken, both in the prevention and in the taking care of patients. In most cases it manages to reabsorb the disputes resulting from taking medical care of patients and the monopoly of the legitimate expertise of hospital practitioners, by imposing on the different actors involved in combating aids the obligation to adopt institutionalized rules which reproduce dominant legitimate forms in the health sector. The public hospital is all the stronger after this trial, but its modalities of intervention evolve, especially towards prevention and a move towards opening its environment - whereas approaches from, for example, a community model remain marginal or isolated without the capacity to deeply transform the French health sector.

ID RISK ANALYSIS
AB The exceptional mobilization of the developed democracies confronted with aids ended in normalization. The aim of this article is to report, to discriminate between the causes and the consequences of the end of the exceptional status which have been characteristic of the public replies and social reactions towards aids since 1985. Normalization is described and analyzed as the product of a change in the perception of risk. Whereas mobilization indicated a social perception of aids as an unacceptable risk normalization shows acceptability is made possible by the existence of replies, the limited success of treatment and the reduction of uncertainty. Then results a paradoxical decoupling between the perception of risk and the epidemiological reality, with two consequences : one concerning the individual handling of risk through an upsurge in risky behaviour, confirmed by a high level of recent contaminations; the other relating to the public handling of aids through the attempt by those in charge to interpret this social acceptability as a sign indicating the disappearance of the problem.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
AB This article takes a look at the critical period in the development of therapeutic tests on aids, marked by a number of public debates on the ethics and the methodology behind these tests. It shows the polarization of the specialist space (doctors, statisticians) with several testing philosophies. It puts forward the opposition between two generations of doctor and statistician; one, very attached to the public agency and more usually to medical research institutions, oriented towards a controlled design of medical science and clinical practice, the other is engaged more rapidly in aids claiming a new form in the distribution of relationships between science and clinical matters. The article specifies the structural position, in this space, of doctors who criticize globally the codified procedures which at present organize ethics and the scientific character of medical research. It shows what this period reveals about epistemic mutations in our societies and in contemporary medicine.

ID DEMONSTRATIONS; COVERAGE; MEDIA
AB In 1966 the first medicine allowing a real remission of the aids illness appeared : anti-proteinases. Between the moment their effectiveness was declared and the moment when they became available to all patients, only a very insufficient quantity was made available in France. Confronted with this temporary situation of a "tragic choice", the Conseil national du sida (National committee for aids) suggested distributing this medicine by means of a draw. This article is a monographic study of the creating of this situation. of the controversy over the draw, and its consequences. It follows two objectives : 1) it gives a model to analyze the controversies, by studying the link between the work of media and collective action; 2) It illustrates the evolution within the actor network (pharmaceutical firms, clinicians, patients' associations, agencies, authorities) which ensure the arrival of HIV medicine on the French market.
