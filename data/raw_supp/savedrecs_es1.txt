AB The debt crisis that broke out in Greece in 2009 and the conditions accompanying the bail out loans received, led to a dramatic decrease in social spending and social benefits. At the same time the need to curb spending led to major reform initiatives that transformed key aspects of the welfare state, such as the pension and health systems. The paper tries to understand to what extent the changes introduced since the outbreak of the crisis constitute a radical departure from past institutional arrangements. To this end, it examines how the reforms introduced in key welfare institutions, the austerity measures adopted, alongside changes in the labour market and family arrangements have transformed the welfare state. It concludes that while the crisis has indeed triggered the introduction of radical reforms, it is premature to speak of a complete model change.

ID JOB INSECURITY; EMPLOYMENT INSECURITY; WORKERS
AB This paper focuses on current European employment policy, promoting the individual's responsibility for remaining employable. Within this supply-oriented framework, general political responsibilities of both increasing the demand for labour and facilitating the development of human capital through training and education opportunities are less emphasized than the individual's own responsibility to remain attractive for employers. In an analysis of perceived opportunities among European employees, we argue that the concept of 'employment security' can lift the individualized perspective on employability skills and attributes to a more structural and institutional perspective. To enhance individuals' chances of finding a job, educational and lifelong learning policies and active labour market measures are believed to be important factors, besides general demand in the labour market. Through multi-level modelling, we analyse the significance of individual and contextual factors on employees' perception of their chances in the labour market. The data used are from the European Social Survey (2010), including data from 21 countries. Our results indicate that employability cannot solely be regarded as an individual phenomenon relying on individual characteristics. We also need to focus on the institutional context enabling the individual to remain in employment in the existing mobile and risky labour market.

AB Trust links ordinary citizens to the institutions that are intended to represent them, and thereby enhances both the legitimacy and the effectiveness of democratic government. In this article we investigate whether economic performance affects political trust and if the 2007-2008 financial crisis has decreased confidence levels due to the severity of its consequences. We employ multilevel modeling to analyze data from 25 European countries taken from the European Social Survey, combined with economic indicators from the World Bank and the international Monetary Fund. Our results show that economic performance is an important decider of people's levels of trust. We are also able to conclude that the financial crisis has reduced citizen's trust in political institutions in those countries where the crisis has had a severe impact on the economy.

AB Professional football is a highly globalized area. The paper analyses the impact of globalization on football audiences in European countries. It is argued that in the course of globalization, people are not only thrown into a transnational lifestyle, but may also develop a growing interest in what is going on outside their domestic territory. With regard to football, it is hypothesized that audiences may direct more and more attention to high-class football leagues and clubs abroad. This presumed shift of attention is empirically investigated with a new indicator: search engine queries. It is argued that queries addressing football clubs in foreign countries are expressions of transnational attention. These transnational queries are systematically analysed over a period of seven seasons (2005/2006-2011/2012). Results indicate that public attention to foreign football clubs has indeed increased over time, particularly in those countries with weaker domestic football leagues. Furthermore, the fluctuation of attention to these clubs can be explained systematically: attention increases with (a) the success of a club in European and national competitions, (b) the success of domestic players in an expatriate club and (c) the number of matches against domestic clubs in European club competitions. Although transnational attention is generally on the rise, its change over time still seems to depend largely on national identification.

AB Past research suggests that majority evaluations of welfare deservingness are structured along ethnic dividing lines. The fact that poverty and immigrant status are highly associated across Europe's increasingly ethnically diverse societies may thus lead majorities to withdraw support from welfare programs that transfer money to people who are different from themselves. Utilizing measures of general welfarism, most prior studies have not addressed the interplay between attitudes toward immigrants and support for specific welfare types that rely on different notions of entitlement and attract varying levels of take-up among natives and immigrants. Addressing this gap in the literature and focusing on the example of Germany, this paper asks to what extent anti-immigrant sentiment relates to native-born Germans' attitudes toward the government's responsibility to care for three recipient groups: the unemployed, the old, and the sick. Anti-immigrant attitudes expressed as ethnic prejudice are associated with lowered support for government intervention to assist the unemployed, while support for old-age and sickness assistance does not appear to be related to levels of negative out-group sentiment. The results suggest that those who harbor ethnic prejudice are more likely to oppose aid that is predominantly means-tested, rather than universal or contribution-based, and that does benefit a large number of non-natives. The negative association between prejudice and support for unemployment assistance is independent of concerns with the economic viability of the welfare system in the face of immigration. This points to the relevance of negative affect beyond subjectively rational motives.

SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE women's movement; Poland; Czech Republic; transactional activism;
   mobilization
AB This article compares the contemporary Czech and Polish women's movements and demonstrates that there are significant differences in their strategies. While the Polish women's movement is more active in mobilizing the population and uses both transactional and participatory strategies in order to achieve its goals, the Czech women's movement focuses more on transactional activities, such as lobbying, setting up cooperation with national and international organizations, and negotiating with the authorities, as well as on educational activities. The article explains why these differences occur and why during the last decade the Polish women's movement has attempted at mobilizing the population successfully, while the Czech women's movement has not tried to organize any mass mobilizations. Based on interviews with women's organizations in Poland and the Czech Republic, we argue that institutional factors can explain these differences. This includes such factors as the role of the reformed, postcommunist women's organization in each country and the political opportunity structures. The most important political opportunity structures include a law in Poland that force the parliament to debate a law proposal if civil society organizations can get 100,000 signatures, as well as the facility for residents to allocate 1% of their income taxes to a registered civil society organization of their choosing. Another important difference in the political opportunity structures has been the types of institutional arrangements made to accommodate European Union's demands for gender mainstreaming.

AB This paper analyses how unstable employment influences becoming a mother in Italy and Spain. Results suggest that institutional factors foster dynamics of social inequality and hinder family formation. We show that in southern Europe (Italy and Spain), but not in other institutional contexts, the lack of employment stability produces a delay in fertility decision. We attribute this impact of the employment situation on demographic decisions to the sub-protective southern European welfare systems and the insider-outsider labor market configuration, as enhanced by the partial and targeted labor market deregulations of recent decades. In the context of low levels of welfare, unstable employment often comes with persistently reduced entitlement to social and welfare rights, and, therefore, with notable social and demographic consequences. We provide support for this institutional argument by showing that fertility decisions are independent of employment stability in other contexts. Analyses are based on longitudinal data using event history analysis and simultaneous equation models.

AB The paper studies Slovak female elder care workers in Austria. It evaluates the relevance of the care drain metaphor using a representative survey of the carers. It asks two sets of questions: (1) How widespread is the care drain phenomenon? Does migration of elder care workers create care shortages in Slovakia? (2) How do care workers evaluate their employment setting? Is it influenced by experiencing care drain and/or transnational partnering? The higher average age of the care workers means that only a minority has small children in Slovakia. The potential for care drain is therefore limited. Moreover, very few have elderly family members in need of care. On the other hand, most live with partners in Slovakia, so transnational partnering problems could be expected. The average job evaluation of the care workers is highly positive and comparably more enthusiastic than job assessment of women employed in Slovakia. Care workers with small children or partners in Slovakia do not provide a less positive evaluation of the job or its impact on relationships within their families. However, higher earnings and relatively good health of the patient influence the evaluation positively. This focus on earnings and work conditions indicates that care work is probably more similar to other forms of labour migration than anticipated by the current approaches to female migration flows. Indices suggest that these findings could be valid beyond the studied case. A cautious application of the care drain metaphor in intra-EU migration where living standards between countries are not as divergent as between post industrial societies of the West and the Third world is advised.

AB Modernization processes are said to have caused major changes in individual social mobility outcomes. Whether the predictions of the logic of industrialism thesis hold for the careers of women is unclear however. This study provides the first systematic account of how regional modernization processes during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries influenced the careers of the female working population. Unlike research focusing on specific occupational groups and localities, this study models and makes predictions relating to the careers of a random sample of the single female labour force nationwide. We use an excellent source for studying women's careers in different regions and over time. The Historical Sample of The Netherlands provides information about the occupational careers of 1148 single women active on the labour market between 1865 and 1928. To include regional modernization processes, we have collected a set of theoretical indicators, such as communication, transport, and social values, which are measured at the level of municipalities and which may vary yearly. Over historical time, as well as over the course of their careers, the status of women increased. Apart from the emergence of bureaucratic organizations and the expansion of the teaching sector, contextual modernization processes had hardly any influence on women's status. We conclude that the logic of industrialism thesis only partly captures the effect of societal changes on the career success of women. Further research might focus on the role of the emergence of bureaucratic organizations and restrictive practices for the career success of women during modernization.

TI EXPLAINING CROSS-NATIONAL VARIATIONS IN THE INFORMALISATION OF

AB The aim of this paper is to better understand cross-national variations in the informalisation of employment by evaluating critically three contrasting explanations which variously represent informal employment as more prevalent in: poorer under-developed economies (modernisation thesis); societies with high taxes, corruption and state interference in the free market (neo-liberal thesis) and societies with inadequate levels of state intervention to protect workers (political economy thesis). To evaluate these rival explanations, the relationship between the variable informalisation of employment in 10 Central and East European countries, measured using data from a 2007 Eurobarometer cross-national survey involving 5769 face-to-face interviews, and their broader work and welfare regimes are analysed. The finding is that wealthier, less corrupt and more equal societies and those possessing higher levels of taxation, social protection and effective redistribution via social transfers are significantly more likely to have lower levels of informalisation. No evidence is thus found to support the neo-liberal tenets that the informalisation of employment results from high taxes and too much state interference in the free market but evidence is found to positively confirm the modernisation and political economy theses as explanations for the cross-national variations in the informalisation of employment. The paper concludes by discussing the tentative theoretical and policy implications of these findings and calling for further evaluation of their wider validity both longitudinally and across other global regions.

SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES

ID EASTERN; GENDER; EUROPE
AB This paper addresses the main pathways through which households avoid slipping into poverty in Romania by employing a life-course approach. Recent researches on social stratification found that in every country we can delineate a particular social layer composed of households living just above the poverty threshold, whose members struggle to reach a more secure prosperity while facing constant threats of downward mobility. Drawing on recent precarious prosperity research, and based on in-depth interviews carried out in 2013 with 25 households situated in between poverty and prosperity from a Romanian city (Cluj-Napoca), we use a life-course approach in order to account for the main routes into precarious decency of our sampled cases. We found evidence that opportunities for agency in order to overcome precariousness are contingent on household's type, its gender composition and members' interlocking life trajectories. Life-course approach allows us to understand household situation in time perspective and to account for the influence of changing structural context framing individuals' life-course patterns. At the same time, individuals' life courses are increasingly de-standardised within the current post-communist context. The transition from state planned to market economy, coupled with the minimalistic welfare state, and with the low social and institutional trust altering the solidarity of communities are joint factors leading to declining opportunities to rely on other resources than those provided by household members. Interviewed households vary according to their composition, history and assets, further affecting the odds of slipping into poverty. Therefore, our paper raises concerns for policy-makers.

AB This study provides new empirical evidence about tertiary graduates' overeducation, by analysing the influence of labour market institutions on the incidence and distribution of the phenomenon across fields of study. In particular, the analyses focus on the level of employment protection, the regulation of access to the so-called liberal professions, and the propensity of welfare states to hire skilled workers. Data from two comparative surveys - REFLEX and HEGESCO - are used, and a wide set of information is employed to split overeducation in two forms of suboptimal allocation of individuals in the labour market: credential and skill mismatches. The first term refers to the mismatch between formal educational credentials and job requirements, whereas the second term refers to the mismatch between the skills acquired through education and those needed to perform a job. Results suggest that field of study differentials vary by country and that welfare and labour market institutions illuminate these cross-national variations. Moreover, the results support the claim that it is necessary to distinguish between credential and skill mismatches, showing that these institutional factors do not always affect them similarly.

ID POLITICAL-SOCIOLOGY; SOCIAL FIELD; NETWORKS
AB In this paper, we conceptualize EU policy-making as a vital field of professionalization and depict the emergence and various dimensions of an area of professional work nowadays labelled EU Affairs'. Thus, we argue that the EU constitutes more than just a supranational layer of decision-making, but is at the same time a pertinent and influential producer of expert knowledge and sets the stage for the emergence of specialized job profiles, professional careers, and working contexts. While usually acting in the shadow' and in the back doors' of EU policy-making, specialized groups of professionals make use of recognized expert knowledge. Drawing on social field theory and current approaches to professionalism and professionalization, the paper scrutinizes the transnational scope of EU Affairs professionalism in a topological manner by distinguishing different arenas and types of professional involvement in EU Affairs. In this way, we aim to go beyond prevailing bureaucracy- and governance-centred views on EU policy-making, and establish a broader and more differentiated image of the people who actually deal with EU Affairs, ranging from the major locations of EU policy-making far into the EU member states and even beyond.

LA English
DT Article
DE European identity; narratives of Europe; local context
AB This article forms a part of the scientific debate on the change of identities related to the process of European integration. It draws on sociological tools for putting forward the concept of narrative identity' for the analysis of the European sense of belonging. It assumes that the narratives of Europe shared in the transnational networks, which have developed with Europeanization and globalization, contribute to the construction of European identity. It also presumes that the meanings attributed to Europe are shaped by the social context in which people live and are influenced by the local dimension where everyday life takes place. By presenting a qualitative empirical research conducted in two different Italian local contexts, the article highlights the narratives of Europe shared by Europeans from diverse socio-economic and cultural backgrounds, how different stories take shape and what types of European identity they contribute to construct. Results show that the narratives of Europe are multi-level stories, a mixture of values and references coming from local cultural heritages and national history, and linked to the European post-national plot. Both subjective autonomy and structural social conditioning influence the conceptualization of Europe and European identity is embedded in local territories. The dynamics of identity formation and the openness toward Europe in local identities are connected to the habitus' and related to variables such as education, socio-economic background, media exposure, transnational networking, participation and experiencing Europe.

DE associations; nations; sociology; Europe
AB This report presents the results of a survey on the National Associations of Sociology in Europe conducted in the years 2012-2013 by the European Sociological Association (ESA) under the auspices of its Committee for National Associations. The National Associations of Sociology were progressively established and institutionalized throughout the twentieth century, each one reflecting the political circumstances of the European Continent at the time. Of the 40 associations surveyed, 10% were in existence in 1950, which shows that the consolidation of the associative movement of sociologists in Europe is generally quite recent and gradually built up over the course of a century or more. The size of each association in terms of numbers of members is a key dimension in understanding how sociology is organized throughout Europe. The same may be said of the difficulties encountered when establishing the ESA as recently as 1992. The results of the survey show that the European sociological community is the aggregate of several parallel currents going back well over a hundred years. Each current has generated as many tributaries as there are individual academic and professional corporations operating in the dozens of countries where sociology has been able to take root and develop, whilst favoured - or sometimes opposed - by university and social policies, governments and public or private bodies. Moreover, each country has its own story to tell about the particular claims and losses, its ups and downs, advances and set-backs that sociology as a discipline has experienced.

AB The article focuses on citizens' predispositions for democracy and discusses the concepts of democratic mentality, demos, and demoi. Democratic mentality was operationalized by attitudes, values, and behavioral tendencies which promote civility and civic political culture. Theoretical analysis is followed by an empirical assessment of diverse intranational and international mentalities: prodemocratic, antidemocratic, and nondemocratic tendencies. Constellations of attitudes were explored by secondary data analysis of European Values Study (EVS wave 4, 2008-2010 period, 44 countries, 73 questionnaire items). Individual citizens (N = 63,281) were classified by k-means cluster analysis into: (1) 'secular democrats', (2) 'religious democrats', (3) 'nondemocratic skeptics', (4) 'antidemocratic intolerant economically deprived traditionalists', and (5) 'antidemocratic religious radicals'. All mentalities occurred in each country; countries differed by the incidence of democratic (1 + 2), nondemocratic (3), and antidemocratic (4 + 5) mentalities. Democratic mentality was prevalent in the Northwest (especially in Scandinavia) and among elites; its average incidence in Europe was 40.9%. The results manifested trans-nationally shared political mentalities of European citizens, indicated that democrats were significantly present in every country, and confirmed presence of a robust demos in the North-Western Europe. International democratic mentality (trans-national demos) can be viewed as a possible source of democratic peace (Pax democratica). Civility was an important component of democratic mentality. It was demonstrated that democracy can function without prevalent active political participation but it is hard to conceive democracy without widespread civility. Whenever democracy is being exported or restored, the process must primarily focus on civility and not be limited to mere cultivation of political culture.

AB A sequel to an analysis of citizens' predispositions for democracy (Part I), this study focuses on larger units, shared ideologies. European ideologies were explored by secondary data analysis of European Values Study (EVS) wave 4, years 2008-2010, 44 countries, 73 questionnaire items, N = 63,281 respondents. The nature of the ideologies is inviting to cluster analysis approach as they tend to be described in terms of patterned clusters' and likened to an urban cacophony. We applied cluster analysis to reveal prevalent ideological patterns (pro- and antidemocratic tendencies) within the noise of attitudes, values, and behavioral tendencies of European voters and nonvoters. This time our unit was not an individual citizen but a more general unit, an averaged electoral case'. Each major party and also 'no party', other party', and DK/NA' categories for each country were represented by an abstracted (non)voter with average opinions (using all 73 variables), producing N = 302 averaged electoral tendencies. These were subjected to hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis. Resulting clusters partitioned Europe into three political regions: active democracy (the north-west; 41% of Europeans, 64.5% democratic), moderate democracy (southern and postcommunist Europe; 48% of Europeans, 21.7% democratic), passive democracy (south-east: Turkey, Romania, Albania, Northern Cyprus; 11% of Europeans, 9.6% democratic). This study thus provided a complementary perspective to the study from Part I (which manifested trans-nationally shared political mentalities of European citizens): European public ideologies manifested regional divides and confirmed the lack of internationally shared public sphere.

AB This article examines social attitudes towards social rights in Portugal. It utilizes original survey data from 2013 to study the distribution of welfare attitudes in a context of economic austerity and welfare retrenchment. The main argument is that there are at least two sources of preference formation regarding public social provision: one is universalistic (or needs-based), and the other is contributory. These two logics frame choices concerning the future of the welfare state in Portugal. We explore the determinants of this choice through three hypotheses: dualization between insiders and outsiders (H1), the type of welfare regime (H2) and social rights consciousness (H3). Our findings suggest that choice between universalistic and contributory models is not impervious to macro-institutional factors and labour market performance. The paper's main contribution, however, is to empirically demonstrate that this choice is significantly shaped by pre-existing understandings of social rights in Portugal, namely its politically contested character.

AB The enlargement of the European Union (EU) and the subsequent global economic recession has drawn attention to individual-level attitudes towards immigrants across Europe. In this context, using the European Social Survey (ESS), we compared Irish attitudes towards immigrants with those in 12 other European countries at 3 critical moments in time - prior to large immigration flows in 2002; at the height of the economic boom in 2006; and after the global financial crash in 2008. Our descriptive analysis examines whether significant changes in attitudes towards immigrants has occurred in the EU as a whole and within individual countries over time. We predicted that fluctuations in economic condition such as the rise in unemployment would affect attitudes towards immigrants. This relationship receives some support from our findings. In Ireland, positive attitudes to immigrants between 2006 and 2010 decreased and negative attitudes increased, on all attitudinal measures, more sharply than in any of the other European countries. Taking the 12 countries as a whole, attitudes have tended to polarise particularly with regard to allowing access to immigrants and their impact on the economy. This research reveals worrying trends in attitudes to immigrants in European countries, particularly in light of the importance of immigrants to the European labour market, both currently and in the future.

AB Attitudes towards intergroup dating and their determinants are important to comprehend group boundaries of multicultural societies. Our contribution investigates gender and ethnic differences in intergroup dating approval among 18 year olds from 11 ethnic groups in Belgium. We observe ethnic differences in the level of approval of intergroup dating. However, these ethnic disparities are largely explained by the degree of sexual liberalization, parental control and religiosity. Moreover, the associations of parental control, sexual liberalization and religiosity with attitudes towards intergroup dating differ for girls and boys. We conclude by highlighting the relevance of the interaction of gender and ethnic origin in shaping attitudes towards intergroup dating.

AB The labor milieu of merchant seamen is an environment which may be treated as a laboratory to analyze the processes ongoing in contemporary organizations. In this article authors concentrate on two main problems concerning interpersonal relations in a ship in the context of trust: the intercultural communication and the issue of diversity based on other qualities. Today's management practices aimed at economization of work at sea result in the fact that many of deep-sea vessels' crews are multinational teams. Long-term isolation of vessels' crews means good conditions for research on the influence of multiculturalism on interpersonal relations as well as for the level and sort of trust between seamen. The authors make attempt to prove that there is no simple and positive relation between the lack of cultural differences (understanding of others) and the level of trust. On the basis of their qualitative and quantitative research on people working at sea the authors also try to specify the tolerance of seamen toward the others. The diversity dimensions such as age, gender, religion/denomination and sexual orientations are used to describe multiculturalism in categories of acceptance and rejection. In the research presented in the article the authors have used the auditorium questionnaire (n = 224) and 20 in-depth individual interviews with seamen.

ID WOMENS EMPLOYMENT; DIVISION
AB Despite substantial country variation in gender-role attitudes and female labor supply and theoretical arguments stressing the consequences of contextual attitudes for individual behavior, prior research did not find evidence for an effect of a country's gender-role attitudes on female labor supply. In this study I reassess this finding using a powerful multilevel design on the 2008 wave of the European Values Study on 33 countries. I find a substantial positive and independent effect of a country's egalitarian gender-role attitudes on individual women's odds of labor market attachment. The original, gross effect can for one-fourth be attributed to an effect of individual gender-role attitudes and one-tenth to an institutional effect. These findings indicate that the cultural (attitude) context matters for female labor supply.

AB This article investigates the relationship between the 'gender informal care gap' - the relative contributions of women to informal care for non-co-resident relatives and other members of social networks, compared to men - and public care policies, level of care needs, labour market position and gendered care attitudes. Since the literature suggests that none of these factors alone can explain the gender informal care gap, we develop a model based on fuzzy-set/qualitative comparative analysis in order to identify patterns in the relationship between the factors. The analysis conducted at the macro-national level in 13 European countries, suggests that at the macro-level, the availability of public care services is crucial to understanding the gender informal care gap, while women's labour market position, the presence or absence of gendered care attitudes and the level of care needs play no or a relatively minor role.

AB The purpose of this paper is to explore whether the returns to attending a prestigious higher education institution have increased in Norway for students who graduated in 1975 to students who graduated in 1999. A handful of published studies find that the returns to attending prestigious institutions have increased in the last decades. However, they all study the USA, which has a decentralized wage bargaining system. The results in this paper shed light on whether a centralized wage bargaining system, typical for many west-European countries, prevents the returns to attending prestigious institutions from increasing. I find that attending prestigious institutions pays off economically in Norway and that the returns have increased throughout the investigated period. Another aim of this paper is to investigate whether the returns have increased more at the top of the earnings distribution than at the bottom. I find that the returns are highest at the top of the earnings distribution and have increased the most at the top. At the 90th quantile, for instance, students who attended a prestigious business school between 1975 and 1979 obtained 80% higher earnings than students attending nonprestigious institutions in the same period. Among students who graduate 20 years later, this difference is 139%.

AB Using the Eurobarometer cross-sectional data sets conducted between 1976 and 2008 in nine European countries, we aim to describe and explain cohort differences. We make use of recent improvements of the age-period-cohort (APC) methodology to have a better assessment of these cohort-based changes. At first, we find strong and significant cohort fluctuations in participation in political discussion where the people born in the period 1945-1955 have an almost systematically higher participation than previous and following cohorts. The introduction of individual level variables such as education does not explain the cohort bump of the early baby boomers. Post-APC estimations show that the contextual factors size of a birth cohort and economic affluence at the entry into adulthood are important explanatory factors for cohort differences. In conclusion, since strong cohort effects are detected in the APC model, the decline in participation of the young appears to be less a temporary moratorium that will vanish with age but a durable trait without redeem.

AB This study analyses differences in individual-level working poverty determinants between Germany and the UK. These differences are linked to institutional patterns at the country level. Here, we observe that the two countries differ especially in bargaining centralisation, employment protection legislation and family policy. At the same time, the levels of decommodification and labour market regulation are no longer core differences in the institutional settings of Germany and the UK, which is interpreted as a consequence of Germany's departure from a traditional conservative regime since the mid-1990s. Adopting economic and sociological approaches, we explain how Germany's closed employment system channels the effects of deregulation policies to the periphery of the labour market. Additionally, we argue that open employment relationships that dominate in the UK put specifically older employees at risk. Finally, we identify country-specific differences in the economic dependency of women, resulting from a stronger male breadwinner orientation of family policy in Germany. Accordingly, multivariate analyses based on harmonised versions of the British Household Panel Study (2002-2005) and the Socio-Economic Panel Study (2003-2006) reveal that entrants and re-entrants to the labour market, women and - unexpectedly - low-educated persons are particularly affected by in-work poverty in Germany; whereas older workers are more likely to face precarious economic conditions in the UK.

AB This study considered trends in the intergenerational transmission of social assistance (SA) among young adults in Finland, Norway and Sweden during the 2000s. Comparable administrative register data-sets enabled us to compare year by year the social assistance recipiency of 20-year-old adults in the period 1999-2008, together with information on their parents' social assistance recipiency at the time when those young adults were aged 16 years. The intergenerational odds-ratio for SA was stronger in Sweden than in Finland or Norway. The probabilities of transitioning into SA when having an SA family background have declined in all three countries, but less than the transition probabilities into SA when from a non-SA family. This has strengthened the intergenerational odds-ratio in all three countries, though only slightly in Norway. The upwards trend in intergenerational odds-ratios for SA follows almost perfectly the declining trend in the number of 20-year-old recipients in these three countries. When the number of SA recipients decrease, it decreases the transition probabilities into SA more among those with a non-SA family background compared to the those with an SA family background. This difference in the decrease of transition probabilities turns into an increase in the intergenerational odds-ratio.

AB Little research has been conducted into the way citizens explain educational outcomes today. This is remarkable because scholars have always claimed that education as an institution contributes to a representation of society in which success is 'achieved' on strictly meritocratic grounds. This paper attempts to fill this gap by examining public opinion on three explanations for educational success and failure - namely talent, effort and social background - in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium). Survey data (N = 1693) revealed that people are much more inclined to attribute educational success to effort and dedication when compared to educational failure. Contrary to the expectations derived from the literature on symbolic capital, 'talent' was not deemed very important by our respondents as an explanation for educational outcomes. In addition, higher educated people supported an explanation for school success or failure in terms of social background more than the less educated. The implications of our findings are discussed.

AB In research on pensions and retirement income, it has been frequently reasoned that the economic situation in later life is determined by an interplay of individual and institutional factors. However, previous studies in this field either focus only on individual determinants or on macro-level outcomes using aggregated data. We apply a multilevel approach to examine the impact of institutional factors on the link of individual pension income and previous employment history. The underlying research question is of how national pension systems shape this relationship; whether flexible careers and atypical employment are compensated for or, on the contrary, 'penalised' with a low pension income. We combine the life-history data of individuals in 13 European countries from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARELIFE) with macro-data on national pension systems. While we find little cross-national variation for men, for women the strength of the relationship of employment history and pension income differs between countries and is significantly moderated by factors related to the pension system.

AB In the last few years, much sociological debate has focused on individualisation theory, especially on Beck's risk society version. According to this theory, contemporary social change can be interpreted as the progressive weakening of the influence of social structures on individual behaviour. Individualisation theory has been adopted in many fields of study (voting behaviour, consumption behaviour, etc.). Although much of the debate has a theoretical character, there have been some attempts to empirically assess individualisation theory. As far as poverty is concerned, scholars supporting individualisation theory, as well as scholars opposing it, have adopted one of the following methodological strategies: highlighting the role played by individual variables (especially by life course variables) rather than structural variables; controlling for individual rather than structural variables. Both these approaches focus on short observation windows; however, it is necessary to consider long periods in order to assess the core of individualisation theory, i.e. the decreasing influence of social structures. Our approach assesses the change (rather than the stability) of the individual-level relationship between structures (occupational classes, education, etc.) and poverty over a long time period. This changing-parameter model is implemented through multilevel modelling with families at level one and years at level two. The analysis focuses on the Italian case and it is based on data from the Family Expenditure Survey (Indagine sui Consumi delle Famiglie) that was collected by the Italian Statistical Institute (ISTAT). It covers the period from 1985 to 2011. The results seem to indicate that there is stability in the relationship between structures and poverty.

AB The aim of this paper is to analyse the impact of social origin on the transition from basic to secondary education and from secondary to tertiary education, comparing four cohorts born between 1935 and 1984. The analysis focuses on testing four hypotheses, which are mainly derived from the theses of maximally maintained inequality, effectively maintained inequality and the changes in the Estonian education system. The analysis is based on data from the Estonian Social Survey, 2004-2005, which gathered retrospective information about the educational transitions of respondents and their social origins. The findings showed the persistent inequality in the transition to secondary education during the socialist period, despite the expansion of secondary education in the 1960s and 1970s. However, as a result of declining enrolments in the 1990s, social inequality in the transition probabilities to secondary education increased significantly. We found that social origin had a strong impact on the transition to higher education, but surprisingly this effect did not change when comparing cohorts. We can also point out that the distribution of educational opportunity is related more to the rules that govern educational selection than to the expansion of the educational system per se.

AB In this article, we examine how European patients' organizations (EPOs) contribute to moving patient advocacy beyond national level organizing and acting. In contrast to Europeanization studies, our contention is that EPOs are not content merely to bring national claims up to the European level nor simply enrich national debates with European issues. Rather, we argue that EPOs engage in a compounded multilevel construction of patients as 'European individuals' and of their conditions as matters of concern for Europe. Based on an analysis of the projects, pronouncements, and politics of three EPOs - European Organization on Rare Diseases, Alzheimer Europe, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Europe - we explore how they form European communities of patients and give shape to health issues they deem important to address at European level. We show that EPOs' involvement in the ongoing construction of Europe relies on their capacities to collect, format, and circulate comparative facts, figures, and data on the functioning of domestic health systems, drawn notably on their members' experiences. This helps them to raise discussions on the need for European health-care policies which articulate a 'Europe of markets' and a 'social Europe' to the benefit of the patients. We discuss the form of politics that this EPOs' 'evidence-based activism', as we call it, entails, and conclude with a few thoughts on their influence on the making of European health-care policies.

TI The Myth of 'Three Italies': Differences and Similarities in
   Environmental Values Between Macro-Regions
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Correction
DE Italy; macro-regions; environmental values; NEP
AB One of the most frequently perceived divisions in Italy is that of a substantial cultural discrepancy in the environmental values of the North, the Centre and the South. The recent and prolonged waste crisis in Southern Italy reinforced this common public discourse. There are, however, no recent studies that have explored these alleged differences. This study aims to fill this hiatus by analysing differences across macro-regions in terms of the endorsement of basic environmental values. Differences in environmental values are examined using the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale with a multi-level variance components analysis. The findings suggest that whilst dissimilarities between macro-regions do exist, they are not in fact as significant as might be expected, thus indicating the existence of a national cultural homogeneity in terms of 'primitive' beliefs towards nature and humanity's relationship with it. The findings also highlight the problems of 'Ecological Fallacy' and underscore the complexity of the relationship between values and behaviour.

ID EUROPEANIZATION; POLICY; EUROPE; SOCIETY
AB The aim of this paper is to analyse the impact of social origin on the transition from basic to secondary education and from secondary to tertiary education, comparing four cohorts born between 1935 and 1984. The analysis focuses on testing four hypotheses, which are mainly derived from the theses of maximally maintained inequality, effectively maintained inequality and the changes in the Estonian education system. The analysis is based on data from the Estonian Social Survey, 2004-2005, which gathered retrospective information about the educational transitions of respondents and their social origins. The findings showed the persistent inequality in the transition to secondary education during the socialist period, despite the expansion of secondary education in the 1960s and 1970s. However, as a result of declining enrolments in the 1990s, social inequality in the transition probabilities to secondary education increased significantly. We found that social origin had a strong impact on the transition to higher education, but surprisingly this effect did not change when comparing cohorts. We can also point out that the distribution of educational opportunity is related more to the rules that govern educational selection than to the expansion of the educational system per se.

AB This paper proposes a methodology for using survey data to understand the composition of elites, through analysing the pool of potential members. An occupational-based measure of 'potential power elite' (PPE) is created and compared with other measures of occupational advantage. It is argued that this measure can be utilised to explore if the processes causing certain social groups to be under-represented in elite positions are around selection or the population recruited from. We provide analysis of elite positions in the UK and Sweden, demonstrating differences in terms of the potential pool of elite members and the occupational histories of people of those employed in roles associated with elite recruitment. We argue that understanding the composition of the PPE provides a more nuanced analysis of the processes of meritocracy in accessing positions of power and social influence.

AB Measuring individual transitions means capturing a process with a specific time dimension. The established analysis of school-to-work transitions focuses on single status changes, such as those between education and unemployment. As longitudinal datasets became increasingly available, the periodical character of transitions has deserved attention, mostly in terms of studies that used event history models. But even these kinds of studies continued to focus on single status changes, which are not determined by theory but by the respective research question, or by data availability. Hence, the analysis of micro-level transitions remains selective, because there is no common idea how to explore them. As a result, school-to-work transition research is in danger to overlook important aspects of this life-course trajectory. This paper argues that the reason is the missing theoretical definition of a transition. Given the growing complexity of school-to-work transitions, the status change concept becomes inappropriate for their analysis. The predominance of hypothesis-testing methods together with an underrepresentation of explorative methods lead to a disregard of the process character of school-to-work transitions. This considerably limits the gain of new scientific insights. Recent methodological developments regarding the explorative analysis of longitudinal processes, namely sequence analysis, offer the possibility to cope with the complexity of school-to-work transitions. The paper aims at comparing the advantages and drawbacks of two methods in analysing transitions, and advocates a combined research design between explorative and hypothesis-testing methods.

AB Previous research indicates that social relationships can influence the probability of successfully finding a first job. This paper contributes to this field of research by empirically analysing the rarely studied question, if social networks can help adolescents find an apprenticeship in the strongly company-based vocational training system of Germany. In contrast to most previous studies, not only the youth's networks, but also their mothers' networks are taken into account. In addition to the social, the ethnic composition of the networks is also considered. Event data analyses of German panel data on natives and migrants from the project 'Young Immigrants in the German and Israeli Educational System' show that adolescents' networks have no effect on the success of an apprenticeship search. In contrast, the mothers' networks play a crucial role.

AB This study seeks to find the reasons for the rising risk of unemployment for people who have completed basic vocational education and training (VET) in Switzerland. We focus on the long-term structural shift on the demand side of the labour market and its consequences for new entrants' chances of employment in the labour force. A detailed analysis of the development of vacancies for such 'career entrants' in the time period 2001 to 2011 suggests that neither a growing occupational mismatch nor a general shift in the level of education to the disadvantage of workers with vocational education can be made responsible for the rising unemployment of labour market entrants. Instead, the available evidence indicates that a diminishing part of the vacancies suited for VET graduates remains open to entrants because of the increasing job requirements with regard to work experience and further education. Basic vocational education and training alone is increasingly less a guarantee for a smooth entry into the working world.

AB In the search for an explanation of wage inequalities between men and women, it is often argued that women's disadvantages on the labour market are the result of their lower investment in human capital. However, this argument loses for at a time when highly educated women are outperforming men in terms of educational attainment. But even within the group of higher education graduates, gender differences remain in the form of gender-typical enrolment in academic subjects. The present article analyses the wage effects of how graduation in typically female subjects and subsequent work in typically female occupations generate wage inequalities 1 and 5 years after graduation. For understanding these effects, it follows the hypothesis of a socio-cultural devaluation of female-dominated subjects and occupations. Based on the 1997 HIS Absolventenpanel, we estimate gross hourly wages of male and female higher education graduates as they enter the German labour market. Results show that, 1 year after graduation, men receive a higher wage penalty than women for graduating in a female-dominated subject. However, working in typically female occupations affects women's wages more strongly than it does men's immediately after graduation. In addition, women have fewer possibilities to compensate for this penalty in subsequent years.

AB In this paper, we use panel data from the UK and Germany to investigate the effect of employer changes and in-firm job changes on year-to-year wage mobility of male full-time workers. Following segmentation theories and the job search theory, we study whether this effect differs for the low- and high-wage workers. As wage growth is endogenous to the decision of changing jobs, a two-stage Heckman selection approach is used. Specifically, we first estimate a random-effects multinomial logit model for the selection into a job transition and then a fixed-effects panel regression model for the wage growth. The findings suggest that both external and in-firm job changes result into substantial wage gains for the low-paid workers but not for the medium- or high-paid workers. However, the wage gain of low-paid workers due to an in-firm job change is only observed in the UK and is less pronounced than their gain by an external job change. In the German labour market, the later effect is insignificant. The results indicate that low-paid workers profit more from a voluntary change of employer in the coordinated German labour market and from a voluntary in-firm change in the liberal British labour market.

AB In the 1980s and 1990s the study of education-work transitions took a comparative turn. Researchers sought to identify national differences in transition processes and outcomes and explain them in terms of institutional characteristics of national 'transition systems'. This was an ambitious aim because it required the study of transitions to develop as a field of 'macro' social-science research, while continuing also to use theories, techniques of analysis and data associated with 'micro' research. This paper reviews the progress of transition-system research over the past 20 years. It describes the development of the research field and how it has been shaped by its theoretical origins, the political context, the availability of data and the organisation of research. The research has made significant if uneven progress towards explaining national differences in transitions; its achievements appear more significant when viewed from a perspective which emphasises the case-oriented rather than variables-oriented aims of comparative research.

AB Young people in Europe face great difficulties nowadays when entering the labour market. Unemployment and temporary employment are high among youth, although considerable differences exist between European countries. In this article, we study to what extent cyclical, structural, and institutional factors explain cross-national variation in youth labour market integration. In addition, we examine educational differences in the impact of these macro-characteristics. To answer these questions, we use data on young people from 29 countries who were interviewed in the European Social Survey of 2002, 2004, 2006, or 2008 and left day-time education in the period 1992-2008. Both unemployment and temporary employment are regarded as a lack of labour market integration, compared to the situation of permanent employment. The empirical results first of all show that high unemployment hinders young people to smoothly integrate into the labour market. In addition, economic globalisation positively affects youth labour market integration. We also demonstrate that young people experience less difficulties with labour market integration as the educational system is more vocationally specific. Intermediate and higher educated particularly profit from the positive effect of the vocational specificity of the educational system. Finally, as the employment protection legislation of incumbent workers is stricter, young people experience more difficulties with labour market integration, especially higher educated youth.

AB Given the importance of trust and confidence for the individual consumer's well-being and societies' overall consumer conditions, this paper intends to conceptualize, investigate and map European consumer markets' trust regimes. Based on statistics from DG Sanco's Consumer Condition Scoreboard 2012, trust dimensions in 29 European countries (EU27 + Norway and Iceland) are reanalyzed and compared. The material reveals large differences in consumer markets' trust regime levels across Europe. This paper suggests that one way people evaluate consumer market institutions, is by their perceptions of food and product safety. The concluding discussion gives attention to possible discrepancies between consumer markets' trust regimes and consumer institutions' trustworthiness.

ID ETHNIC DIVERSITY; NETWORKS; EUROPE
AB The article investigates to what extent the presence of immigrants in urban environments is reflected in the personal social interactions of their residents. Starting from the assumption that social interactions are complex products of contextual conditions, individual characteristics and personal preferences, we examine potentially varying effects of the presence of immigrants in a neighbourhood and city on different forms of social interaction, i.e., on neighbourhood contacts as well as on weak and strong ties. The article contributes to the literatures on social interactions and on consequences of immigration. The analysis is based on a unique data set for a random sample of German urban neighbourhoods. We can show that, in German cities, interaction between the long-term residents and those of immigrant background is frequent and common - in the neighbourhoods and in the social networks more generally. However, evidence regarding the impact of the neighbourhood as opportunity context for encounters and ensuing closer interactions is mixed. While a higher immigration-related diversity of the residential environment increases the frequency of inter-group contact in these environments, effects of differing opportunities for interaction in the residential environment on network ties could not be demonstrated. We suggest that this may be explained by a possibly limited importance of neighbourhood, as compared with other social contexts, and by the relative recency of immigration.

AB Welfare states and social security institutions are positioned at a nexus of the two principles self-responsibility and solidarity resulting in higher or lower social inequality. Despite historical and national particularities, it is possible to identify common tendencies in their relational developments in Europe. Here, four of them will be analysed. The analysis of these cross-national developments results in the observation that self-responsibility and solidarity are being redefined and have ultimately grown together into a strict circular logic of interdependency. This, however, assumes very different forms of self-responsibility and solidarity and thereby a different concept and nexus of both principles than was the case some 20 years ago. Dominant discourses based on dualistic concepts are much too limited to comprehend this complex nexus. Instead, the changed institutions of social security implement institutional norms that correspond to a broad concept of interdependency.

AB Claims of the demise of class were in part fuelled by problems facing a class analysis of contemporary politics. Central to this was the emergence of the 'new middle class'. Debates revolved around whether it would constitute a source of radicalism or conservatism. John Goldthorpe's concept of the service class has proven to be the most enduring contribution to these debates. The service class, Goldthorpe held, would constitute an essentially conservative element in contemporary society. Deviations from this expected conservatism were supposedly an intermittent, transitory phenomenon, devoid of structural basis. In this paper, I investigate the political attitudes of the Norwegian service class. Adhering to Clark and Lipset's insistence on the need for a more complex analysis of both class and politics, I take a multidimensional approach: political attitudes are seen within the two dimensions of economic and 'post-materialist' issues, and class divisions in terms of the two dimensions of volume and composition of capital, following Bourdieu. By applying Multiple Correspondence Analysis, I uncover a significant political heterogeneity with a structural basis in the different forms of capital, pace Goldthorpe. The fractions relying on cultural capital are markedly leftist, while their counterparts possessing economic capital constitute a right-wing. Also, service-class members with the most capital are more liberal than their counterparts with less overall capital. I argue that this points to the significance of a multidimensional concept of class, which in turn necessitates further work on how 'Bourdieusian' concepts can be synthesised with class analysis.

LA English
DT Article
DE social capital; social resources; voluntary associations
ID PARTICIPATION; NETWORKS; GENERATOR; EUROPE
AB Associations are likely to recruit resource rich individuals and they are places where individuals interact, and thus, are likely to exchange social resources. The paper asks which kinds of associations embed individuals holding many social resources. According to theoretical considerations, I distinguish between bridging and bonding associations. Bridging associations are likely to embed heterogeneous individuals while bonding associations embed homogeneous individuals. Therefore, the range of social resources available inside associations may be higher in bridging than in bonding associations. Thinking about the resource exchanging environment inside the associations, a further distinction of bonding associations seems reasonable: some aim at political goals outside the group (e. g., trade unions or professional organizations) and others focus on developing a nice atmosphere inside the group (apolitical bonding associations like elderly leisure associations). I analyze data from Eurobarometer 62.2 using multilevel analyses. Descriptive analyses indicate that active individuals have access to more social resources than inactive individuals. This relation varies for apolitical and political bonding associations according to the European countries. The multilevel analyses controlling for individual characteristics and country variables indicate that potential resources accessible to individuals active in associations depend on the focus of the associations. While bridging and apolitical bonding associations embed individuals accessing more social resources than non-active individuals, political bonding associations are not likely to embed resource rich individuals.

ID NETHERLANDS
AB In this contribution we deal with the contradiction between changing culture and stable structure, i.e., the phenomenon that a social structure that developed to accommodate a certain culture may remain stable over a long period of time, even when that culture changes. We do so for the case of the Dutch public broadcasting system, that was designed in the 1920s to fit with the segmented pluralism of Dutch society, in which a number of religiously and ideologically different groups had to peacefully co-exist. In the mid-1960s, Dutch society started to change rapidly and segmented pluralism started to wane. The public broadcasting system, however, hardly changed until today. First we explain how structure and culture initially matched and how the concept of path dependency can explain how over time culture and structure can grow apart. Then, with data of six national surveys between 1979 and 2005, we explore the possible cultural grounds for the fact that the segmented public broadcasting system has outlived the segmented pluralism of Dutch society that it was originally designed to match.

AB The reaction of citizens deeply disappointed with their government and its decisions differs from country to country, and in some cases, such as Latvia during the recent economic crisis, has been surprisingly passive. In this paper I argue that political passivity can be partly explained by psychological mechanisms triggered by constant under-performance and unresponsiveness of political authorities. Using International Social Survey Program 2006-2007 data, I construct a structural equation model which shows that government's performance can facilitate or hinder the development of civil society through its impact on (1) a sense of political efficacy, (2) political competence, and (3) interpersonal trust. Poor institutional performance and the following loss of trust in political authorities has a negative effect on people's perceptions of politics, of themselves and of each other, discouraging further engagement in all kinds of political activities. Considering the importance of civic participation for the quality of governance this creates a vicious circle which might not be easy to break. Finally, several theoretical perspectives are discussed that help to explain the formation and persistence of the vicious circle.

AB European Secularism, one of the many versions of secularism available in the world, was developed in the context predominantly of single-religion societies, after a great deal of religious homogenization had already taken place. It was and remains a modest secularism. However, with the migration of workers from former colonies and the intensification of globalization, pre-Christian (Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain) and post-Christian faiths (Islam and Sikhism) have been thrown together for the first time in modern Europe creating an unprecedented diversity the like of which has not been witnessed in Europe under conditions of modernity. This has destabilized European secular states and the conception of secularism that underpins them. European Secularism is in crisis for as it now turns out it is not quite secular enough.

AB Research on European trade unionism has discussed whether the tendency towards 'union diplomacy' has meant that that unions are largely disinterested in mobilizing members and pursue contentious action at the European level. Other studies have identified activities that suggest an Europeanization of political mobilization, in demonstrations and strikes and in cooperation with NGOs and social movements. The present paper analyzes attitudes towards transnational action among trade unions in Europe, as well as the degree to which national unions actually partake in more and less contentious action. The study, which is based on a survey to trade unions in Europe carried out in 2010-11 (n 250), focuses particularly on the production of joint statements and petitions, demonstrations and boycotts, and strikes. The aim was to identify the similarities and differences between industrial relations regimes and sectors in Europe and the analyses have revealed that there are in fact significant differences. Trade unions in the continental social partnership regime and the southern polarized/state centered regime tend to approve of and partake in European demonstrations and boycotts to a higher degree than unions in the other regimes, while the Nordic unions in the organized corporatist regime tend to be more skeptical and also participate to a lower degree. In addition, unions in services and organizing professionals tend to partake and approve of such action to a lower degree than unions in other sectors and national peak level unions.

TI THE EU'S EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT HERITAGE POLITICS

ID MEMORY POLITICS
AB During the past couple of decades, heritage has become topical in a new way in Europe as the concept has been utilized for political purposes in the EU cultural policy. The EU currently administrates or supports three initiatives - the European Heritage Days, the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage, and the European Heritage Label - that address the fostering of the transnational European cultural heritage. The article discusses the explicit and implicit heritage politics included in these initiatives. In order to understand the constructive and generative nature of the EU heritage politics, it is approached in the article as a discursive meaning-making process consisting of several political aims, the strategies for obtaining them, and the underlying ideologies on which the aims and the strategies are based upon. The main focuses of the EU's heritage politics are determined in the article as: the politics of integration, image-building, education, governmentality, and the economy. The fundamental strategy in the implementation of the EU heritage politics is to mingle the top-down and bottom-up dynamics between the EU and the local agents. This is at the same time its ideological core: to produce seemingly self-creating and self-maintaining coherency and cultural integration in the EU.

AB The aim of the paper is to investigate the consequences of the expansion of higher education on two goals of the education system, namely promoting equity of educational opportunities and providing credentials that facilitate the matching of labour supply and demand. The first goal is typically studied by research on inequality of educational opportunity; the second by research on returns to education and credential inflation. The key idea of the paper is that educational expansion can have different and possibly opposite effects on the two goals. (a) If, with educational expansion, equality of educational opportunities increases, while the occupational value of the titles decreases, one has a trade-off scenario. For example, an increase in equality of educational opportunities is matched by a decline in the value of higher education in the labour market. (b) If equality of opportunities does not increase, despite the expansion of higher education, and the returns of higher education degrees decline, one has then a worst-off scenario. (c) Finally, if with educational expansion equality of opportunities increases and there is no credential inflation, one has a best-off scenario. In this paper, we systematically investigate these alternative scenarios. We perform the same empirical analysis on two distinct data sets in order to test the robustness of our findings. We use micro data from EU-SILC 2005 and from the five merged waves of the European Social Survey (2002-2010), covering 23 countries.

AB The objective of this study is to identify and describe the existing ideals regarding marriage or long-term coupling in Europe during the first decade of the twenty-first century and to measure their prevalence in the population. To obtain this broad picture we have developed a typology of marriages based on data from the 2008-2010 European Values Study and inspired by Louis Roussel's models. Two criteria have been used to classify evaluative opinions on marriage and construct the ideal types: the nature and function of the bond between partners. The first criterion, the nature of the relationship, differentiates those who favour an Alliance model (42.2% of Europeans), a Fusion model (38.1%) and an Association model (19.5%). In turn, within each ideal type, marriage can be conceived as being necessary or contingent. Combining both criterion results in a typology of six ideal types representing a broad spectrum; at the extremes we find the apparently outdated Institutional marriage supported by 27.8% of the population and an emerging ideal known as the Pure-relationship, supported by 8.4% of Europeans.

AB This article contributes to understanding the relatively early residential independence of young Northern Europeans, by comparison to their Southern European peers. It explores the norms and underlying meanings that influence the departure from the parental home and the feelings attached to it. Analysing qualitative, biographically oriented interviews with Italian and German university students and their parents (43 participants), two patterns are identified. The first is an 'independence' pattern, which prioritizes the importance of leaving home in order to grow up. The second is an 'interdependence' pattern which supports the togetherness of the family and sees the family home as the best environment for young adults -i.e., they leave home only for 'inevitable' reasons related to work, education, or family formation. Both patterns are handed down over generations and are transmitted in the socialization process.

TI Empowerment as Contested Terrain Employability of the Dutch workforce
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE social policy; empowerment; employability
AB Sociological analysis has mainly portrayed empowerment as a manipulative, masking discourse. However, various actors in society view it as the opposite of domination and espouse it as a goal. Empowerment can constitute a discursive field shaped by its internal contractions between autonomy and control, between ambition and risk of programmed failure, exacerbated by the emphasis on responsibility, and between focus and stigmatization. The paper presents a case study of controversies and interventions concerning employability in The Netherlands. Employability can be seen as empowerment in matters of career. The study is based on 41 interviews with policy makers, managers, union and employers' leaders and politicians. It shows that actors drawing on the principle of empowerment as a goal in itself can reset or reclaim a drifting empowerment project in its inceptive phase and add their own twist during execution, evaluation and efforts to engineer improvements.

DT Article

ID INFORMAL ECONOMY; EMPLOYMENT
AB This paper evaluates critically the major competing perspectives regarding the participation of the unemployed in undeclared work. These are firstly, the 'marginalisation' perspective which holds that the unemployed disproportionately participate in and gain from undeclared work, and secondly, the 'reinforcement' perspective which holds that the unemployed benefit less from undeclared work than those in declared employment, meaning that undeclared work reinforces, rather than reduces, the inequalities produced by the declared realm. Reporting the results of a 2007 Eurobarometer survey on undeclared work comprising 26,659 face-to-face interviews conducted in the 27 member states of the European Union, the finding is that the marginalisation perspective is applicable to Southern Europe and the reinforcement perspective to Nordic nations. However, in East-Central Europe and Western European nations, as well as the EU-27 as a whole, the marginalisation and reinforcement perspectives are not mutually exclusive but co-exist; the unemployed are more likely to participate in undeclared work but receive significantly lower earnings and gain less from undeclared work than those working undeclared who are in declared jobs. The outcome is a call for a new 'reinforced marginalisation' perspective which holds that the unemployed disproportionately engage in undeclared work but their participation reinforces their marginalised position relative to the employed. The paper then seeks tentative explanations for these findings.

SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Spain; identity; mobility; European Union; Romania
ID PLACE; IMMIGRANTS; MIGRATION
AB Over the past two decades, the theoretical frameworks of human mobility studies have undergone profound changes. The rise of transnational and border analysis, the formulation of the embodied experiences of migration, the increasing interest in migrants' attachment to place and sense of home have coalesced to enrich our understanding of human mobility. This paper explores how Romanian immigrants in Spain interpret the changes to their global identity in terms of self-perceptions within the context of the enlargement of the European Union (EU) towards Eastern Europe. By means of qualitative research, the principal aim of this article is to highlight how the migration process, which is closely tied to border dynamics and European expansion, and which has occurred in stages from 1990 to the present, has influenced the (re)construction of identity and the changes in discourse among immigrants. The experiences of the interviewees show that migration/mobility and place - that left behind in the country of origin and the new place in the receiving country - are essential factors in the reconstruction of identity in the twenty-first century.

TI Couple Bargaining or Socio-Economic Status? Why some parents spend more

AB The quality of time dedicated to child care has potentially positive effects on children's life chances. However, the determinants of parental time allocation to child care remain largely unexplored. We assess two main explanations for differences among parents in the amount of time spent with children. The first, based on the relative resources hypothesis, links variation in time spent with children to the relative attributes (occupation, education or income) of one partner with the other. The second, derived from the social status hypothesis, suggests that variation in time spent with children can be attributed to the relative social position of the couple (i.e. higher status couples spend more time with children regardless of within-couple difference). To investigate these questions, we use a sample of parents living in a partnership with children younger than 10 years old from the 2002 to 2003 Spanish Time Use Survey (STUS) (n = 7438). We find little support for the 'relative resources hypothesis', although it has some explanatory power on supervisory and routine activities performed with children. Instead, consistent with the 'social status hypothesis', we find that time spent on child care is attributable to the social position of the couple, regardless of between-parent differences in income or education. The 'social status hypothesis' is especially relevant for explaining the time that parents devote to activities that have a higher potential for the development of the child's cognitive and social capabilities.

AB This study investigated public attitudes towards pension spending in welfare states. By utilising a dataset covering 21 different Western European countries and conducting a multi-level analyses, three main findings resulted. First, as the welfare status model suggests, the status of welfare duties as well as the status of welfare rights proved to play a key role in shaping the political cleavages over public pensions at both macro- and micro-levels. Second, age and gender also seem to be significant sources of cleavage in addition to class-related variables. Finally, the study examined empirically the interaction effect of age and class-related factors to reveal that class-based interests offset generational interests.

AB The article analyses the support for and determinants of individualistic explanations of poverty among Europeans. The analyses are conducted using multilevel logistic regression models. Findings suggest that the level of support for the individualistic explanation of poverty varies between European nations. Hence, the results contradict the analysis of Alesina and Glaeser (2004, Fighting Poverty in the US and Europe. A World of Difference), which gives us a very homogenous picture of European attitudes towards the poor. Among the determinants of poverty perceptions, welfare regime, short-term economic growth and social expenditures as well as individual-level demographic factors, perceived economic hardship, political affiliation and egalitarian values are associated with the individualistic attribution for poverty. In general, the findings hold critical implications for future research to develop further dynamic measurement of contextual level explanatory factors.

   EMPIRICAL APPLICATION
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article

ID GLOBALIZATION
AB This article seeks to conceptually clarify the measurement of Europeanization from a transactional perspective. Following Karl Deutsch, we regard cross-border practices and sense of community as constitutive for an emerging European society. But we critically reassess how this approach has been put into empirical practice by contemporary scholars. Typically, too much attention is paid to absolute Europeanization, and too little to relative Europeanization. In order to properly investigate the European society as situated between the nation-state and the world society, we argue that Europeanization involves both national openness (the salience of Europe compared to the nation-state) and external closure (the salience of Europe compared to the world). Three indices are suggested to capture relative Europeanization and its major components. Recent Eurobarometer and European Values Study data on practices and attitudes of EU citizens is used to illustrate our approach empirically. The results demonstrate that external closure adds a new layer of information for understanding everyday life Europeanization. We also find a bifurcation between practices for which Europe is the more relevant reference frame (as compared to the world) and attitudes for which it is not.

AB This article investigates the association between economic uncertainties, work-family reconciliation policies and women's short-term childbearing intentions in 10 European countries. I introduce the capability approach to this issue and argue that short-term childbearing intentions are an indicator of women's capabilities to start a family or to have additional children. Using data from the European Social Survey, the analysis reveals that the association between economic uncertainties and short-term childbearing intentions varies by the number of children already born, education and institutional contexts. In some countries, having a job have a positive impact on childless women's short-term intentions, while in other countries, low educated childless women out of the labour market are those most likely to intend to have a child in the near future. Other aspects of economic uncertainties, namely perceived job and income insecurity, have a negative impact on short-term childbearing intentions, regardless of motherhood status. The analysis also shows that the combination of weaker institutional support for work-family reconciliation, perceived job and income insecurity and low educational skills are associated with lower childbearing intentions, and the pattern across the 10 countries is slightly stronger for childless women. This study underscores the importance of embedding individual decision processes in a broader societal context.

AB In this study, we investigate couples' division of household tasks by the age of the youngest child, comparing France, eastern Germany, and western Germany. For our analyses, we draw on Generations and Gender Survey (GGS) data. As expected, our findings are that the division of housework is less egalitarian for couples with preschool age children than for childless couples, and these differences are greatest in western Germany. However, we had also expected the division of housework to be more egalitarian again for couples with older children, among whom maternal employment rates are higher than among those with younger children. Our findings confirmed this expectation for western Germany. Surprisingly though, we found that in both eastern Germany and France, the division of housework was actually continuously less egalitarian the older couples' children. An explanation may be that the traditionalizing impact of parenthood unfolds slowly with parenthood duration as couples increasingly yield to societal expectations regarding parental roles. In western Germany, where women reduce their employment most significantly when becoming mothers, employment status effects appear to dominate any other trends associated with the age of the youngest child.

AB Previous research has yielded quite varying results with regard to the relationship between children and women's sickness absence from work. This study examines the issue using data from the EU Labour Surveys. Cross-sectional data from 2005 covering 23 EU countries plus Norway are used. The data are analysed by means of logistic regression with control for country, age, working hours and socio-economic status. For married/cohabiting women, there is a quite consistent tendency for dependent children to be associated with lower sickness absence. A single young child is, however, related to higher sickness absence in some analyses, suggesting that the transition to parenthood may be stressful. Single mothers do not in general have higher sickness absence than their married/cohabiting counterparts. The tendency toward lower sickness absence in most groups of married/cohabiting mothers is likely to be due to selection to some extent, but also to favourable role accumulation effects.

DT Article
DE perceived conflict in reconciling work and family life; gender;

ID GENDER; WOMEN
AB This paper explores the work family conflict as perceived by working parents in two European countries, Spain and Great Britain (GB). Using data from the International Social Survey Programme, ISSP 2002, we examine the factors that explain the high level of conflict in the two countries, for both men and women. Whereas sex, age and having children at home impact the level of conflict in Spain, education level as a proxy for class is more relevant in the GB. The contrasting perceptions of the work family conflict in the two countries may be taken as indicators of each country's stage in what has been called the 'modernization process'. This study seeks to understand the relationship between the level of 'modernization' and the perception of a high level of conflict in the attempt to reconcile the work family conflict, focusing on the process of 'individualization' on the one hand and measurement of 'the perception of the level of conflict by sex' on the other.(1) The study argues that the difference between these high levels of conflict is explained by variables that refer to ascribed status in Spain (a protraditional model) but to acquired status in GB (a non-interventionist model) indicated by the influence of education level as a variable resulting from a person's effort.

First there is a snapshot of the population's interest in the history of the Czech Republic as such; then the focus is on general aspects of historical consciousness, particularly people's ideas about the importance of the forces that influence the course of history, and their assessment of the general importance of history. Interpretation of the analysis concludes with evaluations of Czech national history and its various stages and major events. In the final discussion there is a comprehensive interpretation of the empirical knowledge gained, in the context of existing theoretical concepts.

AB In light of debates over the compatibility of Islam and democracy, their importance in the EU candidate state of Turkey which has been led by the religious-based Justice and Development Party (JDP) since 2002, and the paucity of research examining liberal-democratic value change, we examine liberal-democratic value change and its sources in Turkey between 2000 and 2008. The results of our descriptive, factor, and multivariate analyses of European and World Values Survey data (2000, 2001, 2007, and 2008) indicate that despite Huntington's (1996) and Turkish secularists' pessimism, people in Turkey have not adopted more politically religious values during this time. However, personal expressions of religiosity are on the rise, and they are intertwined with politically religious values to some extent. People in Turkey have generally adopted less politically authoritarian values, but they are more supportive of military rule in 2008 than before the JDP came to power. Ethnic tolerance peaked in 2007 but declined below its 2001 level in 2008. While human development theory helps to explain these trends and values, the case of Turkey reveals that other, more political factors -such as nationalism -may counteract liberal-democratic value change. The results are suggestive of a political realignment in Turkey that transcends a secular-religious divide. They further suggest that Turkey is moving neither East' nor West'; rather, it is very much moving in its own direction.

AB The discussion on the existence of a distinctive Mediterranean' welfare model has focused on the historical and politico-institutional dynamics, as well as on the policy traits of the welfare arrangements found in Southern European countries. Particular attention has been given to the external pressures and internal constraints faced by the welfare systems of these countries, as well as to what extent there is a common response to such challenges. In this article, we claim that while researchers were embarked in this scholarly effort, Southern European societies kept changing, transforming the nature of existing arrangements in not always forecasted directions, to the point of questioning the adequacy of clustering them under a common type. The current context of economic and financial crisis introduces additional factors in the process of transformation and reform of the welfare schemes of these countries, placed at the epicentre of the turmoil shattering European economies and societies.

AB This paper analyzes the main characteristics and welfare rationale of the Mediterranean typology. Familism, female employment and care are singled out as three representative areas which provide data on the dynamics of continuity and change in the Southern European countries under examination. Particular attention is paid to the increasing female participation in the labour market and the gradual disappearance of the so-called Mediterranean superwomen'. The process of female labour activation is already having a great impact in all activities concerned with the type of care traditionally carried out within Mediterranean households. Final remarks stress the need to pay attention in future research to ongoing societal changes which are bound to have knock-on consequences for Southern European welfare as we have known it until now.

AB This article seeks to re-open the consensus concerning the interrelationship between family values and public support for government versus private family provision. We offer new results from analyses of 2001 data from the International Social Survey Programme for a wide range of countries and world regions. Refining conventional scholarly wisdom, Southern European publics' have high levels of traditional family values, but mainly in contrast to other European countries; familism is also notably strong in Eastern Europe and several of the English-speaking democracies. Even more surprising, family values support is strongly and positively associated with support for public child care provision. We discuss implications of results for understanding the nature of public attitudes and familism in cross-national perspective, and the limits of theorizing identifying family values as the primary cause of welfare state development in Southern Europe.

ID PERSPECTIVE
AB How can we explain that same-sex marriages have been approved in countries like Portugal (2010) and Spain (2005), where the majority of the population identifies with the catholic religion, when they are not recognised in countries with more liberal traditions? Assessing social, economic and legal changes this paper aims to explain the transformations on family, gender and public policies in Portugal in the context of the welfarestate. Two main lines of analysis are pursued.First, changes in practices, attitudes and laws, such as the approval of gay marriage in Portugal (2010), are discussed and related to social, economic and institutional processes. The remarkable fall of catholic marriage in Portugal and the huge growth of children born out of the wedlock, just in one decade (2000-2010), are only some of the examples of these transformations.Secondly, the development of social, family, care and gender equality policies are analysed in order to put the welfare pathway of change in perspective: from a late start in the 1970s and 1980s to the expanding coverage, highlighting welfare-state insufficiencies and limitations as well as, more recently, with ideological and financial pressures for retrenchment.Bridges and troubled relations between social practises, values and public policies are also debated. Our research results are based in data from several sources, namely, European Social Survey (2004, 2006, 2008, 2010), Eurostat and National Statistics.

TI REDEFINING THE DYNAMICS OF INTERGENERATIONAL FAMILY SOLIDARITY IN SPAIN
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Spanish welfare state; dependency care; familist values;
   intergenerational solidarity
AB This article analyses the dynamics of family solidarity in Spain. The existing literature so far has defined the Spanish caring model as familistic due to the primacy of the family in the protection of dependants. However, this article shows that recent data on Spaniards' preferences concerning the care of their family dependents might question the sustainability of the bases of such model. This is consistent with the results of the OASIS Project, according to which societal changes may be leading to family care becoming less duty-driven and more dependent on personal affection and attachment.(1)The five-country (Norway, England, Germany, Spain and Israel) OASIS study collected data from representative, age-stratified, urban-community samples of about 1200 respondents in each country. The Spanish welfare state is labelled as familistic because family makes up for the lack of public benefits dampening adverse economic cycles and the problems of its more fragile members: children, young people and, especially, the elderly. Family solidarity is considered beneficial because it contains public spending and generates positive effects of solidarity and security in the population. Moreover, the expectations of the dependent elderly are focused on family, not on social services that always have been scarce in Spain and they are worsening with the economic crisis. But the Spanish welfare state based on familist values appears to be increasingly ineffective and more difficult to sustain. This article explains how changes in family structure and dynamics, along with the high rates of female labour force that Spain has recently achieved, affect family caregiving preferences and strategies.

AB This paper critically examines the limitations and deadlocks of welfare patterns embedded in the statist-familialist regime that for a long-time has been pivotal for the institutional set up and processes of social redistribution in Greece. Changes to social protection under the combined effect of conflicts and impasses of this regime, and of an intractable sovereign debt crisis (largely due to accumulated deadlocks) that has engulfed the country since the late 2000s are our main focus. Current welfare reforms across major policy areas are examined, with the aim to foreshadow the direction of impending change; and, particularly, to trace any indications of whether reform can bolster inclusive solidarity' and improve redistribution or, instead, will bring about heightened insecurity.

TI FEMALE EMPLOYMENT AND THE ECONOMIC CRISIS Social change in Northern and
   Southern Italy
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE female employment; Italy; inequality; crisis; labour market; welfare
AB One of the characteristics of the Italian peninsula is a sharp North-South gradient on many economic and labour market variables. This gradient is particularly marked in relation to female employment, making Italy a particularly useful laboratory' for studying changes in gender roles. Esping-Andersen's description of the decline of the male breadwinner' model and the search for a new equilibrium' in gender roles is suggestive, but the assumption that current processes will inevitably converge towards a relatively homogeneous social configuration (exemplified by the Scandinavian countries) is rather unconvincing. We will show in this article that the Italian case comprises macro-regions with very different female employment rates and highly differentiated welfare systems. Furthermore, one of the effects of the economic crisis has been to obstruct the entry of women into paid work, particularly in the South where employment rates are already at a very low level. When discussing trends and changes in women's roles, it is important to remember that the resulting transformations are plural, contingent and discontinuous and strongly shaped by prevailing socio-economic conditions. In the context of a prolonged and severe crisis, the differences between Northern and Southern Italy have been further accentuated, impeding the development of coherent policy responses and obstructing change in gender roles.

AB The development of personal social services and female employment is intertwined, not only in the domain of childcare. With the ageing of the population, the changing forms of care and the developments in the eldercare labour market become crucial issues. The new risk of dependency represents a challenge, but also an opportunity. This paper provides an overview of the relationship between the development of long-term care policies and services in distinct European countries and female employment in the care sector. Whereas Northern European countries have developed policies in the field at an earlier stage and continental countries intervened with new policies in the last 10-15 years, in Southern Europe policies remain weak and fragmented. The paper concentrates on the case of Southern European countries, where the weakness of social policies and low development of services did not prevent the rise of a new care labour market. Next to still low employment rates among women, long-term care tends to be provided mainly by migrant care workers often in the underground economy regardless of their legal status. The last development is a key issue for Southern European countries, as discussed in the paper, not only for the current consequences on migrant workers, older people and their families, but also because it is likely to structure any possible future development in long-term care policies.

ID GLOBALIZATION
AB This paper argues that private regulation has been essential to the making of the common European market. The distinction between negative and positive integration, usually used to understand the making of the common European market, only gives us part of the picture, as it focuses on public authorities and the regulation issued by them, and tends to ignore private authorities. A focus on private regulation is suggested to enlarge the focus on positive and negative integration, and this is used in an analysis of EU's removal of barriers to trade from 1958 to 2000. The paper shows that private regulation in the form of technical standardisation has become essential to European market making.

TI TERRITORIAL BORDERS AS INSTITUTIONS: Functional change and the spatial
   division of authority
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE borders; migration control; functions; territory; institutions
AB In sociological research on territorial borders, theoretical concepts prevail which identify borders with migration control and hence conclude from the contemporary trend to ex-territorialise such controls the dissolution between territories and borders. Such an understanding however prevents to distinguish between different instruments and logics of migration control. Departing from this perspective, the argument is developed that borders are more adequately understood as institutionalised rules about the spatial separation of the exercise of authority. Such a perspective provides first to analytically distinguish between borders in general on the one hand and the specific functions particular borders are designed to fulfil on the other hand. Second, such a concept enables us to address how political and societal actors discover the border as an instrument for realising their interests and hence engage in border politics. Third, the possibility emerges to analyse how processes of globalisation and regional integration change the political perception and thereby the political regulation of borders' functions.

AB This paper seeks to understand the way in which social capital resources are incorporated, appropriated and distributed by different social classes in Europe. Its main goal is to produce a conceptual framework by linking the concepts of social capital with the different theoretical assessments made by the sociology of social classes. We use multivariate analysis to work a set of quantitative indicators from the European Social Survey 2008 in order to assess the relationship between these concepts. Our methodological approach combines transnational levels, i.e., it is not an international comparison between European countries but an analysis of individual people and their belonging to social classes.

AB This paper focuses on migration from Slovakia in the context of migration from the 10 countries which became European Union members in May 2004. While on the aggregate level these migration flows confirm the basic assumptions of the neoclassic migration theory, this study tests if insights from the new economics of labour migration (NELM) and migrant network theory are confirmed by those movements. Contrary to Mexico-US migration, such theory evaluation is rather rare in European migration research which is probably caused by the requirement of detailed and reliable datasets. We try to overcome this inconvenience by using Labour Force Survey data. Those data include the necessary information about the households of migrants that can be used to test for predicted interactions. We show on post 2004 labour migration from Slovakia that foreign employment of a household member creates remittance flows and, as expected by the NELM theory, improves the income situation of the household. However, remittances are produced only if the migrating household members are in the position of parents. This finding has consequences for remittance estimations as most of the post accession migration are single young migrants. The existence of intra- and trans-generational migrant networks is also confirmed by our multivariate analysis. While both types of network effects are gender specific, the gender factor seems to be stronger in the case of trans-generational networks. Besides the strong and significant influence of networks that increase the odds of migration to a destination where migrant family members are present, we found preliminary evidence of a culture of migration' in the households of migrants.

DE International migration; return migration; happiness; Romania
ID RELATIVE INCOME; IMMIGRANTS; PARADOX; LIFE
AB Research on happiness finds that rising incomes do not generally lead to increases in happiness. This finding suggests that economic migration - i.e., migration motivated by the prospect of increased income - might not bring greater happiness: when economic migrants believe that migration will improve their lives, that belief might be misguided at least insofar as improvement' is conceived in terms related to happiness. Perhaps economic migration under certain conditions even results in lower happiness, if it involves sacrifices in other respects that are more consequential for happiness. This paper explores these propositions via comparison of Romanian migrants to non-migrants (using data from the European Social Survey) and finds that returned migrants report lower happiness than non-migrants (controlling for other variables), while migrants who have not returned are not different in happiness from stayers. The cross-sectional analysis cannot directly answer questions about the consequences of migration and return - there are no data on the migrants' happiness prior to migration. But the analysis sharpens the questions that might be asked in future research and considers how various scenarios would be consistent with the findings produced here.

AB This paper examines the determinants of family migration from a post-socialist country, the former German Democratic Republic (today, the eastern part of reunified Germany), to a western country, West Germany. The paper seeks to answer the following questions: (1) How does the migration behavior of married and cohabitating men and women differ from that of individuals who live alone? (2) What factors influence family migration? (3) Are there gender-specific differences in the factors that influence migration? Hypotheses are derived from theories of gender roles, household economics, and bargaining to investigate the migration of individuals and families. Data from the Socio-Economic Panel Study covering the period 1992 to 2007 are analyzed using logistic hierarchical regression models. The results show that the male partner's education level is the most important determinant of migration, whereas the female partner's education is of secondary importance. The results generally support the predictions of gender role theory. Despite their egalitarian views and socialization in a socialist country, couples from East Germany exhibit a traditional orientation toward gender roles when making migration decisions.

AB This study uses retrospective life-history data from the SHARELIFE project for an initial assessment of the long-term relationship between individuals' reproductive history and retirement in 13 Continental European countries, focussing in particular on possible gender, cohort, and welfare regime differences. Our analysis provides some weak evidence that having (more) children is associated with later retirement among men, reflecting a continuation of the male provider role well into the late career phase. When distinguishing between women born before and after 1940, we detect striking cohort differences in retirement behaviours of mothers and childless individuals: while mothers belonging to the older cohorts tend to exit the labour force later than their childless counterparts, those born post-1940 exhibit a greater propensity to enter retirement earlier. This finding is discussed against the background of cross-national (i.e., welfare regime) differences in younger mothers' employment opportunities as well as differential economic and institutional opportunities for women (mothers, respectively) to retire early. We conclude with suggestions for future research.

AB The integration and centralization of the European Union (EU) has thus far proceeded without the level of community building necessary to sustain a full-fledged fiscal union. At issue is not the absence of a political union or a democratic deficit' but the very limited post-national community building, a communitarian deficit. The insufficient sharing of values and bonds - not the poor representative mechanisms - is a major cause of alienation from Brussels' and limits the normative commitment to make sacrifices for the common good. Major community building measures, in normative intensive areas, such as education and language must take place if the proposed steps towards significantly greater economic unity are to succeed. But, it is precisely these areas where community building is most absent. Hence it is likely that the current crisis will lead to a scaling back of the EU as administrative state rather than to ever higher levels of integration.

AB This article examines the participation of art galleries at international contemporary art fairs (ICAFs) to evaluate what theories of cultural globalisation best describe this type of practice. For that purpose, it draws upon recent and original statistical data in order to examine the geographical distribution of major ICAFs worldwide, that is, their concentration in selected geographical locations, as well as the country of origin of the galleries participating in these events. This is intended to map out the workings of any territorial forms of dominance affecting the art market, seen both in the capability of a given country to organise one or more ICAFs and in that of art galleries to participate in such high profile events. The article firstly reviews relevant literature on cultural globalisation to outline, and also problematise, those interpretative models that can be applied to the particular case of ICAFs. Secondly, it provides and analyses new statistical data on ICAFs and gallery participation mentioned earlier. Thirdly, it examines how this data can be interpreted with the help of current theories of cultural globalisation. It concludes by arguing that the model best explaining the territorial dynamics of ICAFs is one that incorporates a notion of both centre and semi-peripheral domination on a vast periphery of countries including both Western and non-Western countries.

TI THE PRICE OF ART Uncertainty and reputation in the art field
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE price formation; art markets; culture; uncertainty
ID MARKET; PAINTINGS; RETURNS
AB How do prices for contemporary art come into being? Buyers of contemporary art face a problem of fundamental uncertainty, because what passes as quality is difficult to determine, and buyers can hardly estimate how a specific piece of art will perform as an investment. Since a market for contemporary art presupposes the possibility of at least limited rational purchasing decisions, uncertainty must be reduced. We argue that the value of an art work or artist originates in an intersubjective process of assessment and conferring of reputation by experts in the art field, such as gallery owners, curators, critics, art dealers, journalists, and collectors, who help establish the artistic reputation of a work or an artist. The quality signals emerging from the art field enable buyers to assess the economic value of art works. We tested this initial hypothesis against two datasets containing data on art prices and information from the biographies of artists.

ID ECONOMIZATION
AB In this article, I forward an analysis of the art market that seeks to emphasize the often unexamined yet central economizing practices that fuel the circulation of objects and thus contribute to the distinct patterns of consumption, ownership, and mobilization of the art world. In stressing these economizing practices, I attempt to make visible the underlying sociality and symbolic practices that provide aesthetic and cultural meaning to artistic objects and institutions. The analysis presented here derives from the so-called performativity program and that has been extended in recent years throughout economic sociology. Specifically, this article draws on the performativity program to highlight the mechanisms through which artistic objects are taken-into-account prior to their circulation in the market. As is argued, such forms of actuarial practice are not restricted to orienting action within networks of market exchange; rather, they are partly constitutive of the aesthetic and cultural values attached to art in contemporary capitalism.

TI MUSICIANS MAKE MARKETS Aestheticising music distribution in Beethoven's
   Vienna
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE music; markets; aesthetics; embodiment; agency; Beethoven
AB Arts markets are not neutral'. Rather, they are inevitably coloured by socio-cultural practices and regularities, some of which are embedded in and afforded by aesthetic forms and the values and images associated with these forms. The stabilisation of distribution and consumption patterns over time may thus be linked to, and structured by, often tacitly delineated meanings, values and practices associated with artistic products (musical works and their performance, in this case). These associations afford emotional attachments and identity-stances that may become integral to artistic distribution and in ways that are socially consequential. To the extent that distribution and consumption are inflected in these ways, markets may be understood to be culturally inflected. Market processes, in other words, can be seen as structures that are both shaped by, and shape, the flow and exchange of passion, emotion and often unremarked forms of sensibility. I explore these themes through a case study of the production and distribution of Beethoven's keyboard concertos in early nineteenth century Vienna. I describe how the distribution of Beethoven's works offered gendered object lessons' about music producer/distributers (composer/performers) and music consumers. Through these lessons, the market for high culture music came to be associated with exhibitions of physical prowess, a heroic mien, and, almost exclusively, performances by men.

AB This article shows how deep moral issues can impinge upon popular culture without this losing its commercial appeal, a process made possible by the role of consecrating institutions in the music market. The article focuses on the fabrication and establishment of a new genre within Italian musical culture and music market, the so-called canzone d'autore, and it is set after the suicide in 1967 of singer-songwriter Luigi Tenco during the most important Italian song festival (Sanremo's Festival della canzone italiana). Drawing upon Zelizer's notion of circuits of commerce' and Bourdieu's theory of cultural fields, the article will shed some light on the specific dynamics of the interplay between moral issues and commercial appeal in the Italian music market.

AB This paper presents unique descriptive and explanatory analyses of cross-national variation in work ethic in 44 European countries (European Values Study 2008). A strong work ethic is the conviction that people have a moral duty to work. To explain differences in the adherence of the work ethic between countries two alternative theories are tested: modernisation theory and social institutional theory. Modernisation theory hypothesises that richer, more highly educated and urbanised countries have a weaker work ethic. Alternatively, social institutional theory predicts that countries' religious heritage, generosity of the welfare state and political history can explain differences in work ethic between countries. Multilevel regression models on an unprecedented set of 44 countries show that the modernisation hypotheses are supported. With regard to institutions, it is shown that work ethic is stronger in countries with an Islamic and Orthodox heritage as compared to a Protestant and Catholic heritage and in ex-communist countries and countries with less generous welfare states. When both theories are tested simultaneously, variance decomposition suggests that social institutional theory has more explanatory power than modernisation theory. Religious heritage is shown to be the most important factor to explain variation in work ethic between countries. Thus, although our modern societies become increasingly secularised, religious heritage still impacts our norms and values about work in a significant manner.

AB Drawing on both qualitative and quantitative data, this article explores the extent to which Western art markets are globalized by focusing on the nationality of contemporary artists represented by art galleries in Amsterdam and Berlin. Far from the borderless world presupposed in the globalization literature as well as by art dealers themselves, galleries in both countries show a strong home bias, whilst American artists dominate in Amsterdam and Berlin galleries. The article explains this home bias by focusing on widely diffused organizational practices, business conventions and role models within market settings, which are the outcome of cultural globalization, but also pose barriers to art dealers' global aspirations.

AB This paper takes stock of recent research on patterns of cultural engagement in various European nations, with specific reference to British and Danish research. It argues that Bourdieu's original theorisation of cultural capital in Distinction' needs to be significantly updated to register the decline of highbrow' culture which these studies reveal. However, we argue that this shift does not entail the erosion of cultural capital itself, or the rise of the cultural omnivore', so much as the emergence of a form of cosmopolitan cultural capital'. We argue that this emerging cultural capital can be associated with the partial creation of a European field and testifies to the continued stakes of cultural engagement today

AB The concept of welfare generation and the idea of possible conflicts between generations have been discussed frequently in the context of pension systems. In order to form interest groups that could engage in such a conflict, the generations in question would have to form clear collectives with strong agendas. This article shows that the concept of generation is rather vague and that it is not possible to define a generational collective characterised by its experiences with and attitudes towards the welfare state or the pension system. Pensioner cohorts have so far been identified mainly on the basis of financial transactions. If other resources and characteristics are taken into account, the seemingly clear-cut differences between generations get blurred. Apart from these external factors, there is also no evidence to be found for specific generations perceiving themselves as winners or losers, nor do they show an outspoken conflict potential that would mark them as actors in generational disputes.

AB The comparative analysis of intergenerational support patterns based on SHARE, the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe, with about 30,000 respondents from 11 European countries reveals a distinct geographical distribution of private support patterns: in Northern Europe help between parents and children is very common, but typically little time-consuming. The contrary is true for Southern Europe, where comparably few support relations are very intense in terms of time. Central Western Europe lies in-between with average transfer rates and intensities. Using multilevel modeling, these different support patterns can be explained by the prevalence of public assistance according to the specialization hypothesis: with increased public transfers and social services, sporadic help is more likely (crowding in), and less time consuming support between generations (crowding out) occurs. Accordingly, most support is provided voluntarily in Northern Europe, whereas it is more often perceived as obligatory in Continental and Mediterranean countries.

AB The labour market and the welfare state have been the main institutions responsible for economic welfare in the Nordic countries, whereas the family's role has been mostly complementary. However, this may be changing as the welfare state's role weakens due to cost-containment goals. Based on data sets covering two generations, this study shows that well educated parents in particular are supporting their adult children financially especially while they are studying. Overall, the results suggest that the interaction between the parents' socio-economic position and parental financial backing is stronger than previous studies have indicated. This could lead to diminishing egalitarianism in education alongside class reproduction even in the Nordic welfare states. The results are based on questionnaire data obtained from families across two generations: baby boomers and their adult children. The former data set comprised 1,115 randomly selected Finns born in 19451950, and the latter consisted of 1,435 adult children. Merged data was obtained from 911 adult children who were identifiable as offspring of specific parents from the baby boomers' data set. Multinomial logistic regression was used in the analysis.

DE poverty; intergenerational transmission; welfare regimes; economic

AB The European Union Statistics of Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) 2005 wave includes a special module on inter-generational transmission of poverty. In addition to the standard data relating to income and material deprivation, information relating to parental background and childhood circumstances was collected for all household members aged over 24 and less than 66 at the end of the income reference period. In principle, the module provides an unprecedented opportunity to apply a welfare regime perspective to a comparative European analysis of the relationship between poverty and social exclusion and parental characteristics and childhood economic circumstances. In this paper, we seek to exploit such potential. In pursuing this objective, it is necessary to take into account some of the limitations of the data. We do by restricting our attention to a set of countries where data issues seem less extreme. Finally, we compare findings from one dimensional and multidimensional approaches to poverty and social exclusion in order to provide an assessment of the extent to which our analysis of welfare regime variation provides a coherent account of the intergenerational transmission of disadvantage.

DE social capital; social trust; institutional trust; volunteering;

ID STATE
AB Social capital theory expects volunteering to generate general social trust, while critics point out that there is little evidence to support this claim. The purpose of this article is to show that volunteering can cause trust, depending on the institutional context and the types of organizations for which people volunteer. The data are from representative population surveys conducted in Norway and the Czech Republic in 2009. The analysis shows that in institutional contexts with impartial and reliable institutions, as in the case of Norway, general social trust is very high in comparative perspective, and the experience of volunteering has little additional effect. However, volunteering boosts institutional trust because volunteers get in touch with a political and administrative system that supports and interacts with the voluntary sector. This applies particularly to voluntary organizations in culture, sports, and recreation. In contrast, in an institutional context with elements of clientelism and corruption, as in the case of the Czech Republic, there is no positive effect on institutional trust. However, the level of general social trust is low and the collaborative experience of volunteering can generate social trust. This applies particularly to voluntary organizations that are not associated with the established political culture.

TI A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE RELATION BETWEEN POLITICAL TRUST AND FORMS

SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES

AB In the literature, two competing claims can be found on the relationship between political trust and political participation. While some authors argue that trust is a prerequisite for any form of participation to occur, others claim that distrust can be a motivating factor for participation in non-institutionalised forms of participation. The social movement literature suggests that political trust will only have these behavioural consequences if it is associated with sufficiently high levels of political efficacy. In this article, we rely on the results of the 2006 European Social Survey for an in-depth analysis of the relationship between political trust and participation in 25 countries. The multilevel regression shows that while political trust is positively associated with institutionalised participation, it is negatively associated with non-institutionalised participation. Moreover, the effect of political trust on institutionalised participation is dependent on self-confidence about one's capability to understand politics.

AB Culture policy is a rising issue in local governance. However, the character of this policy is not clear according to the classical division between developmental and redistributive local policies. A first reaction is that culture does not fit into either. But if we dig deeper, we can distinguish three different perspectives on the role of culture in city development following three conceptualisations of cities: (i) creative cities (culture as developmental policy), (ii) planning or educational city (welfare policy), and (iii) cultural scenes approach that stress cultural consumption (transversal policy). These conceptualisations are used by analysts as well as mayors, suggesting three hypotheses to be analysed using a cross-national survey of European mayors. The main results show the transversal character of cultural issues in mayors' agendas, as well as differences in handling cultural issues according the classical growth and welfare approaches to local policy analysis.

AB According to the market transition theory the economic success of individuals in post-communist countries is affected by both individual characteristics and structural contexts. We investigate this claim using data on self-employment in four post-communist countries (Bulgaria, Russia, Estonia and Hungary) in 1996 and 2005. We find support for a relationship between context-characteristics and self-employment; especially countries with lower levels of corruption show higher odds of self-employment. Unexpectedly, as the transformation process proceeded, human capital did not become a more important predictor for self-employment.

AB The dualisation literature has identified the divide between standard and non-standard workers as a new form of inequality in European labour markets. However, we still lack an explanation for this development. One obstacle is that research on the subject is scattered across academic disciplines with different theoretical perspectives. The article confronts a political economy with an economic perspective on dualisation. It discusses how both relate to each other and what the respective empirical implications are. Both perspectives are assessed in a historical case study on the growth of fixed-term contracts (FTCs) in France. It shows that the changing use of FTCs cannot be explained by deregulation and should be seen as part of a broader change toward flexibility-oriented management styles. Rather than the other way around, the factual use of FTCs in France affected the politics of labour market reform by forcing policy makers to respond to the changing behaviour of firms and job seekers.

TI POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ELITES IN SWITZERLAND Personal interchange,

SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES

DT Article
DE economic elites; political elites; fields; multiple correspondence
   analysis
ID INTERLOCKS; NETWORKS; FIELDS
AB As a legacy of the early stages of its state building process, Switzerland continues to be characterised by a cohesive elite whose members simultaneously occupy political and economic positions. Whereas sectoral analyses of the economic or political elite are widespread, few researchers have scrutinised the connections between business and politics. Therefore, this paper focuses on the linkages between the economic and political fields. Based on a joint multiple correspondence analysis of the CEOs and board members of the 110 largest Swiss companies in 2000 and 256 parliamentary members, we examine the interactional and objective relations between the fields through an analysis of personal interchange, participation in meeting places and structural homology of educational capital. It appears that the connections between elites are cumulative: in each field, the dominant faction shares a background in law or engineering, participates in meeting places, and personally moves between the fields. Reversely, the dominated, which come from a rather heterogeneous educational background, are excluded from interactional relations and moves between the two fields. That the two forms of elite coordination coincide and reinforce each other could be typical for a small country with little differentiated fields, where elite members quickly get to know each other and can easily meet on a regular basis.

AB The creation of a EUropean demos is often debated by referring to forms of ethnic or civic identities. The present article aims to expose the theoretical shortcomings of this dichotomous approach, which confines the complexity of EUrope within a simplifying methodological nationalism. By relying on empirical data collected in four different EUropean regions, the article points to the relevance of a functional or utilitarian rationale which EUropean interviewees use to justify the existence of EUrope. Although this rationale does not obliterate cultural and civic narrations of EUrope, I would argue that it invites to reconsider the traditional role played by identities in the construction of political institutions. Accordingly, I believe that scholars should take more seriously the metaphor 'EUrope as a laboratory' - a convenient, but often empty metaphor.

AB This article seeks to shed light on the identity problem of the European Union by investigating EU justifications for past enlargements. What kind of understanding of the EU do enlargement decisions indicate? Given that the EU is based on more than mere pragmatic problem-solving, the question is whether decisions to enlarge reflect a value-based or a rights-based polity. Although a certain sense of distinctiveness, certain elements of European particularities, are in evidence, the pull of universal principles has proven stronger thus far. Paradoxically, this presents the European political project with an important dilemma.

ID NORMATIVE POWER; EU; SECURITY; TURKEY
AB The debate about the role of the EU in international politics is dominated by the characterisation of the EU as a normative power. In this article, I argue that there are fundamental tensions between the core values that the EU is supposed to embody and articulate in this context. In a first step, I introduce democracy and justice as two exemplary values associated with European integration and introduce the argument about the tensions between these values, which I largely take from the so-called English School of International Relations. This then serves as a basis for exploring these tensions in relation to two illustrative cases: EU-Turkey relations and the control of the external EU (or, to be more precise, Schengen) border. I conclude that the EU's often-invoked character as a 'post-modern' political system may well apply to its internal configuration, but much less so to its external relations. It thus cannot escape the normative tensions inherent to a territorially configured international society.

AB The European Union has been constructed through common ontologies of a world composed and divided on spatial scales. This paper elaborates on this point and examines anthropologically some of the key notions that have been called on to construct the EU, notably that of 'culture'. It is suggested that we might profitably take 'culture' out of our own analytical tool-kits and treat it instead as an interesting but problematic invention. Drawing on the author's own fieldwork inside European institutions, the paper explores relevant aspects of life inside the Commission and what it is to be 'European'. The paper sets out some of the negative and positive ways in which 'culture' is lived or understood in the Commission, and it outlines some of the problems of 'culture' as an analytical tool, from its earlier history to the stereotypes it still encourages, and in so doing points to aspects of the practical imagination and difficulties of the EU project more generally. We see that Europe may respect cultures but only by cherishing the notionally culture-free.

AB This article argues that the exceptionally complex spatial organisation of integration is shaped by spatial patterns of socio-cultural difference and similarity which emerge over the course of history. I outline two interacting socio-cultural factors that help shape the spatial patterns of integration: the international relations culture of demilitarised relations between neighbouring countries and northern Euroscepticism. I show that these have different historically evolving spatial patterns, which affect how specific regions and countries engage with integration. I propose that Europe's spatially differentiated integration and weak collective identity are increasingly bringing this connection between culture, geography and politics to prominence. This is rarely noticed however, because the centrality of collective identity in defining the geography of nations has made it the main focus of academic study and political speculation. My approach makes Europe's historical geography an 'actor' in the spatial patterning of integration. However the complexity of interacting historical factors and continuous historical change differentiate this approach from essentialist and deterministic theories of historical continuities in the EU's geography.

DT Article

ID PUBLIC SUPPORT
AB Since the founding of the European Union, religion has become an increasingly important aspect in shaping European identity and thereby social cohesion in Europe. Social cohesion depends to a high degree on a successfully established distinction between 'us' and 'them'. Religion became one important marker of such boundaries. However, religion works both as an individual-level and an EU-level property. In order to take religion into consideration on the level of individual religiousness and as an institutionalised framework, we combine an analysis of key documents of the European Commission with a quantitative analysis of individual attitudes towards Europe. This combination of methods enables us to track the 'discovery of religion' by the European Commission as a means for social cohesion and the potential of religion to create Europeanness among the EU-citizens. We focus on the crucial period between 1990 and 2000 in which the major system transformation from EEC to EU took place. The quantitative analysis is conducted as a multi-level analysis on the basis of the European Value Survey 1990 and 2000. The data reveal that in fact over a 10-year period, the European integration project has begun to evolve towards an identity project with religion as a key factor on both levels.

AB This paper investigates (trends and determinants of) individual combinations of religious believing and belonging in Europe from a cross-national and longitudinal perspective. Individual level data for the period 1981-2007 in 42 countries derived from the European Values Survey and the European Social Survey are harmonised and enriched with contextual characteristics, constituting a more comprehensive data base for Europe than any previous research. Complementary hypotheses from modernisation and market theories are derived systematically and tested rigorously. We find differential trends. In western societies, the popularity of secularity and consistent religiosity has persisted. In former communist societies, the popularity of consistent religiosity has increased whereas secularity has decreased. In both western and former communist societies, solitary religiosity has been a clear yet small phenomenon, somewhat increasing in western societies and somewhat decreasing in former communist societies. A crucial hypothesis derived from modernisation theories, stating that financial and social security would decrease consistent religiosity, is empirically supported.

AB Based on a review of contributions from labour sociology, gender studies and neighbouring areas, this article starts by describing the recent manners in which domestic work emerged as a topic of interest. Then, key difficulties underlying the subject in hand are discussed. It is argued that analysis should comprehend the link between the position of in-house services at the lower end of work value hierarchies and the political dynamics of knowledge societies, which requires attention to the role of mentality and ideology in mediating everyday interaction. Ethnic change, the singularity of private households as workplaces and the ambiguous bond between skill and emotional labour are central issues. Some particular perspectives of labour studies are bound to offer an improved lens in generating answers as to where the distribution of fatigue and indignity is actually being decided - and challenged.

DE statistical discrimination; recruitment; low-skill workers
ID SOCIAL NETWORKS; JOB; MARKET
AB This paper deals with the recruitment strategies of employers in the low-skilled segment of the labour market. We focus on low-skilled workers because they are overrepresented among jobless people and constitute the bulk of the clientele included in various activation and labour market programmes. A better understanding of the constraints and opportunities of interventions in this labour market segment may help improve their quality and effectiveness. On the basis of qualitative interviews with 41 employers in six European countries, we find that the traditional signals known to be used as statistical discrimination devices (old age, immigrant status and unemployment) play a somewhat reduced role, since these profiles are overrepresented among applicants for low skill positions. However, we find that other signals, mostly considered to be indicators of motivation, have a bigger impact in the selection process. These tend to concern the channel through which the contact with a prospective candidate is made. Unsolicited applications and recommendations from already employed workers emit a positive signal, whereas the fact of being referred by the public employment office is associated with the likelihood of lower motivation.

AB Assuming that migration and integration have lasting effects on economic and social processes, this paper analyses if a diverse cultural environment has a positive impact on labour market success. We expect that culturally diverse labour markets provide new opportunities through an open and tolerant climate, thus contributing to overall economic growth. We test this assumption by analysing the successful transition from education to work depending on the regional distribution and ethnic mix of the foreign population in Germany (cultural diversity). To account for variation within Germany, cultural diversity is observed at small administrative units. We analyse a cohort of young adults at the time of the successful completion of their apprenticeship in Germany and follow them through the beginning of their career. The concentration on a homogenous group regarding occupational certificates enables us to focus on the effects of the local and social environment as well as individual characteristics such as their national background on finding a job (or not). We apply an instrumental variable design to disentangle the effects of cultural diversity and share of foreigners. The results show that both young foreigners and Germans face significantly lower barriers for employment entry in culturally more diverse German regions.

ID RESPONSIBILITY; POLITICS; EUROPE
AB In this article we examine generalised helping and specifically the importance people attach to helping other people, the extent to which they help in practice and their perceptions of how much people living locally help each other. We consider the extent to which the value of help is associated with other civic engagement activities such as, for example, volunteering, signing a petition and contacting a politician. Our findings suggest that the importance people attach to helping others and the extent to which they help in practice (in terms of helping with or attending activities in their local area) varies considerably across Europe. People are more likely to see helping other people as important than actually help in practice. However, helping in practice is more strongly associated than helping as a value, with other civic engagement activities. It seems that the value of help is detached from what people do in their everyday lives. Both the value of help and helping in practice are associated with the extent to which people in their local area are perceived to help each other. Our findings concerning generalised helping have important implications for the understanding of civic society and the contribution citizens can make.

AB In the current literature there is emerging consensus about a positive correlation between countries' welfare efforts and the social capital of their inhabitants: the larger the welfare state, the more social capital its inhabitants have. This paper pulls the discussion an important step further by asking what mechanisms can be responsible for this correlation. Based on theory and previous findings, we formulate a conceptual model of how the macro- micro relationship could come about. The hypotheses are tested using Eurobarometer data. While most of the mechanisms hypothesised are also found empirically, a substantial part of the direct macro-to-micro effect remains after controlling for the presumed most important intervening factors. Our conclusion is that the relationship is still not well understood and needs more academic attention in future research.

AB This paper examines the long-held thesis that political participation educates and transforms individuals. The theoretical framework of this study combines two theories: the theory of the formative effect of elections and the participatory democracy theory. The central contention of this research is that the more an individual has participated in EP elections, the more strongly one holds positive attitudes toward the EU. To deal with the reverse causality that might flow from positive attitudes toward the EU to voting participation in the EP elections, this study employs instrument variable (IV) regression analysis. The results of the analysis using Eurobarometer 54.1 provide support for a significant effect of voting participation in the EP elections on the formation of positive attitudes toward the EU.

AB The objective of this research is to understand the nature and diffusion of antisemitism and Islamophobia in Italy. It is based on 1528 interviews among a representative sample of the Italian population stratified according to age, gender, and residence. The questionnaire used was built by a set of different scales: antisemitic, Islamophobic, and three others scales to take into account authoritarian, ethnocentric, and anomic attitudes. To test assumptions regarding the impact of these predictors of antisemitic and Islamophobic prejudice, it was decided to adopt the statistical technique of path analysis. Outcomes of our research draw attention on the distribution of antisemitism and Islamophobia among Italian people, their nature as a combination of old and new prejudices, and their linking with broader sets of attitudes such as anomie, ethnocentrism, and authoritarianism.

AB According to several international surveys Spain is among the western countries with the most negative views of Jews. While quantitative data on the topic accumulates, there is a significant lack of interpretative approaches that might explain the particular Spanish case. This paper presents the background, methodology and major results of a discussion group-based study on antisemitism, which was conducted in Spain in the autumn of 2009. The study identifies and locates in different socio-economic and ideological milieus the range of stereotypical discourses on Jews, Judaism and the Arab-Israeli conflict in Spain. Analysis of the group meetings shows that, despite growing secularization in Spanish society, the central explanatory variable for persisting and resurging antisemitism in this country is still religion in a broad cultural sense.

DE antisemitism; Islamophobia; racism; Danish cartoons; Swiss ban on

AB This paper discusses the relationship between antisemitism and Islamophobia, focusing on debates in Arab newspapers in the wake of the Second Intifada and 9/11 and then in response to two issues of contention for Muslim communities in Europe, the Danish cartoon crisis in 2006 and the Swiss referendum on building minarets in 2009. The paper relates these debates to major UN and EU resolutions for combating racism, Islamophobia and antisemitism. The aim of this paper is to explore how far discussion of antisemitism and Islamophobia in the Arab world is dominated by those who see Islamophobia as the real danger in today's Europe and antisemitism as a Zionist ploy, and how far antisemitism and Islamophobia have become two competing terms relating to two communities that perceive themselves as victims of prejudice and racism and also of each other. The paper seeks to qualify this image. It acknowledges that the entanglement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict adds a political aspect to the discussion of the two terms, intensifies competition between them for recognition as unique forms of racism and discrimination, and curtails the creation of positive ground for dialogue. However, it also demonstrates the presence of other voices which are more open to addressing both forms of exclusion.

Drawing on the case study of Gustav Freytag's best-selling novel Soll und Haben (Debit and Credit, 1855), the paper argues that antisemitism and racism frequently represent complementary reactions to the experience of capitalist modernisation.

DE antisemitism; France; racism; identity; ethnicity; social mobility
AB This article discusses the so-called newness of today's antisemitism through the historical and social specificities of antisemitism in French society. It casts light on the continuities of antisemitic discourse in France, but also its transformation in relation to the French colonial heritage and the recent 'communitarianisation' of France's social life. This analysis of antisemitism is furthered by the presentation of two case-studies: the controversial discourses of comedian Dieudonne and Kemi Seba, leader of a black supremacist movement called Tribu KA which stirred controversies in the 2000s. These two examples emphasise the fact that antisemitic discourse is better understood as a narrative about downward social mobility and status, which hardly makes antisemitism new.

AB Opposition to racism and antisemitism is often assumed to be a distinguishing feature of radical left politics. Before and during the Holocaust, the most radical case of antisemitism, most Marxists were slow to recognise the threat posed to the Jews. After the event, there has been little significant rethinking. There may then be difficulties if and when antisemitism reappears. There are, however, some neglected resources within Marxism which could help shape a more effective response to a problem which continues to trouble European and other societies even after this traumatic event.

AB This paper analyzes the relation between different forms of civic engagement and corruption. This first of all extends earlier analyses linking generalized trust to corruption by incorporating another element from the social capital complex (namely formal forms of civic engagement). Second, based on the idea that social networks' beneficial or harmful impact may depend on their characteristics, it investigates how the structure of social networks (i.e., inclusive vs. exclusive and isolated vs. connected) matters. Evaluating the engagement - corruption nexus for a cross-section of 20 European democracies in 2002/2003, we confirm that social networks are linked to corruption even when controlling for the effect of generalized trust, and that their relation to corruption is type-specific. These findings survive under various model specifications and robustness checks.

AB Departing from growing concerns about in-work poverty and the proliferation of flexible employment, we investigate the association between temporary employment and poverty in a European comparative perspective. In doing so, we focus specifically on possible gender dimensions, because some are concerned that the impact of flexible employment on income security will be different for men and women and that gender inequality will increase. By means of a logistic multilevel model, we analyse recent EU-SILC data for 24 European countries. The results show that the temporarily employed have a higher poverty risk vis-a-vis permanent workers, mainly caused by lower wages. However, the risk factors to become working poor are similar. The poorly educated, young workers and those living in a single earner household with dependent children have an increased probability to live in poverty, whether they are employed on temporary or permanent basis. Differences between European welfare regimes demonstrate that policy constellations influence the magnitude of these risk factors. Counter-intuitively, temporary working women have a lower poverty risk than their male counterparts. They are better protected because they are more often secondary earners in a dual earning household, while men are more often primary earners. This article advances knowledge on the linkages between temporary employment, economic insecurity and gender differences in European welfare states.

TI WORK, LIFE COURSE, AND GENDER Career and non-career jobs in context
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article

ID TYPOLOGIES
AB Since Norwegian family-friendly policies are gender neutral while the division of labour in families is gendered, some argue that the generous state support for families may end up upholding the status quo; it may perpetuate the existing inequitable division of labour between mothers and fathers in the home and in the labour market in which some women take long maternity leave and work part-time. Since many gender equality measures are intended to increase the percentage of women in male-dominated occupations and positions, they are aimed at occupations with upwardly mobile trajectories. A typological distinction between 'career' and 'non-career' work is made in the analysis of biographical cases of men and women in two different organisational settings. Their thoughts and actions in relation to their occupational trajectories over the life course are examined in different layers of context in order to understand how a complex set of factors affects ways of adjusting to the phase of being parents of young children. The paper concludes that the relationship between gender equality measures and family-friendly policies is not necessarily characterised by tensions, but must rather be considered in relation to a complex set of circumstances in men's and women's life courses that include family, education, and occupation as well as organisational settings that for the many do not involve career jobs.

ID TRANSNATIONALISM
AB In the current discourse it is frequently stated that in the course of European integration and globalisation we witness more intensified and more frequent transactions spanning across national borders. These assumptions relate not only to transactions in the economic sphere or to forms of political co-operation, but to the individual lifeworlds as well. Yet concerning the latter dimension, research into the patterns and dynamics of interpersonal interaction, relationships, and forms of mobility across national borders is scarce. This paper is a contribution towards filling this research lacuna. It addresses the question of the extent to which horizontal Europeanisation, understood as different forms of individual cross-border activities within the European Union, depends on characteristics at the country level. From a comparative perspective we will analyse the transnational mobility and cross-border networks of European citizens within a European context. Empirically, we refer to data from the Eurobarometer 65.1 (2006), which allows us to answer the question how certain contextual variables, such as internationalisation, modernisation, and characteristics such as the respective country's geography, affect people's participation in cross-border activities. Based on a sample of 25 European countries, we will demonstrate that geographic characteristics drive social transnationalism less than internationalisation, Europeanisation, and modernisation, which contribute to a proliferation of individual transnational activities across the European Union.

AB This article seeks to analyze the extent of welfare state tendencies towards individualization of social citizenship rights from the perspective of Cosmopolitan Europe (Beck and Grande 2007, Cosmopolitan Europe). Empirical study of legislated reforms to national insurance benefit schemes in three European countries since 1980 suggests that individualization processes transform modern West European societies through the construction of self-sufficiency, the individualization of responsibility, and the personalization of social services. Although European welfare states vary with respect to the extent of individualization of social categories, late modernization processes appear to transform national solidarities into a cosmopolitan solidarity and hence affect all modern institutions of welfare states, including bureaucratic categories, legal rights, and meaning of work.

AB This paper explores connections and disconnections in the study of racism and antisemitism within sociological inquiry. It begins with an exposition of how certain prominent theorists of racism and antisemitism (e.g., Du Bois, Fanon, Arendt) have in the past identified important connections between these fields of exclusion and persecution in the making of European modernity. While their analysis of connections between racism and antisemitism may have been uneven and provisional, the more recent tendency to replace such connectivity with separatist or even oppositional readings has been a step backward. This tendency toward what we call 'methodological separatism' impoverishes our sociological imagination for a number of reasons. First, it neglects the extent to which prejudice and persecution in relation to Muslims, Jews and Black people are connected phenomena in the formation of European modernity. Second, it encourages divisive and competitive analytical approaches which lock their protagonists in rival camps and reproduce aspects of the language of racism they oppose. While affirming the distinctive characteristics of anti-Black and anti-Jewish racisms, we argue that the development of a more integrated approach is required to enable our understanding of how modernity continues to operate.

AB One of the major contributions of Pierre Bourdieu in Distinction was to illuminate the function of cultural consumption as a marker of status in 1960s' France. Since then, there has been an ongoing debate as to whether these findings are applicable in other national contexts, and not least whether other forms of symbolic boundary-drawing might be more relevant. Based on a survey conducted in the Danish municipality of Aalborg in 2004 and by using multiple correspondence analysis, I am able to show that both cultural consumption and politico-moral stances serve as markers of class positions. By introducing a range of qualitative semi-structured interviews, I argue that politico-moral boundaries are at least as important as cultural boundaries, and that both are used to establish symbolic boundaries between social positions, divided by the same principles as those found by Bourdieu in Distinction; that is, by the volume and the composition of economic and cultural capital. One of the distinctions cutting across both the cultural and the politico-moral modes of drawing boundaries is a divide between what I have termed a global and a local mode of orientation. Finally, antipathies towards cultural elites are expressed through aversions against state subsidisation of highbrow culture.

AB Finland and Germany are traditionally seen as members of different welfare regimes with rather different approaches to family policies. During the last decade or so, poverty concerns have received an increasingly prominent position within family policy in both countries. The objects for these concerns have been different constellations of poor families, and the policies pursued to counteract poverty have ranged from targeted measures to investments in childcare services. It has been suggested that the motivation behind recent social policy developments in Europe is a stronger accentuation of so-called social investment ideas calling for more activation, targeting and higher future returns through investments in human capital. This article explores the impact of social investment ideas on policy discourses about family-related poverty in Finland and Germany since the late-1980s by analysing poverty constructions and anti-poverty policy recommendations in government and party programs. The findings suggest a stronger focus on social investment ideas in the German discourse in terms of higher accentuation of ideas relating to equal opportunities, activation and prevention of poverty in a life-cycle perspective, whereas targeting have become a main topic in Finnish elite discourses. Furthermore, while being conditioned by institutional factors and historical policy legacies, social investment ideas have largely been adopted in an incremental way parallel to path-dependent national policy legacies.

ID POLITICAL-PARTICIPATION
AB Critical consumption, the purchase or boycott of goods for political, ethical or environmental reasons, is regularly characterised as an example of 'new politics' or 'new' political participation. However, such analysis often neglects work from the sociology of consumption and social movement studies. This paper argues that consumers express their identity through critical consumption, in the form of a pledge of allegiance to the goals of certain social movements. Cross-national data from the European Social Survey identifies critical consumers as belonging to higher class positions and being generally older, highly educated, and more often women than men. Separating analysis of boycotting from that of buycotting, the positive purchase of goods for ethical or political reasons, suggests that buycotting is more resource-dependent and individualistic than boycotting. Substantial differences are found between the impact of people's resources in different countries, particularly between Northern and Central European countries and their Southern and Eastern counterparts. The findings thus recommend an approach to consumer politics that remains sensitive to social structural contexts between countries and different forms of consumer participation.

AB Since the 1970s, inequalities in earnings among men have risen in many countries. In the same period, married women's labour force participation has increased. This may affect inequality in household earnings in three ways, related to (a) the degree of inequality in women's earnings, (b) the share of women's earnings of total household earnings, and (c) the correlation of wife's and husband's earnings. Using Annual Norwegian Labour Force Surveys 1974-2004, with added register data on earnings, we find an equalizing effect of wives' earnings over time. Empirical analysis and simulations of hypothetical developments in household earnings inequality show that women's labour supply is the main explanation for these trends.

AB This article examines the role of family policy in shaping mothers' choice between work and care and the perceived occupational consequences of that choice. A central question concerns how parental/maternal leave and childcare policies affect the occupational consequences for mothers who spend time on full-time caring. Using comparative data from the second round of the 2004/05 European Social Survey, the analysis shows that the duration of career interruption due to care-giving and different care policies influence mothers' subjective feelings about caring for children having negative consequences for their careers. On the one hand, our findings confirm the hypothesis that long-term absence from the labour market due to full-time care has negative consequences for women's occupational careers. On the other hand, our findings show that countries with well paid leave schemes combined with access to high quality childcare reduce the perceived negative occupational consequences of the time spent on full-time care. This is the case independently of the duration of the career interruption due to care-giving.

AB This study examines to what extent the often found association between marital status and self-assessed health is influenced by the marital composition of the country people live in. Four hypotheses explaining why the national marital status composition may be influential are derived and tested. Whereas earlier research in this field solely focused on divorce rates, this study includes six different indicators of the national marital status composition to provide a comprehensive test of our expectations. We employ data on 29 European countries (European Social Survey 2002, 2004, and 2006, N=97,797). Multilevel regression analyses demonstrate that both the strength of the relationship between marital status and health, and which unmarried group is most disadvantaged, vary across European countries. Living in a country with a high proportion of married people appears to be beneficial to the health of never married persons, but detrimental for widowed people. Additionally, our findings contradict the argument that divorced, widowed, and never married persons may be best off when living in countries with high proportions of people who are in the same situation. Finally, our results show that the never married are worst off in countries with a high proportion of cohabitants. This may reflect stronger health selectivity into cohabitation in countries where cohabitation is more common. We conclude that the ways through which the marital status composition influences the association between marital status and health appear to be complex and highly dependent on the exact marital status groups that are examined.

AB Although scholarly interest in family migration is increasing, along with attention to the role of women and children in migration processes, this aspect of mobility continues to be poorly understood, particularly in the European context. Research on migration has tended to focus on primary migrants and to pay less attention to whether migrants arrive with families, resulting in a restricted picture of the impact of migration. This paper examines the presence and participation of families and children in the process of migration. It does so within the specific context of intra-European labour migration. Based on a qualitative study of migration and the integration of Polish families and children in Scotland, the paper explores changes in family structures and migration patterns that result in diverse new household migration behaviours. It argues that the locations of migrants within the European Community have become more fluid, with families being increasingly likely to inhabit more than one residence. It also argues that the uniqueness of the European setting requires a coherent theoretical focus and conceptual framework for understanding the implications of family migration. It suggests that transnational lenses generate useful empirical approaches concerning migration movements within the European Community. The paper explores transnational migration theory in relation to Polish post-enlargement migration and examines the multiple ways in which families may change through migration. It analyses the role of gender (women and men) and generations (grandparents, parents and children) in migration and settlement in the new country.

AB In research on immigration, a lot of attention is devoted to the intergenerational socio-economic mobility of second and third generation immigrants, but little is known about the class mobility of first generation migrants. We address this issue with the use of a representative survey on middle-aged and elderly immigrants in France. A comparison between the socio-economic status of each male respondent during his childhood and at the time of the interview reveals some variation in class mobility across countries and regions of origin. At the same time, our analysis of the main determinants of the socio-economic status of the respondents at the end of their careers highlights a strong influence of the socio-economic environment during their childhoods and gives support to our main hypothesis of a dominance effect.

AB The German multi-tiered school system functions as an institutional mechanism which prevents students from certain social class backgrounds from fulfilling their individual learning potential. Their cognitive abilities are not transformed into corresponding school performances and credentials. Against this backdrop, we ask whether the transition from school to vocational training may enable young people with intermediate and those with lower secondary school degrees to demonstrate their cognitive abilities irrespective of school certificates. We further aim to scrutinise the role of personality traits (Big Five) during the transition process. The analyses based on the German Socio-Economic Panel show - in line with previous research - that type of school degree is crucial in the transition process: Those with intermediate school degrees have faster transitions than those with lower degrees. Moreover, our findings suggest that the relative impact of credentials, cognitive abilities, and personality on labour market success cannot be answered universally. Instead, the relevant mechanisms appear to vary substantially by type of school degree.

AB Participation patterns in industrialized democracies have changed considerably in the last couple of decades. While institutionalized forms of participation (e.g., party membership) are declining, we can observe a rise in the occurrence of non-institutionalized forms of political participation. In this article we pose the question of what the effect of this trend has been for patterns of political stratification during the period 1974-2002 using the Political Action Survey as well as the European Social Survey. It can be observed that gender differences have been substantially reduced and in some cases even reversed for non-institutionalized participation and women tend to be more active in these forms than men. Younger age groups also clearly have a preference for non-institutionalized forms. Stratification based on education, however, remains the same compared to the 1970s. These findings are confirmed by a longitudinal analysis of Dutch Election Studies data for the period 1971-1998. We conclude that the emergence of new forms of political participation might have reduced age and gender based inequalities; however, it does not offer a solution for inequalities based on education.

AB Upper classes and elites are usually exclusive circles which are hard to enter. In this paper we approach one such group using a focus group interview: a group from the Swedish-speaking upper class in officially bilingual Finland. Our paper addresses Bourdieu's idea of distinction by cultural or taste distinctions. In comparison to some international studies on elites and upper classes, our group was surprisingly keen on expressing disgust towards other tastes and lifestyles and therefore other classes and/or social groups. One might be surprised at how efficiently distinction works in the Swedish-speaking old upper class and how politically incorrect its outspokenness about cultural superiority is. In this specific group, there is a double-distinction: not only are Finnish speakers looked down upon regardless of their class position, almost any other group is, too. In this sense, this is more or less a case par excellence of Bourdieu's theory of distinction.

AB This paper considers two common assumptions that often arise in the empirical literature on xenophobia - namely that xenophobic attitudes are found mostly among the poorly educated, and that xenophobia mainly concerns immigrants from low social classes and from geographically and culturally disparate nations. These arguments will be discussed in the context of the migration of high-skilled Germans to Switzerland, a phenomenon that has increased markedly in the last few years, leading to major controversies. A survey conducted in the city of Zurich has shown that Germans are considered less likable than other Western Europeans. Over the course of our analyses, two arguments are tested. First, I consider whether the boundaries between culturally similar groups are actually less fragile than those occurring between more dissimilar groups. Following this line of reasoning, I consider whether Swiss-Germans perceive German immigration as a cultural threat. Second, I consider whether well-educated people in high positions or people who seek to improve their job positions may feel threatened by new arrivals who are similarly well-educated. This rationale corresponds to the classic argument that working class people are xenophobic out of a fear that immigrants will take their jobs. Ultimately, this study finds empirical support for both arguments.

AB This article investigates the intergenerational transmission of education in 28 European countries. The main aim is to answer the following questions: (1) To what degree are parents' education and the educational attainment of their children related in different countries and cohorts, and (2) how can we explain the country-cohort variation in these effects by looking at contextual characteristics? In order to explain this variation, we focus on the degree of industrialisation, female labour force participation, the structure of the educational system and the political ideology of a country. Regarding industrialisation, we do not only take its size into account, but also the pace of the development. Multilevel estimates on 76,821 individuals nested in 250 country-cohort combinations from three waves of the European Social Survey (2002-2006) show that we cannot fully support the prediction of decreasing intergenerational transmission of education solely under the influence of industrialisation. While being an important factor that positively influences the general level of schooling for a certain cohort in a particular country, its decreasing effect of the parents' education on their children's schooling is complemented by the other interacting contextual factors, such as female labour force participation and the quality of the school system.

AB The headscarf ban in Turkey has provoked heated debate both in and outside the country. A great deal of research considers the broader philosophical, political, historical, and social implications of the ban but to this point, no large-scale study has focused on the social and economic implications for the women themselves. This study addresses this issue, arguing that the intensification of the ban after the 1980s served the exclusionist aims of the elite to protect their privileged positions and to slow social and regional mobility. Using data collected in 2007 from 1,206 women, we show that women have been affected negatively in a variety of ways. Veiled women have a significantly lower level of education and are substantially more likely to be unemployed than unveiled women. Veiled women from cities where the ruling party argues for banning the headscarf in the public domain have lower levels of education and a higher level of unemployment than veiled women in cities where the ruling party is against the ban.

AB Previous studies on divorce have found consistent empirical evidence that a negative association exists between marital disruption and children's wellbeing, life chances and intergenerational relations. However, there are relatively few studies on the long-term effect of divorce on parent-child contacts. Furthermore, contemporary research is confronted with two declining effect hypotheses. Firstly, it has been argued that the negative effects of divorce may possibly decrease as children's age at time of divorce increases; secondly, it has been suggested that the consequences of divorce might be less severe the more frequent marriage dissolution is in a society. By using data from Sweden, Denmark, Belgium and France from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, we analyze the existing relation between parents' divorce and the intensity of parent-child contacts. Furthermore, we provide some empirical evidence on the two declining effect hypotheses. Our findings show that divorce has long-term negative effects on the intensity of intergenerational relations. The results do not provide any evidence in favor of either the individual or the collective declining effect hypothesis.

AB The current paper is aimed at contributing to the ongoing debate about divergence and convergence of family patterns in Europe. By adding several Eastern European countries and using several additional background indicators of cohabiting unions, the paper explores previous considerations of unmarried cohabitation. The main conclusion is that, as a universal trend, cohabitation is spreading across Europe and that while acquiring a normative value in a country it starts to develop its internal diversity. Besides convergence (with reference to universalistic approach), there is a noticeable trend towards divergence of the cohabitation patterns in Europe. The analysis is based on the European Social Survey, Round 2, 3 and 4 (2004, 2006 and 2008 respectively) and includes the data of 15 European countries (Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, France, Slovakia and Slovenia).

LA English
DT Article
DE occupational attainment; social class; education; cohort effects
ID CAREER MOBILITY; STRATIFICATION; UNEMPLOYMENT
AB Studies of intergenerational class mobility and of intragenerational occupational mobility have of late tended to diverge in their concerns and methodology. This reflects assumptions regarding the increasing part played by education in intergenerational mobility and the decreasing part played by class origins in intragenerational mobility, once education is controlled. The paper contributes to the questioning of these assumptions on empirical grounds. Analyses are made of the occupational mobility of men in three British birth cohorts over the course of their earlier working lives. We find that while educational qualifications have a strong effect on occupational attainment, this effect does not increase across the three cohorts; that class origins also have a significant effect, and one that does not decrease across the cohorts; and that features of work-life experience, in particular the frequency of occupational changes, likewise have a persisting effect, independently of both education and class origins. Secular changes in mobility processes are thus scarcely in evidence, but the analyses do provide strong indications of a cohort effect. Men in the 1958 birth cohort, whose first years in the labour market coincided with a period of severe recession, de-industrialisation and high unemployment, would appear to have experienced various lasting disadvantages in their subsequent occupational histories.

AB This article examines the role of social origins and education for career mobility in contemporary Italy by means of growth curves models. We find that opportunities for career advancement are rather limited and that risks of downward mobility are virtually negligible. Although this picture displays a noticeable degree of stability over time, a moderate increase of career fluidity across cohorts can be detected. Moreover, social origins and education exert a marked influence on the first occupation, while the subsequent career-adjustment of these initial social inequalities is rather limited. Furthermore, the small influence of origins and education on career opportunities does not display any systematic trend across cohorts.

AB On the basis of inter-cohort comparisons, this paper describes patterns of intra-generational occupational mobility in Germany and their long-term trends since World War II. It also presents conceptual links between individual mobility and developments of inequality along the life course, with a special focus on the question of the extent to which employment careers are characterised by specific forms of cumulative advantage and disadvantage. Finally, it is asked how intra-generational developments are related to inter-generational social mobility. The paper also discusses how mobility patterns can be linked to specific institutions which - together with labour market conditions - are crucial determinants of the development of inequality within a cohort. In its empirical part, the paper presents evidence from cohort-specific analyses based on life-course data from a broad range of West German birth cohorts.

AB This paper answers questions on the educational attainment and occupational career of men in The Netherlands whose working life began in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, in so far as their job history is available until at least the age of 45 years. The analysis draws on five Dutch retrospective life-history surveys conducted between 1992 and 2003. The results show that a man's education depends upon his father's job, and that this effect has not changed for labour market entry cohorts. When explaining a man's first job, his father's job is influential once more, independent of a man's education. A man's education has a direct positive effect on his first job, his job after 10 and 20 years, and his peak job, but again the differences in status attainment between labour market entry cohorts are limited. Findings also reveal that advantages accumulate during a person's working life. Apart from a higher level of education, a higher first job has an independent positive effect on a man's job after 10 and 20 years, as well as on his peak status.

AB We analyze occupational attainment and career progression over the life course for Swedish men and women, born in 1925 1974. Careers progress (measured as improvements in occupational prestige) fast during the first 5 - 10 years in the labour market, and flatten out afterwards (approximately between 30 - 40 years of age). This is in line with the occupational status maturation hypothesis. Both class origin and educational attainment affect occupational attainment. The effects of educational attainment vary more over the career, but depend on the educational attainment level in question. Successive cohorts of women gain higher occupational prestige, and continue to gain in occupational prestige longer across their careers. We also find that cohorts that entered the labour market in times of economic downturns and restructuring (the oil crisis years and the early 1990s) had more difficulties in establishing their careers. Returns to education generally increase across cohorts, while class background differences decrease, as has been reported in earlier research.

TI EDUCATION, SOCIAL ORIGINS AND CAREER (IM) MOBILITY IN CONTEMPORARY ITALY
   A holistic and categorical approach
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES

DE education; class career; social mobility; sequences; lexicographic index
AB Italy has always been characterized by low rates of career mobility. However, whilst the essential features of intragenerational (im)mobility in Italy are relatively well known, much less is known about the pattern of the specific paths linking the class of the first job with later class positions. To date, no studies of career mobility have been conducted in holistic terms; that is, based on examination of the entire sequence of the class positions occupied by an individual during his/her work history. This paper develops a typology of sequences of transition from one social class to another which preserves the qualitative differences among individual sequences. We introduce a new method to measure resemblance among sequences in order to identify the main career paths observable in Italy. We then examine how these profiles have changed over time because of transformations in the economic system and of the changing size of different social classes. Furthermore, we will try to determine whether and how social origins and education affect the probabilities of following those paths. The results show that social origins: 1) still influence the career patterns of younger cohorts); and 2) play a very important role in modifying the chances of highly-educated people to enter the upward career patterns leading to the service class or to white-collar positions.

AB Twenty years ago, Anthony Giddens proclaimed that modernity was, inherently, deeply and intrinsically sociological in the sense that sociological knowledge tended to be rapidly assimilated by individuals and institutions and therefore incorporated into subsequent processes of change. Thus, it may seem relevant to question just how much sociology is actually being put into practice in economic institutions in general and in credit institutions in particular. Drawing on fieldwork conducted in the marketing, risk, and financial departments of two Portuguese retail banks, this article describes how these institutions use specific views of society which are predominantly statistical and bear little resemblance to more qualitative sociological or anthropological accounts. Hence, there is a clear need to reconsider the problem of social reflexivity and to grasp to what extent the social sciences are still important in providing a framework for perceiving the economy and society.

AB What determines the confidence of immigrants in public institutions? Using pooled data from the European Social Survey of 26 countries, the study examines whether processes of social exclusion and discrimination can account for migrants' confidence in public institutions. Specifically, it examines the role of the quality of public institutions and of the migrant integration policies of the host country and how they interact with migrant status and proxies for experienced or potential discrimination in shaping institutional trust. Results show that the performance of public institutions matters less for the confidence of immigrants than that of natives, in particular for those who see themselves as an ethnic minority or members of a group that has faced discrimination. Second-generation migrants exhibit less trust than first-generation migrants. However, discriminatory processes appear to be of less importance than the expectations carried from the home country or acculturation processes.

AB The number of immigrants to Western Europe has been increasing, with immigration the subject of much controversy in contemporary Europe. In this article, we investigate the relationship between the size of the immigrant population, how natives perceive this size, and their anti-immigrant attitudes. We use data from the 2002/2003 European Social Survey covering 17 Western European countries, and we find that as a rule Western Europeans think that the immigrant population in their country is much larger than it actually is. The perceived size of an immigrant population has an impact on anti-immigrant prejudices, but the real size does not. Like many authors before us, we find that education reduces prejudice. However, we also find that around 10 percent of the total effect of education is a result of educated individuals' more accurate views about size of immigrant populations. In other words, the effect of education on prejudice is in part mediated by size perceptions.

AB While there is a growing body of research which explores the dramatic changes of higher education, following recent policies of widening participation and 'internationalisation', to date much of the research has focused on discrete 'non-traditional' groups. Based on qualitative data gathered from international and widening participation students, we explore the crossovers and parallels of their experiences, which is not to say that both groups are the very same. Indeed, it is the resistance to a 'fixing' positioning that this paper charts, negotiating points of sameness and difference. We suggest that there is failure to consider widening participation and internationalisation as two, intersecting, agendas, (re) producing class and race. Theoretically, such an approach offers an insight into contemporary class analysis in the context of mobility and racism, to comprehend how social divisions are complexly lived, where middle-class 'international' students may risk losing (and gaining) privilege, in (dis) similar ways to their working-class 'home' counterparts.

AB The equality agenda has gained a much higher visibility in the UK and in France. Most unions have adopted specific measures to improve women's representation in their structures. However, even in highly feminised unions, women remain under-represented in union leadership positions. To understand the gap between the presence of women in the lay membership/activist population and their slow disappearance at the higher levels of the union hierarchy, this study is focused on the role of organizational contexts. We argue that to understand the feminisation of union leadership, we need to consider the characteristics of 'internal union labour markets': ports of entry, typical/atypical career routes, norms of job evaluation, internal job segregation and hierarchy, human resources management and gender-equality policies. To fully grasp the influence of contexts on the process of feminisation, specific attention to the evolution of the repertoires of action by unions is also useful.

AB In this article, subjective work goals are studied comparatively among employees in five European countries: Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Spain, and Sweden. Inglehart (2008), West European Politics 31) has claimed that a cultural shift from survival values to self-expression values also brings changing values concerning work in advanced western societies. Inglehart's thesis is tested empirically in this article by using pooled data from World Values Surveys and European Values Studies collected in 1990-1999/2000. The results do not show a clear shift from survival values to self-expression values in work goals, which contradicts Inglehart's thesis. However, there was some support for Inglehart's claims in the data. The results also pointed to differences, as well as some similarities, between these European countries regarding work goals. Advanced western countries should not then be treated as a homogenous category in future research on work goals. The support for intrinsic work goals was also analysed using four independent variables: birth cohort, gender, social class, and job satisfaction. Social class was the main individual determinant of intrinsic work goals in most of the research countries. Higher social classes valued intrinsic work goals more than lower social classes did.

AB In this article we answered the research question to what extent variation in extrinsic and intrinsic job preference orientations can be attributed to and explained by differences between individuals and between countries. We argued that socialization in school, economic deprivation, and job quality influence job preferences, and formulated testable hypotheses on the individual and country level. After first testing for cross-national equivalence of the latent constructs and assuring that factor solutions were satisfactory, we employed multiple response multilevel models on a subset of 22 countries in the European Values Study 1999/2000. The findings indicate that higher educational attainment, a high income, working in managerial and higher professional jobs, and having autonomy in one's job stimulate intrinsic job preference orientations, while particularly educational attainment and autonomy temper extrinsic work values. Workers in semi-and unskilled manual jobs have the highest extrinsic job preferences. On top of individual characteristics, living in a nation that invests much in human capital or has a high quality labour market is associated with lower levels of extrinsic job preferences. Moreover, countries with socio-economic features that reduce the risk of economic deprivation have a more intrinsically motivated workforce.

Despite the presence of a well-established nationwide system of public employment agencies in Finland, reliance on predominantly ethnic networks was found to be pervasive among immigrants throughout their employment histories under loose as well as tight job-market conditions. The role of networks was especially vital in the immediate post-immigration period, because as newcomers to the host society, they lacked locally acquired human capital. The empirical observations also suggest, however, that extensive reliance on networks was also a means to circumvent discrimination prevailing in the labour market that discouraged immigrants from seeking employment through formal channels of job information. Discrimination had not only contributed to low occupational attainment of informants by confining them to low-prestige occupations but indirectly also may have led to the structuring of ethnically dominated networks among them. The study suggests that the efforts aimed at creating equal employment opportunities for immigrants are unlikely to bear fruit without successfully combating discrimination and a general change in attitudes towards immigrants in society.

TI AMBIVALENT CITIZENS The Alevi as the 'Authentic Self' and the
   'Stigmatized Other' of Turkish nationalism
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Turkish nationalism; Alevi; ambivalent citizenship; cultural
   nationalism; Islam
AB This paper deals with the ambivalent position of Turkish nationalism vis-a-vis the Alevi ethno-religious identity. The Alevi are the largest ethno-religious minority in Turkey. Via a critical pluralist stance, the authors argue that the debates revolving around the origins and nature of the Alevi identity disclose the cultural - and, to a lesser extent, romantic - characteristics of Turkish nationalism and its relative inability to accommodate a fully civic and pluralist notion of national identity. The paper argues that the Alevi question is one of the litmus tests that reveal Turkish nationalism's uneasiness with adopting the idea of an ethno-religiously plural society. Two hegemonic branches of Turkish nationalism conceptualize the Alevi identity through ethno-cultural and religio-cultural lenses. This leads to the Alevi being coded as 'ambivalent citizens'. This ambivalent status creates a bifurcated yet intertwined process of belonging and non-belonging, authenticity and stigmatization. The paper argues that the unremitting oscillation between the status of 'genuine self-ness' and 'heretical other-ness' discloses the very non-civic and cultural foundations of Turkish nationalism.

ID STATE
AB For more than 40 years, minorities in Poland were deprived of the opportunity to publicly voice their demands and explicitly address mounting concerns over ethnic problems. For several decades, the ethnic presence in the public arena was restricted to a folkloric and apolitical facade. This article demonstrates that the tide of change brought about by the momentous year of 1989 has opened novel opportunities for minority groups. The article's objectives are twofold. First, it examines the boundaries of the national discursive structure in the minority rights area in Poland demonstrating that it is deeply embedded in Poland's history. Second, it explores the identity of actors who contributed to the debate in the field of ethnic politics in Poland and reveals that ethnic groups and state representatives are the most active players in the game when the regulation of minorities' social and political position in contemporary Poland is at stake. The article shows that using minority language as an auxiliary one in contacts with public authorities and the issue of topographic double-naming are major sources of political contention. On the other hand, it reveals that minorities address these topics by pushing for more rights in the contentious area of the auxiliary function of ethnic languages.

AB This paper identifies classes using evidence from surveys taken in 2009 among nationally representative samples of approximately 2000 households from each of the three South Caucasus countries - Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. Information on employment, education and income is used to identify clusters of both individuals and households, in each case a middle class, a working class and a lower class. Using individual classification, the lower classes are the largest classes in each country, which therefore appear to have pyramid-shaped class structures. However, classifying households gives the class structures a diamond shape, with larger working classes than either middle classes or lower classes. The evidence shows that the main differences between classes of households lie in their standards of living, and are driven by differences in income levels. The main differences between classes of individuals are driven primarily by education, which result in differences in attitudes and (to some extent) individual lifestyles. It is argued that in economic and socio-political terms there are as yet just two real classes among actual and potential employees in the South Caucasus - middle classes and lower classes - and that although these classes differ in their standards of living and political dispositions, these are unlikely to become bases for conflict between them.

ID DIVERSE ECONOMIES; UNDECLARED WORK; LABOR-MARKETS; EMPLOYMENT;

AB This article has two main aims. The first is to problematize the dominant view of the informal economy as a sort of separate economy, related primarily to (immigrant) small business and distinct from the so-called formal economy, which for the most part encompasses big companies as well as state economic activities. In contrast, the present article assumes that all economic actors are increasingly ready to adopt informal economic strategies to secure their economical survival. In line with this assumption, the second aim of the article is to contribute to our knowledge of the causes of, as well as the actors within, the current informalization trends that characterize Western economies. The article concludes that the informalization of contemporary advanced economies in general terms is a result of a structural conflict between new economic trends and old regulatory frameworks. These frameworks, with their focus on decommodification, have become too restrictive for new forms of capital accumulation, with their focus on flexible adaptation, which include an increasing demand for the re-commodification of labour. The conflict emerges and intensifies, among other reasons, because of the radically different internal operational logics, agendas and priorities that characterize these two social processes.

AB There has been a dramatic inflow of immigrants into Ireland in recent years. Yet recent European Social Surveys indicate that Irish attitudes towards immigrants are among the most liberal in Europe. We test the association between a number of economic and cultural measures and attitudes to immigrants at the aggregate national level. Although Ireland fits the expected association and in the predicted direction the most notable feature of our results is the lack of a clear pattern between these measures and attitudes to immigrants across the European countries in the sample.

AB This article focuses on British migration to the Lot, a rural, inland department in the southwest of France. It first emphasizes the diversity among these lifestyle migrants by proposing a typology based on the position migrants occupy in the life course at the time of migration, identifying three different types of Britons living permanently in rural France: the family migrants, retirement migrants, and mid-life migrants. Each group of migrants hold in common their reasons for leaving Britain, the circumstances of their migration, and their position in the life course. The article then examines how the context of their lives before migration influences life in the Lot. In particular, it analyses the role of practical considerations in residential choice and degrees to which the migrants integrate into the local French population. By understanding the context of the migrants' lives before migration, certain aspects of their lives in the Lot are illuminated, helping to fragment stereotypes of expatriate populations and challenge the dominance of retirement migration within related literature.

AB This article analyses to what extent the incorporation of women into the labour market and their consequent economic contribution to family income affects couple's relationships. We focus particularly on Spanish couples, using a qualitative method that consists of 48 in-depth interviews of 16 couples. The partners in each couple were first interviewed together and then separately. From the analysis of the interviews, we have identified three types of dual-income couples: 'traditional', 'egalitarian' and 'false egalitarian' couples. According to our findings, these three types of couples differ in the meaning that men and women attribute to money and in the dynamics and processes related to the control and expenditure of money. Whereas for the majority of women money is linked to personal autonomy, their salaries do not automatically generate a balance between the partners. Moreover, despite social changes, gender socialisation and gender roles persist within the couple, reinforcing, for instance, the belief that men symbolically remain the main providers in dual-income couples.

AB The aim of this paper will be to analyse changes in family and gender roles in Spain within the process of individualization in the European context. The focus is thus to evaluate the extent to which institutional factors (family policies) and individual factors interact in the development of cultural models that explain differences in preferences and family and labour strategies adopted by citizens. With the objective of determining to what extent a transition process towards an egalitarian family model is being made, socio-demographic factors that explain preference groups with regard to labour and family life-styles will be analysed in two countries with very different traditions of labour and family conciliation, such as Spain and Finland. Therefore, in a second part of the work, individual factors linked to population segments identified with the egalitarian model of family roles and with the traditional model of family in Spain and Finland will be clarified. This research has highlighted the fact that a difference between family life-styles is explained by variables such as education and marital status in Spain, whereas in Finland, analyses of segmentation have underlined that age is the best variable to explain differences regarding the desired role of females.

TI THE IMPACT OF OCCUPATIONAL SEX-COMPOSITION ON WOMEN'S FERTILITY IN SPAIN
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES

DT Article
DE fertility; occupational segregation; type of employment; Spain
ID EDUCATION; EMPLOYMENT
AB This paper investigates to what extent variation in the distribution across occupational categories in the labour market affects women's demographic behaviour. It specifically explores which occupational categories are more beneficial for women in the transition to first, second and third birth in Spain. Event-history analyses are applied to retrospective data from the Spanish Fertility and Family Survey (1995). The results show that there are differences in women's fertility according to their occupational choice and demonstrate that health and teaching professionals show an advantage in harmonizing work and motherhood in Spain. This finding is consistent with the idea that not only the impact of occupational sex-segregation on women's fertility is explicable by each woman's specific attitudes towards motherhood and career but also by her employment conditions at the workplace. This effect is particularly strong in Spain due to the specific national context of combining family responsibilities and labour force participation.

AB The principle aim is to analyse care policies and mothers' employment patterns in Austria in comparison with The Netherlands and Sweden. While Sweden fosters a Universal Breadwinner Model, Austrian policies set incentives for mothers to organize private care for their children for a relatively long period of time, similar to the Caregiver Parity model. The Netherlands, approaching the Universal Caregiver model, support part-time integration into the labour market, combined with private part-time caring facilities for the children. The cross-national comparative approach has been adopted throughout the description of care policies and the data analysis, using the European Social Survey. Drawing on the strong cross-national differences in policies and employment patterns, we outline the main principles of a Universal Care Course (UCC). The model addresses questions about how to achieve the ideal of a smooth transition between work and care in a gender-sensitive way.

ID CARE; BRITAIN; GENDER
AB It is widely recognised that a work activity can be undertaken in a variety of socio-economic relations. However, the ways in which work and non-work are differentiated, or intersect, are under-specified in existing research. This article takes the social care of older people as a field through which to explore the articulation of work and non-work. It analyses the nature of the boundaries between what counts as work, and what counts as non-work; the intersections of work and non-work, and what forms this embeddedness takes; and the variation of this articulation across different European countries (Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden, and England). Three dimensions of articulation of work and non-work emerged from the analysis: (1) love or money; (2) morality versus instrumentality; and (3) from professional demarcations to embeddedness in everyday life. The article sets out how these vary by country. Overall, the research makes a general contribution to the sociology of work, and to our understanding of cross-national variation in the labour and provision of eldercare.

TI CHANGES AND CONTINUITIES IN MATERNITY POLICIES

DE maternity legislation; path dependency; Ireland; Estonia
AB This paper examines maternity policy legislation in Ireland and Estonia, focussing on changes and continuities. Throughout the paper we speak about maternity, referring to the physiological aspect of motherhood and the unique capacity of women to bear children. Very often maternity is not covered by a single policy, but it is an amalgam of various policy fields, like health, social security, and labour. These policies are all embedded in the legal framework which therefore presents a means to achieve the desired end in the society by marking the borders between the allowed and the prohibited. Even though these lines are not always followed, and may sometimes stay only on paper, they still have an impact on how the ideal state of things is perceived. They are linked to the principles upon which welfare is organised and in the case of Estonia and Ireland these have been very different. In the former, there has been the communist ideal of woman as worker and mother, and in Ireland can be seen the enduring view of woman as mother first, citizen worker second. In this paper we concentrate on the legislation since the 1920s, that is, since both countries became independent republics. We explore the critical junctures that have shaped the policy paths in both countries.

AB This paper reports the findings of a longitudinal case study of sheltered employment for activating so-called occupationally disabled people in Sweden. Data consist of interviews, archival studies and participant observation on how occupationally disabled people's employability is to be promoted and the consequences of such activities. It is argued that those that, for one reason or another, are unable to live up to the norms of being a 'normal' and hence fully active citizen, are objectified as passive and unemployable persons through the same principles that aim to make them active. Through its emphasis on ability, strength, and competence, the 'active society' may raise the bar of employability higher than ever before. As a result, an increasing number of people risk disablement and indeed end up as 'disabled'.

AB We study the relationship between two distinct dimensions of social capital (bridging and bonding social capital) and the personal performances of individuals: their reported subjective well-being (SWB) and earnings. A theoretical model is put forward which explains the sources and dynamics of social capital formation. It predicts an inverse U-shaped relationship between any type of social capital and SWB, an inverse U-shaped relationship between bridging social capital and earnings, and an unambiguously negative impact of bonding social capital on earnings. The key predictions of the model are confirmed using cross-section survey data from the 2005 wave of the 'Social Diagnosis' survey program conducted in Poland. Very low levels of bridging social capital observed in Poland imply that it is unambiguously beneficial to invest in it: both SWB of individuals and their earnings would increase in such case.

DE poverty dynamics; latent class analysis; welfare regimes; life course
ID DYNAMICS; CONSEQUENCES; STATE
AB This article complements existing life course research on poverty by looking at the typical income poverty trajectories during the first five years after experiencing a risky life event such as partnership dissolution and leaving the parental home. By broadening the time frame of research into poverty transitions, a more complete picture can be drawn of the poverty patterns related to these life events. Latent class analyses of the European Community Household Panel show that the poverty risk after experiencing a life course event is not equally large and long-lasting for everyone. Broadly, four comparable latent classes can be found across Germany, Spain, Denmark and the United Kingdom: persistent non-poor, persons with a transient - or transient-recurrent - poverty risk, persons with longer-term poverty risk and late poverty entrants. Yet, the size and occurrence of the latent classes differs between countries according to welfare regime. The article discusses country differences and social determinants of the different poverty trajectories.

DE civil society; transformation; European Union; democracy promotion; new
   member states; neo-liberalism
AB The paper examines the significance of 'civil society' promotion as a component of the new modes of governance proposed within the EU and its member states. The concept of civil society has had different meanings and roles in the evolution of the old and post-communist new EU members. 'Civil society' is analysed as a form of political coordination under capitalism; as a reform ideology in the process of opposition under communism; as a policy legitimising democratisation; and as an ideological component of neo-liberalism in the enlargement of the European Union. The paper proposes a model distinguishing the different roles played by 'civil society' discourse in the transformation of state socialism. In the post-state socialist societies a process of democracy promotion has included the sponsorship of civil society. Analysed empirically, significant differences are shown between the nature of civil society organisations in the old EU member states, new members and post socialist non-members. These data indicate the important changes which have taken place in the new member states. However, in the context of the post-socialist states, in which traditional forms of government have been weakened, there are significant structural weaknesses in civil society organisations. It is shown that there is a serious deficiency with respect to the efficacy of civil society associations as agents in the democratising process, as well as for the articulation and defence of community interests. It is argued that furthering 'civil society' forms of participation and management are a part of a neo-liberal economic and political agenda. It is concluded that strengthening democratic state forms of administration and coordination should be major policy concerns.

AB The article aims to explore Portugal's performance in some areas that can be included in a wide concept of Europeanization: the state of the economy, the rule of law, and education. It starts with a brief reference to the evolution of the Portuguese economy since the European accession to conclude that with the adoption of the single currency Portugal entered into a phase of clear economic divergence, making it an exception within the EU. Section 2 is devoted to the rule of law. It highlights how a modern and updated legal system can have an outcome that threatens some basic foundations of the rule of law, and can also contribute to increasing social inequality. The last section focuses on some problems affecting education. Particular attention is drawn to the performance of the secondary education system and to issues related to the quality of higher education institutions.

   GERMANY; VALUES; GENDER; SWEDEN; FAMILY; POLICY
AB In the public and scientific discussion on the political scope of action for improving employment opportunities for mothers, cultural aspects of female labour market participation often remain ignored. This study argues that employment decisions of mothers vary not only with the institutional settings but also with the dominant representative culture of a region. In order to study the effects of culture and institutions on maternal employment, Belgium, East, and West Germany are selected for empirical analysis. In a first step the article demonstrates that these regions differ considerably in terms of family political measures but also in terms of the cultural orientations with regard to female employment. While both Belgium and East Germany (but not West Germany) have well-developed public childcare systems for the under-3s, East Germans have a more favourable opinion towards female employment than Belgians. In a second step the study shows by means of panel analyses that these cultural differences strongly determine female employment behavior. Results indicate that both East and West German mothers have significantly higher employment probabilities in the long-run than Belgian mothers. The well-developed childcare infrastructure and the short parental leave lead only temporarily - right after childbirth - to higher employment rates among Belgian mothers. With increasing age of the child the significance of cultural dispositions result in higher overall employment probabilities among German mothers. These empirical findings support the theoretical approach of Pfau-Effinger in treating both institutional structures and culture as (equally) crucial factors in explaining cross-national differences in mothers' employment.

AB This article uses comparative micro data from the 2004 European Union Labour Force Survey (EULFS) for 23 European countries to study the impact of labour market institutions on the youth relative temporary employment probability. We find relatively high temporary employment rates for young workers in all countries but also a large cross-country variation in this respect. The results of multi-level regression analyses confirm that neither employment protection of regular contracts nor its interaction with the level of employment protection of temporary contracts affects the young people's relative risk. Instead, we find a positive association between collective bargaining coverage as a measure of insider-outsider cleavages and the relative temporary employment risk of young persons. These results remain robust even after controlling for macro-structural conditions, such as unemployment rate and business uncertainty.

AB This paper evaluates critically competing explanations for participation in undeclared work that either read engagement through a structuralist lens as driven by 'exclusion' from state benefits and the circuits of the modern economy or through a neo-liberal and/or post-structuralist lens as driven by the voluntary 'exit' of workers out of formal institutions. Reporting a 2005/6 household work practices survey involving 313 face-to-face interviews in contemporary Moscow, the finding is that there is no single unique logic underpinning undeclared work in this post-Soviet city; such work is neither universally driven by exclusion nor exit. Different mixtures of the two prevail across different populations and forms of undeclared work. The outcome is a call for greater appreciation of the multifarious character of undeclared work and a move beyond simplistic explanations and policy responses.

AB This study examines the connection between the time that women and men spend on paid work and housework and psychological distress, and addresses the question whether gender differences in time spent on these activities account for the gender difference in psychological distress. A group (n =1,277) of employed and cohabiting women and men from the Swedish Level-of-Living Survey 2000 (LNU 2000) are analysed using OLS regression. Results show that time spent on housework explains part of the gender difference in psychological distress. Among women, paid working time and possibly time spent on housework are associated with low psychological distress. However, spending too much time on one role decreases the possible beneficial effect of the other, and this is mainly caused by the resulting increase in total role time. Men's level of psychological distress is not associated with hours of paid work or housework. The study also shows that the division of housework between women and men is unusually uneven in households where women have a long total role time. Thus, an increase in men's participation in housework could decrease the gender difference in psychological distress as well as the number of women experiencing a high workload.

AB In this interview with Shmuel Noah Eisenstadt, the author discusses with the great sociologist of civilizations the intellectual influences on his writings, and his progress since his early works on Israeli society. Eisenstadt analyzes multiple 'modernities' in the context of European society and the salience of solidarity and trust. One of the Axial Age civilizations that continues to fascinate Eisenstadt is India, the largest democracy in the world. Eisenstadt points out that Christianity, Islam, Confucianism, and other civilizations and empires are both universalistic, and particularistic and exclusive. Following his relatively recent analysis of Weber's Ancient Judaism, he prefers to relate to Judaism as a civilization rather than an ethnic group, nation, religion or people, and finds it useful to understand the development of modern Israeli society. He foresees both a constructive and destructive global future, and reiterates his belief in sociology as a powerful tool to present an analysis which can enrich public discussion.

SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE post-materialism; Greens; left-right; democracy; congruence
AB Among other social and political changes, post-materialist theory anticipated the need to strengthen democracy in political institutions in post-industrial societies. This change in political values would mean that in addition to growth in post-materialist values, parties would be pushed to take an alternative view of politics that would entail greater assimilation of democratic procedures. This paper partially and empirically tests the validity of this explanation in four European party systems. The Greens are the focus, since they are considered the parties that best fit the post-materialist profile. In particular, the paper aims to ascertain whether the Greens display a significantly better positioning in respect to support for democracy and the congruence of their voters than other parties, as theory leads us to believe. The explanation of higher levels of party congruence is also expected to be related to post-materialist party features. The findings of this research did not show enough evidence to validate our theoretical expectations.

AB The question of workplace participation opportunities and limitations in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has gained momentum in sociological debates in Germany over the last years. Against the background of fundamental changes in the German industrial relations system, sociological research on this topic has shifted its focus from indirect to direct participation. On this basis, the paper aims to analyse and discuss the panoply of participation practices in an economic cluster in the region of Dortmund, a town in the German Ruhr Valley. The paper starts with an introduction of the empirical case, the development of the high-technology microsystems cluster in Dortmund, and gives an overview of the relevant private enterprises on the basis of three different company types. We go on to discuss the practice-orientated approach of participation which we combine with relevant sociological research results about direct and indirect participation as well as human resource management in SMEs and the New Economy. After a short overview of the methodological and empirical background of our research, we discuss the existing practices and cultures belonging to and surrounding direct and indirect participation with regard to the three types of businesses in the Dortmund cluster. The correlation between participation practices and business types is, however, not sufficient to fully describe the situation. The concept of participation cultures is therefore used as an additional concept.

AB This paper focuses on the research question 'Who does not vote and why?' regarding national elections in 24 European countries. We analyse determinants of non-voting both on the individual and the societal level employing a multilevel design. On the micro level, the sociological determinants under consideration are education, cohort and gender. Regarding psychological or motivational factors, we include in the analyses political efficacy, political interest, political trust and satisfaction with politics. On the macro level, we analyse characteristics of the electoral system, including opportunities for 'direct democracy', maturity of democracy, disproportionality factor, and if the participation in elections is compulsory. The data source of the analyses is the European Social Survey 2006. A first main finding is the fact that the probability of non-voting is higher among people with a low level of education and among younger cohorts. The motivational factors have similar impacts on non-voting across all analysed societies. Lack of political efficacy, lack of political interest, lack of political trust and dissatisfaction with politicians and the political system increase the probability of non-voting. Regarding macro influences, countries with compulsory voting and 'old democracies' turn out to have a lower rate of non-voting, although these effects vanish when simultaneously modelled with the social psychological micro level indicators.

AB This article examines the Race Equality Directive (RED) and its transposition in the context of a new European Union (EU) member state, Baltic Lithuania. Taking this post-communist society as a case study, it is suggested that while formal legislative compliance with the RED has been broadly attained, transposed anti-discrimination legislation and national policy implementation initiatives may not adequately take into account societal attitudes and norms. The historical legacy of Soviet times, the contemporary post-communist experience, and the current economic crisis have resulted in a fragile national identity and a propensity towards populist and even xenophobic responses to uncertainty. These factors are explored in terms of their potential for undermining the objectives of EU-derived legislation designed to promote racial and ethnic tolerance. The article concludes that while a 'differentiated' Europeanisation has not occurred in formal terms, the possibility exists of 'differential' Europeanisation emerging in post-communist new EU member states such as Lithuania.

ID IDENTITY; CURRICULUM; TEACHERS; BRITAIN
AB Comparisons of public opinion in England and Germany consistently show higher levels of attachment to Europe and support for European integration in Germany. The respective cross-national differences are empirically well-documented, can be framed in plausible macro-contextual explanations, and are - on the descriptive level - confirmed in the present survey of Berlin and London state secondary school head teachers. However, in view of such conclusive evidence, it is easy to overlook cross-national convergences pertaining to people's individual experiences and perceptions. This article offers an alternative view on empirically well-documented and theoretically plausible cross-national differences in levels of attachment to Europe, with a particular interest in the field of formal education. Drawing on a series of multivariate statistical analyses, it demonstrates that - in Berlin as well as in London - levels of attachment to Europe largely depend on the head teachers' intercultural experiences and skills as well as their notions of Europe as object of attachment. The respective findings lend support to educational programmes and initiatives that promote intercultural experiences and skills as means towards further European integration.

AB In view of the steady growth in life expectancy in recent decades the question is increasingly being raised whether and how older people should be encouraged to be more active, and particularly to engage in unpaid voluntary work. Taking adult life as a whole the conditions for such charitable involvement would appear to be especially favourable after retirement. However, these analyses, which are based on German longitudinal data, show that the effect of entering retirement is often exaggerated. Rather, the individual's previous volunteering experiences are of major importance in his decision to take up and continue voluntary work in later life. At the same time the analyses show how important the major resources of health and education are, particularly for participation in voluntary work during ageing.

AB This article evaluates the relationship between welfare state institutions and informal voluntary activity. In particular, we wish to investigate the extent to which welfare state arrangements influence the individual's decision to volunteer informally. Focusing on informal volunteering - a vital, yet often neglected form of social capital - we reinvestigate the hypotheses on crowding in and crowding out. Our sub-national multilevel analysis of the Swiss cantons reveals that there is no significant effect of welfare statism on informal volunteering. Cantonal differences in individual propensity to volunteer informally can rather be attributed to different cultural-linguistic backgrounds as well as to the cantonal degree of urbanisation.

DE transformation; social quality; agency; Russia; Belarus; Ukraine
AB This paper looks at the impact of the economic collapse of the former Soviet Union on the lives of ordinary people in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus using qualitative as well as quantitative data. We argue that to understand the impact of the transformation it is necessary to take a sociological approach. To provide a framework for our analysis we use the Social Quality model which enables us to consider the recursive relation between agency and structure and social and systems integration. We draw upon a sample survey of 8,400 individuals carried out in 2001 together with qualitative interviews with a purposefully selected sample of individuals, health experts and focus groups conducted in 2002. The use of qualitative data enables us to look beyond classifying variables to experience. We conclude that the collapse has not only resulted in a decline in the material circumstances of households but also on social integration, social cohesion and the ability of people to take control over their own lives.

TI CAN WE IDENTIFY INTERGENERATIONAL POLICY REGIMES IN EUROPE?

AB This paper examines whether it is possible to recognise specific patterns of institutionally regulated downward (towards children) and upward (towards the old) intergenerational obligations with regard to care and financial support, and to identify specific country profiles and clusters of countries in Europe. Based on the three-fold conceptualisation of familialism by default, supported familialism and de-familialisation, and using a complex set of indicators, we describe how countries, by means of policies, allocate intergenerational responsibilities between families and the state, also paying attention to their gender impact. The study includes all 27 EU countries and for the first time offers a comparative overview of a diversified set of policies with regard to both children and the old. It concludes that although specific policy profiles emerge with regard to the two sets of obligations, these do not always coincide. Furthermore, contrary to widespread opinion, supported familialism and de-familialisation are not always contrasting policy approaches. In some countries, they actually represent part of an integrated approach to public support of intergenerational obligations. Moreover, the gender impact of supported familialism may be different and even contrary, depending on the specific instrument. Finally, once the road of oversimplification is excluded, only one statistically sound cluster of countries emerges. It is, however, possible to detect groups of countries that are similar. These only partly overlap with prevalent welfare regime types.

ID SUPPORT NETWORKS; WEAK TIES; COMMUNITY; CONTEXT; AGE
AB The process generally referred to as 'the transition' implied a complex set of social changes in Central and Eastern European countries (CEE). On the one hand, there were institutional reforms which were launched to abolish the socialist economic and political systems. On the other hand, the provision of welfare was also affected by 'transition'. The change could be observed at the institutional level (i.e., through the welfare state) as well as at the social and individual level - in the ways individuals associated, how they perceived new risks and with whom they engaged to confront them. In this article we focus on social support provision from informal sources, i.e., ego-centered social support networks, which are an important foundation for the quality of everyday life. We would like to find out whether changes in the socio-economic system are reflected in and accompanied by changes in social support providers. How have people responded to transition? Did the patterns of support and social support providers change in this period? Consequently, the research question addressed in this article is the following: do the current types of social networks differ from those in the 1980s? We try to answer it by analyzing and comparing the data on social support networks in 1987 and 2002. The data are interpreted in the context of the transition that was happening in Slovenia at the time.

DE citizenship; marketisation; privatisation; flows of resources
ID GENDER PENSION GAPS; STATE; POLITICS; POLICY; TRANSFORMATION; LIFE
AB Starting in the 1980s and 1990s, in various European welfare reforms, parts of the social insurance systems and the related resources were transferred to the financial market. In this sense, one can speak of privatisation and marketisation, both examples of a neo-liberal tendency. Now, after 'the Fall of Finance Capitalism', it is often stated that 'the years of neoliberal triumph have come to an end'. This paper argues that there had already been a contrasting and powerful development previously, which might now be reinforced. This political and institutional development was moving towards extensive regulatory policies, in particular after the stock market crisis in 2001, and towards solidarity, two examples of a neo-etatistic tendency. I argue that the traditional exclusionary categorisation significantly underestimates the continuously changing mix. I will introduce a more complex approach which will be much more helpful to comprehend current developments in pension protection, and which might also be considered for providing an understanding of change in social protection schemes and welfare states in general. To my view, current changes in capitalist welfare societies are system-inherent substantiations of complexly intertwined dynamics, which can be comprehended by analysing changes in flows of resources and in the rights over these resources. These changes are manifest in what is termed social citizenship. Consequently, I will come to the conclusion that the observed changes promote new forms of social citizenship.

ID INDIVIDUALIZATION; GENDER; TRENDS
AB This paper maps the unequal development of detraditionalization in rich societies. It views detraditionalization as a shift in the mode of social control from reliance on scarcity, belief and ideology, self evident tradition and obedience, to self-control. Self-control is based upon belief in an autonomously choosing subject (individualism) and a set of institutional conditions able to guide the choices of the individuals (such as education, mass media, the world of goods, and therapy). This paper investigates the relationship between detraditionalization and the rise of such an individualist conception of the self. It shows that such a development cannot be understood in terms of individual detraditionalization, i.e., as a shift in personal attitudes, but is related to specific institutional developments, in casu the development of the psi-disciplines and the therapeutization of society. The persistent influence of Protestant tradition on the individualist conception of the self in strongly secularized societies is explained by the same institutional development.
