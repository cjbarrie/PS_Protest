TI Lost in translation. Institutional traps and unexpected effects
   hampering innovation in Italian LTC policies
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article; Early Access
DE Long-term care policy; Italy; home care premium; implementation; local
   discretion; take-up
AB Despite its growing care needs, Italy has inertially reproduced its consolidated LTC system, dominated by institutional fragmentation, lack of in-kind services, and resulted in public policies which consist of unconditional cash benefits. This structure has encouraged family-based care arrangements (with gender inequalities) and created a large private care market which is dependent on irregular recruitment of migrant care workers employed by families.
   In 2012 an innovative LTC scheme dubbed, 'Home Care Premium' (HCP), was introduced as a new experimental programme (limited to public employees and their relatives) addressing the Italian LTC system's problematic features. It provided people in need of care with two benefits using a complex multilevel provision system. This article focuses on the 2014 HCP version, analyses its implementation and reflects critically on the problems undermining the innovation dynamic. In particular, the high degree of local discretion emerging in the programme's implementation and the low take-up among the potential beneficiaries compared to what expected will be considered. These results allow a better understanding of institutional traps and unexpected effects hampering innovation even when the reform is perfectly designed.

DE Testimony; violence naturalisation; everyday life; performativity;
   asymmetric use of force
AB This article addresses the relevance of Israeli soldier narrations in which they bear witness to human agency under conflict and adversity to call for the end of the occupation of the Palestinian territories. The soldiers, members of the NGO Breaking the Silence, speak up about the occupation, showing the conflicting experiences of military and civilian life in a society that normalises the denial of military human rights violations. By asking Israeli society to listen to their stories, the soldiers' accounts show how the historic military power in the Occupied Palestine Territories (OPT) has evolved into a naturalisation of violence that generates a radical configuration of intractability, which has transformed the perception and meaning of violence. By framing the soldiers' accounts in the space fragmentation and securitisation practices, the article argues how the asymmetrical use of force is exerted to manage and control the lives of the Palestinian population. The speech act addresses the ethics of doing something to make a difference in the conflict and the wish to renew social bonds, redefine pride and shame and return a sense of honour, loyalty and self-respect.

AB This systematic literature review aimed to synthesise the studies conducted between 2008 and 2018 on the different influencing factors of post-retirement work. We followed the methodological suggestions proposed by [Petticrew, M., & Roberts, H. (2006). Systematic reviews in the social sciences: A practical guide. John Wiley & Sons] for the development of a systematic review in the Social Sciences. Seven electronic databases were searched and a total of 32 studies were included. We differentiated between the following categories of influencing factors of post-retirement work: Socio-demographic, implicit, work-related, and life-related factors. On the one hand, our results revealed that studies on the socio-demographic and life-related factors presented inconsistent, inconclusive, or limited levels of evidence on how they influence post-retirement work across countries. On the other hand, the implicit and work-related factors showed more consistent levels of evidence regarding their influencing effects. Thus, this study provides further insight into which multidimensional factors are most likely to increase older workers' willingness towards engaging in post-retirement work.

AB Using in-depth interviews with six educated fathers whose wives were pregnant at the time of the study, the present research aims to interrogate how their preferences in pregnancy services have been developed and avidly exercised using their sets of cultural capital. Following the presented research analysis, the theorizing of education as cultural capital by Pierre Bourdieu allows the author to further explore the complexity of the relationship between medical service preferences and facilities with the respondents' social status as educated middle class actors. Moreover, access to and enjoyment in using the medical facilities and services of this private hospital is a social symbol desired by the respondents in order to reinforce and reinvigorate their social status. In addition, hospitals as providers of medical facilities and services play a role in accommodating the process of cultural capital activities of these highly educated expectant fathers. The inclusion of private hospitals in this study should also be considered as a symbol of social inequality in the provision of health services in Indonesia. The respondents place themselves within everyday social interactions, that relate naturally to the world, and represent the preoccupied active presence through which the world imposes its presence.

LA English
DT Article
DE Marketisation; non-profit; civil society; concept analysis
AB It is, today, widely accepted that market structures, logics, identities and activities are spreading throughout society, including civil society and its organisations. Scholars increasingly use the marketisation concept to describe these tendencies. This paper reviews the meaning attached to this concept, when used in the context of civil society. A sample of 210 peer-reviewed articles in civil society studies published between 1993 and 2017 is explored in an analysis that suggests that marketisation is being used with much variation in the literature. The analysis also shows that apart from more generic descriptions of persistent attempts to privatise and commodify various goods and services, few articles seem to involve more detailed definitions or profound conceptual arguments. Taken together, this indicates a development where the concept of marketisation runs the risk of losing its analytical powers. To avoid this, the paper proposes a stricter and more transparent use of the term 'marketisation' and suggests ways to further develop this concept in research.

AB The current study presents the longitudinal overview of 40 years of Luhmannian research in the Anglophone academic community by employing a quantitative content analysis. As the first study of this kind, this paper aims to explore the current topography of Luhmannian research. For the purpose, a total of 1,231 journal articles published in English were analyzed in terms of the number of articles in relation to several variables such as publication year, region, discipline, methodology, and the purpose of utilizing Luhmann. In summary, the key findings include: first, decreasing Anglo-American authors' contributions to the Luhmannian research in the English-language academic publications, as opposed to growing outputs of authors from continental Europe and other regions; second, the difference in the maturity of Luhmannian scholarship by region; third, the demonstration of the breadth and versatility of Luhmann's theory of systems; fourth, the capability of Luhmann's theory accommodating empirical research and its potential as a framework to lead fruitful research streams. This study is expected to provide a useful reference for Luhmannian researchers, as well as for authors from other research strands.

AB Three sociological theories are presented (Labeling Theory, Marxist Theory, and Conflict Theory) as a means of contextualizing the effects of residential segregation. Borrowing from the works of two legal-constitutional scholars, John Hart Ely ([1980]. Democracy and distrust: A theory of judicial review. Harvard University Press.) and Ronald Dworkin ([1978]. Taking rights seriously. Harvard University Press.), an attempt is made to integrate sociological and legal theories in explaining the historical antecedents of residential segregation in a democratic society. The basic questions posed are: What role has the legal system played in residential segregation in the United States? How can sociological and legal theories help illuminate the condition? Synthesizing sociological and legal theories that have complementary features may provide deeper insights into the complex nature of residential segregation in contemporary society.

Through the investigation of a vast empirical, theoretical literature and critical thinking on the directions taken by research, the distinctive features and the complexity of violence against women are pointed out. Variable in terms of impact and form, violence against women is a feature not only present in widely-differing geo-cultural realities but also persistent and showing a polymorphic, transverse character related to male dominance which enables it (until now) to survive many social and legislative changes. As well as identifying the particular features and changing forms of this type of violence, quite unlike any other, the essay stresses the adaptive, endemic and persistent character of this phenomenon and highlights above all its intimate and political matrix.

AB To understand the content and the historical forms of violence, it is necessary to define it in relation to the different notions that dot its path of meaning (power, domination, strenght, order, sovereignty, etc.). Moreover, this allows us to grasp its new configurations connected to the systemic upheavals that characterize the globalised world. In contemporary society violence now shows a double face, which is a combination of renewed forms of traditional violence and 'new' forms that derive from processes of social differentiation. These 'new' forms of systemic-molecular violence are linked to a biotechnological domain that opens up a new scenario to the possibility of violating freedoms and rights in the globalised world.

DE Violence and social change; cultural and social dimensions; identity and

AB The essay addresses some perspectives of analysis, elaborated and established over the past 30 years, highlighting both the cultural complexity and the multidimensionality of violence in contemporary society. In the age of globalization, the focus of the reflections is found within the relationship between violence and identity and its transformation. Concerning the relationship between violence and identity, the essay addresses the nuclear issue of the similarity between logics and practices of identity construction and logics and practices of violent action against diversity and otherness. Particular attention is given to bodily violence and social realities that are still defined as violent today due to the cultural differences between societies, individuals and groups of individuals. The main references are G. Balandier, P. Bourdieu, J. Galtung, P. Former, M. Wieviorka, R. Collins and A. Appadurai. The different conceptual definitions of violence that is direct or cultural violence, institutional or subjective, structural or symbolic, genocidal or civicidarian violence are therefore addressed in an attempt to use them to re-read phenomena and the socio-cultural dimension of violence.

DT Article
DE neutral violence; technique; mono(a)theistic state; zootechnical policy
AB There is a dimension of violence internal to the functioning logic of technical systems and within the transparency of the instrumental vision of technology. Yet it is one of the centres of rotation of the mobile geography of global violence. This article aims to highlight this centre of mobilization of contemporary violence by identifying the neutral character of technical violence. Technical neutrality, being an instrumental field of operation, qualifies only on the basis of the qualities of meaning that move the action of violent subjects, be they individual or collective. In fact, each violent subject uses technologies to enhance the act of violation in order to impose a sense of his order of reality in the victim's sphere of life. However, it is precisely by serving the various ends that qualify the omnipotence of the violent subject that the technique systematically becomes their master. This reversal of the means-ends relationship is one of the accelerating factors of the innovation cycles of the forms of technical violence towards increasingly sophisticated and pervasive degrees. Moving in this problematic context, the article aims to understand how the technical metamorphoses of violence reconfigure the contemporary social bond as well as human identity.

ID REVOLUTIONARY SITUATION; CITIZENSHIP; TENSIONS; MAOISTS
AB This paper aims to unravel the changing forms of violence encountered by the 'tribal' or Adivasi communities of eastern India from the nineteenth century till the present times. The very identification of particular communities as 'tribes' and the imposition of attributes of tribalism, such as primitivity, and childlike innocence, by British colonial writers constituted an epistemic violence, the psychological impact of which persists to this day. The resultant infantilizing of Adivasis divested them of their own agency and effectively transformed their representation from perpetrators to victims of violence, oppression and displacement. After Independence, this notion of victimhood was appropriated both by the post-colonial state which reserved for itself the role of the redeemer/ provider, as well as by Adivasi communities who thus sought to reshape their community identity in their fight for indigenous rights. However, Adivasis continue to suffer from an easy misrepresentation of their role and status, figuring very often as dangerous insurgents who threaten national security or as backward minorities whose survival hinders development. This paper demonstrates the increasing exposure of Adivasi communities to 'slow violence' and to 'everyday forms of violence' whereby they are progressively dispossessed of their livelihood and cultural heritage.

AB Using data from a 2008 nationwide survey in China, this study explores the relationship of perceived local-level corruption to government trust in an established authoritarian regime. With nearly two thirds of respondents considering cadre corruption to be a 'serious problem,' the authors find that perceptions of serious corruption are significantly and negatively related to trust in officials at all levels of government, including the central level. Contrary to extant findings that the Center is shielded from blame for well-intended policies that fail, the findings of this study suggest that when it comes to assigning blame for continued corruption, Chinese citizens - and especially urban Chinese - do not let Central officials off scot-free. Pushing further in an attempt to understand why some urban Chinese citizens seemingly hold the central government partly responsible for cadre corruption while others do not, analyses cast the spotlight on the level of education. As anticipated, education level is by itself negatively related to trust in the central government, but there is also unexpected evidence that among urbanites who perceive corruption to be a serious problem, it is actually the most highly educated who are most trusting.

DE Marital status; life satisfaction; social inclusion; path model
ID HAPPINESS; FAMILY
AB Our study examines the relationship between social inclusion and the marital status of individuals. The family is interpreted as an integration-based institution affecting satisfaction. Through the interpretation of the integration function of the family, we examine whether the individuals' life satisfaction is determined by their current marital status and what factors influence and explain the satisfaction with life in a post-socialist country a quarter of a century after the change of regime. Indeed, life satisfaction is one of the strongest social inclusion factors, so in our analysis, we seek to find out whether the different forms of coexistence (marriage, partnership, widowhood, divorced marital status) influence the level of satisfaction of individuals and what gender and other demographic and environmental features determine this the most. The study employs the database from the 'Integration and disintegration processes in Hungarian society' research. The sample contains 2687 people. The sample is nationally representative of gender, age, educational background, type of settlement, and region. The survey was made in 2015 with the support of OTKA (Hungarian Scientific Research Fund Programs). Through our path model analyses, we have proved that in society in Hungary the current marital status of individuals does not affect their satisfaction with life; rather, it is the quality of the cooperative spaces people live in, that is, primarily, the quality of their family relationships and their immediate living environment, and as a weaker but measurable impact, their subjectively perceived personal social prestige that does.

The starting point is an earlier work circumscribed to Brazil, which found that the weight of schooling had declined relative to the amount of income in recent decades, especially for groups with intermediate levels of education. In the present article, we analyze the trends for a set of six countries, central and peripheral. The main finding is that the trend of a decline in the weight of schooling, especially for groups with intermediate levels of education, is seen in all the countries.

AB Recent evidence suggests that popular disaffection with liberal-democratic norms and institutions has been growing in different regions of the world, but studying the social origins of democratic versus authoritarian political preferences are especially relevant in countries with immature democratic practices. The main concern of this article is the association between intergenerational social mobility and support for democracy in post-socialist societies. I present a theoretical framework in which individuals' political attitudes are affected by their intergenerational social mobility experiences. I model this theoretical argument using two complementary data-sets and various multivariable and multilevel statistical techniques. The results indicate that intergenerational social mobility, particularly its subjective perception, has statistically significant links with attitudes towards democracy and that this association is moderated by the attained level of democracy in the country where an individual resides. This may suggest that studying social origins of support for democracy by means of intergenerational social mobility can be an important tool to understand the conundrum of democratisation and democratic backsliding in post-socialist societies.

DT Article
DE Multi-paradigmatic sociology; paradigmatic integration; social
   interaction concept; new paradigmatic potentials
AB This article is a continuation of the debate on the paradigmatic foundations of sociology. The argument reads that any negligence towards the rising number of would-be sociological paradigms stands as counter-productive to sociological theorizing and empirical research. The guiding idea here is that while sociology is a multi-paradigmatic discipline, efforts should still be made to develop paradigmatic syntheses. The suggested direction for resolving this task includes building up an integrative paradigmatic model and discussing its content and applications. The core of this model is the broadly defined concept of social interaction at micro, meso and macro levels of social structures and processes. The suggested paradigm has the capacity to efficiently mediate in overcoming dilemmas regarding sociological knowledge by integrating structural and historical approaches as well as balancing the explanatory potential of material factors and ideas. In this way, prospects will open up for the development and application of explanatory models in addition to quality middle-range theories.

AB In recent years, 'intellectual decolonisation' has become so popular in the Global North that we can now speak of there being a 'decolonial bandwagon'. This article identifies some of the common limitations that can be found in this growing field of intellectual decolonisation. First and foremost, it is suggested that intellectual decolonisation in the Global North may be characterised by Northerncentrism due to the way in which decolonial scholarship may ignore decolonial scholars from the Global South. In order to address this 'decolonisation without decolonising', this article offers an alternative genealogy of intellectual decolonisation by discussing some of the most important yet neglected decolonial theory from the Global South. Thereafter, five other common limitations which may appear in discussions about intellectual decolonisation are identified, which are: reducing intellectual decolonisation to a simple task; essentialising and appropriating the Global South; overlooking the multifaceted nature of marginalisation in academia; nativism; and tokenism. The objective of this article is to highlight common limitations which may be present in discussions about intellectual decolonisation so as to provide a warning that some manifestations of intellectual decolonisation may not only be inadequate but may even reinscribe coloniality.

AB Compared to racist and ethnicist discourses, literature on sexist discourses - both off and on-line - as hate speech is relatively underinvestigated. This is partly due to the tendency to minimise accusations of sexism and to reframe misogyny as 'acceptable' by constructing it as a form of humour. We decided to focus on slut-shaming, one of the most virulent forms of hate speech, which has always existed but was boosted by social media, becoming a stable low-cost ingredient of today's rape culture. We propose to consider online slut-shaming as a form of 'technology-facilitated sexual violence', where digital technologies are used to facilitate both virtual and face-to-face sexually based harms. According to feminist analysis of sexual violence, this would be a matter of power rather than sex: sex would be the weapon, not the motive. We have tested this research hypothesis by focusing on the Italian reception of the MeToo campaign, triggered by Asia Argento's denunciation. More specifically, two Different Twitter corpora produced within the same five months period were examined by means of a quantitative and a qualitative methodology.

DE Immigration; immigrant; refugee; social networks; linguistic analysis
AB The phenomenon of immigration has been studied from diverse perspectives. It is important to note that immigration is common during times of crisis. The reason for the avalanche of immigrants to the Canary Islands (Spain) is because it is the gateway to Europe, and therefore, immigrants wanted to enter from this point. This research is based on the need to linguistically determine the treatment of the phenomenon of immigration in the Spanish press. This analysis is relevant given the arrival of thousands of foreign citizens to the coast of the Canary Islands, first in 2006 and almost a decade later, in 2015 to the south of Europe in another great population movement. This research attempts to study four Spanish newspapers, two from the Canary Islands (El Dia and Canarias 7) and two Spanish mainland national newspapers (El Pais and ABC), the online version of the newspapers and their websites were analyzed beside one of the most important social networks, Twitter. The role of incorporating social networks to immigration discourse is also analyzed. To support the data analysis of this research, the Iramuteq software was used.

DE Gender; International Review of Sociology; lexicometric analysis;

AB The Social Sciences and, specifically, the sociological research, have progressively assumed the gender factor as one of the strategic keys to understand contemporary phenomena. In fact, as a variable for socio-statistical analysis or as a characterizing trait of individual identity, it is a decisive factor in the interpretation of the deep social transformations, and it inspires the self-reflection of the sociologists about the analytical tools of their discipline. The contribution proposes, through a lexicometric approach, an analysis of the articles published in the last two decades by the oldest journal of Sociology, published by Routledge. The main aim is to highlight the different ways in which gender issues are declined in the international sociological researches presented in the repertoire of the International Review of Sociology and to outline, both on the lexical level and on the topic level, the changes occurred over time.

AB The mediatization of emotions emerges as an affordance of social media, the study of which involves paying attention to digital practices and to the construction and expression of public affection. This happens both for the great events and for the daily demonstrations of support or its denial. In this article we work on the phenomenon of the mediatization of emotions linked to two LGBTQI+ icons and expressed in hashtags on Twitter. Placing it in a specific context - the one of well-known television characters who have declared their homosexual orientation or transgender identity. The objective is to understand if the cloud of feelings they have created on Twitter is to be attributed to a true globally mediatized emotional exchange, or just an expression of emotions on the social media, and discover which emotional dynamics, linked to the LGBTQI+ world, they express.

ID COLLECTIVE MEMORY; LABOR MIGRANTS; RIGHTS; IMMIGRATION; DISCOURSE;
   CRIME; DEPORTABILITY; CITIZENSHIP; MANAGEMENT; DETENTION
AB This article analyzes the discursive process of criminalization of African asylum seekers in Israel. The Israeli case illuminates the way that marginalized social groups are constructed as a criminal threat, thus becoming a focal point of moral panic. Using content analysis, in-depth interviews and observations, we assert that the criminalization of asylum seekers is facilitated by their portrayal as 'infiltrators' who are beyond state control. State authorities' ostensible inability to keep asylum seekers under surveillance is dialectically constructed along two main axes: the private space axis and the public space axis. On the private space axis, the asylum seekers are portrayed as unidentified people living beyond the authorities' field of vision whose largely unreported criminality is directed against vulnerable asylum seeker women and children in the private sphere. At the same time, asylum seekers are portrayed as a prominent, faceless and animalistic presence in public space, a presence that breaches physical-spatial borders as well as social-cultural boundaries, thereby undermining the social order. Thus, asylum seekers are viewed as conspicuously invisible. This rhetoric connects border violation with criminal activity; emphasizes the pent-up potential for violence by asylum seekers; and blurs the lines between criminal threat and security threat.

DE Teacher education; teacher professionalization; education politics;

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB This article highlights the ideational factors underpinning the movements to professionalize teachers in the United-States and in France. It demonstrates that the deep driving force behind these movements is neither the modernization of schooling, nor the professional interests of teacher educators, but the politico-cultural hold of a philosophical paradigm that met the values and ideals of education and political systems' actors. By associating human progress with social progress based on natural laws, the naturalistic standpoint of this philosophical paradigm won the favor of the times. Nevertheless, the adaptive conception of intellectual and moral development it supports entails a separation of the mental world of education specialists from that of academic scholars. As a consequence, the major missions of formal education shifted from the training of the mind through the understanding of subject-matters to that of whole social personalities through situated or experiential forms of understanding, the paradoxical outcome being a loss of teachers' autonomy in terms of professional expertise.

DE Call centres; job satisfaction; labour market regulation; working

ID WORK; QUALITY; CONSEQUENCES; FLEXIBILITY; STRESS; VALUES; STAFF
AB The article examines job satisfaction in 21 Italian call centres. The results of research carried out on 1715 handlers indicate how dissatisfaction prevails among call centre representatives (CCRs) and how it is influenced by aspects related to some organisational characteristics (service delivered, size and organisational typology), on one side, and to different aspects of working conditions (contract, wage and tenure) and participants' biographical and working profiles of CCRs (gender, age, educational attainment), on the others. However, the most interesting finding emerges by distinguishing different dimensions of job satisfaction (extrinsic and intrinsic-relational). In particular, the relationship between type of contract and job satisfaction is rather interesting. For non-permanent workers, in fact, the probability of being dissatisfied is decidedly greater if we consider the extrinsic dimension of job satisfaction. Instead, when the intrinsic-relational dimension is taking into account, atypical workers are no more dissatisfied than the permanent ones. Job insecurity and limited perspectives in terms of work alternatives, safeguards and rewards, seem to be the source of greatest dissatisfaction for Italian CCRs. This certainly does not surprise considering the Italian development model and its dualistic labour market, highly segmented between insiders and outsiders.

AB This paper uses a large-scale national survey of students who completed a three-year degree between 2004 and 2010 to analyse the employment found by sociology graduates in Italy. We especially focus on graduates working in the research sector that, while representing the ?future? of the discipline, are facing major employment challenges, due to the problems both the public and private italian research industries are grappling with. The analysis explored various aspects of this subpopulation. Firstly, it investigated whether graduates in research differ from other groups in terms of their social backgrounds and/or previous education pathways. Secondly, the employment found by such people was examined, looking at the contractual terms, the nature of the work being done, the skills required and the contribution provided by their learning pathways. The result is a detailed picture of graduates employed in the research sector, that shows critical elements (job insecurity, low pay and several deficiencies in the education received) along with positive ones (a significant use of the skills acquired and a general sense of job satisfaction). The conclusion seeks to translate these results into practical policy considerations for training future researchers in sociology.

The main contribution of this article is to highlight three distinctive trajectories of welfare financialisation. Two key issues of this emerging debate are mainly examined. First, one delineates the relationship between social policy and financial market. Second, one addresses the institutional mechanisms created to solve the problem of finding alternative resources to public expenditure, by offering a new perspective on how welfare financialisation interacts with private debt circuits and public spending.

The Swedish youth councils are the responsibility of local authorities and they are designed to encourage political and civic interests among young people. These councils administrated by local bureaucracies are analyzed using institutional logics theory to determine the intentions, organization and outcomes of youth participation. The conclusions show that the institutional logic of the local public administration tends to dominate over the democratic logic of political participation for the young. The findings are based on mainly qualitative data from a two-year research project in Sweden.

AB We develop a secondary analysis of the data by the Italian National Statistical Institute (ISTAT) by means of two surveys on large samples of PhD graduates who obtained their doctoral degrees from Italian universities in 2004 and 2006 (the first survey) and in 2008 and 2010 (the second survey). We focused on doctorate holders in the political and social sciences. After a descriptive social make-up of the four cohorts, we carried out an analysis to verify the mid-term occupational outcomes of these graduates during a period of academic reforms and economic crisis in Italy. Our analysis underlines relevant differences between the two cohorts of PhD holders that graduated before the economic crisis and the two cohorts that graduated after. The latter have higher chances of obtaining fixed-term contracts and get low salaries; PhDs who graduated in 2008 and 2010 more frequently experience risk of self-employed or non-academic researchers at all. The economic crisis fragmented the terms of contracts, in particular, increasing fixed-term contracts and unemployment and furthermore, polarizing salaries (very high salary or very low salary). Further studies are necessary to understand whether this new condition is a constraint or an opportunity for PhDs in the political and social sciences.

AB The main focus of the Italian literature on the profession of the sociologist is the transmission of sociological knowledge and the occupational outcomes of sociology graduates. In my paper, I try to examine additional aspects in depth that I believe to be crucial for the development of the profession: the absence of a sociological community of interests, the weak forms of association not supporting sociologists working in non-academic settings with regards to interprofessional conflicts and a public presence that conveys and transmits the usefulness of the profession and the discipline. Sociologists rarely use the skills acquired through formal education to strengthen their position in the labour market through collective actions. Their effort to control the market of particular services is too weak. In the paper, I argue for the need to construct a community of interest that intends to include practitioners and academic sociologists in their entirety, independently from institutional membership and to promote sufficient control on the dynamics of supply and demand of professional services.

AB Sociologists and social scientists' low professional status looms large when looking at the rapidly changing professional hierarchy based on the prominent role of technology and of scientific applications for peoples' lives. The paper seeks to unveil the inadequate professionalization of sociology in Greece and to relate this situation to the increase in the employment precariousness of sociologists over the years of the economic crisis. Moreover, the dominant economy-centric ideological/ governance model which promotes the 'utilitarianism' of the social sciences has played a significant role in sociology's residual position. The paper is structured along three axes: First of all, the low professional status of sociologists is related to the delayed academic institutionalization of sociology. Secondly, there is brief discussion of the relevant literature on graduate supply and demand in the labour market and the expansion of higher education. Thirdly, a more focused discussion is developed which portrays the opportunities and challenges faced by sociologists and other social scientists in the labour market, giving particular emphasis to the current situation in the wake of the financial crisis. Finally, it is concluded that the vicious circle of low professionalization and high precariousness facing sociologists demands institutional action aimed at reformulating the public agenda.

AB This article analyses and critically discusses the professional situation of sociologists in the system of professions. Some characteristics of the sociological profession are analysed against emerging challenges in the knowledge society. The first section portrays the current situation of sociology in real work contexts as a multisector profession in multidisciplinary settings. The second section analyses some drawbacks in the training and guidance of sociologists by providing significant examples. Spain is used as a strategic research site that exemplifies the existence of a robust academic community facing professional challenges. The third section outlines several strategies for collective action at the interface between the university and the professional domain in order to improve the participation of sociologists in the labour market.

AB Scholars have only recently started to take an interest in the return of highly qualified migrants to their country of origin, especially when it comes to Arab countries. This research, conducted between 2014 and 2016, provides evidence on the Lebanese case, a country where most social scientists have been trained abroad. This article uses a multi-level approach and compares careers paths of social scientists trained in Lebanon and abroad, working in Lebanese public and private universities. If a foreign diploma appears as a significant factor of career differentiation, the analysis undertaken in this article nuances this finding. It reveals to what extent the characteristics of the academic field in origin countries such as Lebanon shape the career paths of academics. Public and, to a lesser extent private universities have become ideological state apparels which are used by the ruling elites to ensure their reproduction, through the revaluation of social capital. However, this reproduction is not made without social actors and their involvement. Lebanese academics develop strategies to accumulate the relevant symbolic capital in order to be recruited or promoted. The activation of the relevant political and sectarian networks is, therefore, one of the key strategies which social scientists mobilise as a first or last resort to acquire university positions.

AB This paper examines determinants of identity through examining the generational status, religiosity, and school context of migrant youth in Europe. The first part of this study focuses on the presumptions of assimilation theory for identity by testing for generational differences and evidence of ethnic revival in acculturation identity. This study also explores the influence of religion- which has often been perceived as a hindrance to integration- and school context on the types of identities students express. The questions are explored using the migrant sample of the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries (CILS4EU; England, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden). Results of multilevel logistic regressions challenge previous presumptions of identity among migrant youth and find no strong evidence for either assimilation or ethnic revival among second generation students compared with their first generation peers. However, evidence of assimilation is observed among students with a foreign-born and native parent. Religious salience, perceived discrimination, and high share of migrants at the school-level are also associated with a lower likelihood of assimilated identity and higher likelihood of integrated and separated identities, suggesting the social and contextual nature of identity formation and highlighting the role of ethnic diversity in facilitating dual identities.

AB The appropriation of nature under current capitalist conditions implies the intensification of processes of exploitation of labour, dispossession of peasants' lands, indiscriminate extraction of raw materials, and racialization of all these processes. These dynamics reveal a double process: from one side we are witnessing a global racialization generated alongside socio-ecological phenomena that are changing for the worse food, energy, land, water, and raw materials regimes. From the other side we are witnessing an imperious use of racist speeches, claims, public measures and violent practices aimed to galvanized the racial and racist spirit of European and American white populations against migrants and refugees driven by the underlying forces formerly recalled. These two dynamics are strictly interlinked. For a long time, researchers dealt with local dynamics and phenomena of racism often forgetting how global, large, planetary processes of exploitation, appropriation, and dispossession sculpt these dynamics at the local level. This article aims to deal with these processes of global racialization and racism by an analysis of the process of accumulation based on 'racialized unequal exchange' fostering the idea that that unequal ecological exchange bases on historical division of people in different subordinate races in line with the global neoliberal order.

AB Comparative analysis of colonialisms is of critical importance, and hence this article proposes and instigates such systematic comparative research with respect to same-sex sexualities and gender diversity. We offer a historical sociological comparison of the Portuguese and British empires analysing relevant regulation, in relation to two African contexts: Mozambique, which decriminalised same-sex sexual acts in 2015, and Kenya, where criminalisation persists. Through a comparative methodology, we illuminate important differences in the regulation of same-sex sexualities and gender diversity, that have contemporary legacies: (a) the difference in timing of criminalisation of same-sex acts and its impacts in the emergence of homosexuality in colonial governance; (b) the differences in transboundary moral regulation, between colonial ideologies and between Protestant and Catholic mission practices; and (c) the difference in racialised perceptions of homosexuality as a mainly European desire (in Portuguese colonialism) or as sometimes seen as potentially occurring universally (in British colonialism). Identifying such differences can assist those aligned with queer politics to understand and engage coloniality in the present.

AB 'School segregation' indicates the concentration of a minority into a school that significantly exceeds the presence of the same population living in the surrounding territory. A segregated school is generally synonymous of low level of attainment and social marginalization. This phenomenon can be addressed as an urban issue or an educational problem, studied through spatial measures or qualitative interviews, interpreted as an institutional or a spatial effect. Many disciplines and approaches have in fact addressed the topic. This article, through a critical literature review, identifies the main drivers of segregation in the institutional context, the residential distribution of the population and the households' choice. Taking into account evidence from the literature, especially from Northern Europe and United States, the author then disentangles the three drivers highlighting similarities and differences that can be found in diverse cities. Segregation in schools in fact seems eligible to acquire various shapes and features especially according to urban contexts, educational system and middle classes behaviors. The article will then highlight flaws in the current literature and suggest further research lines in order to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon.

AB This themed section is aimed at presenting different contributes on climatic-environmental migration. With this paper we set out to provide an introduction of the subject: this includes a general review of relevant publications and a brief analysis of global scenarios. The second part of the paper gives a general interpretation of the issue, using a historical-social procedural method, of the global ecology of migrations. The ecological approach is based on the need to integrate the geographical and the historical aspects of the subject, and to consider both local and global dimensions. The authors examine the subject of climatic-environmental migration up to the present day, demonstrating the complex relations between environmental and geopolitical issues as determiners of migratorial phenomena. An analysis of the relations between climatic-environmental migration and urban dynamics draws the reader's attention to certain problematic areas and potential vicious circles, most notably the problem of urban gigantism, especially in river delta areas, in African and Asiatic cities. We conclude with an introduction of the five papers of the theme section. One is on the effects of environmental change on migration in the future, and possible policy responses and the other one is on environmental racism and migrations.

AB As temperatures and sea levels rise, among other issues, environmental change is becoming an increasingly important driver of both internal and external migration across the globe. The loss of livelihood that these changes engender, and will increasingly cause in the coming decades, is forcing larger and larger numbers of individuals and groups to seek opportunities in other areas. As this phenomenon becomes more prevalent, it is imperative that communities, governments, NGOs, and other interested parties put in place policies to mitigate and adapt. This paper looks at the intersection of environmental change and migration. More specifically, it discusses the changing climate and environment and then looks at how this will, and already is, affecting migration patterns around the world. It then will provide a number of guiding principles for policymakers, academics, and others to think about when dealing with this issue.

DT Article
DE Migration; climate change; farming; yields; Mexico
ID FOOD SECURITY; INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT; DROUGHT; VULNERABILITY; RAINFALL;
   REFUGEES; IMPACTS; RISK
AB In this paper I argue that the cultural meaning of subsistence farming is at least equally important as its function as a livelihood strategy in rural Mexico for at least two reasons. First, subsistence farming is more or less important during different stages of people's lives. Many young people, particularly men, intend to migrate to the USA for work and have little interest in farming, while older people keep up the tradition of farming the land they inherited from their ancestors. Second, in most cases only households who rely on external sources of income for their basic needs - including remittances - can afford keeping the tradition of subsistence farming and take the risk of crop failures. Poorer households, in contrast, tend to stop farming when revenues cannot be guaranteed, and they might also be unable to afford international migration. Drawing on qualitative empirical data collected in two rural communities in the Mexican state Zacatecas in 2008 and in 2018 these findings contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between more frequent and more severe droughts, related changes to the yield output of subsistence farming for rural dwellers, and outmigration to the USA in times of climate change.

DE Relational good; rational choice; relational sociology; social theory;
   common good
ID PARTICIPATION; GUANXI
AB Two sociological mainstreams, one based on rational choice theory and one on relational sociology, converge in affirming that relational goods are those that can be enjoyed only if shared with some others. Both agree that it is a kind of goods different from strictly private goods, which are enjoyed alone, and from standard public goods, which are enjoyed impersonally by any number. However, they differ in the way they understand the nature of these goods, how they are generated and what are their social consequences. For the theory of rational choice, they derive from the fact that individuals find gratification in sharing a certain relationship with other people, so that the aggregation of these propensities generates a local public good. According to relational sociology, instead, these goods are emergent sui generis relationships that are sought for their intrinsic value, as bearers of good life for those who share them. The author compares these different approaches, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. He concludes by claiming that relational goods have their own ontological status. They are produced by subjects who reflexively orient one towards the other to generate a relationship from which benefits derive for all those who participate in it.

AB As modernization has become globally valued, the topic of gender equality as a human right has been taken up across the world. In a simultaneously individual and national-level analysis, we sought links between citizens' views on gender equality and their social and economic conditions, as well as relationships with factors concerning religion. With data generated from the World Values Survey-Wave 6, and from the UIS database maintained by the UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, we analyzed a sample of 68,633 respondents from 53 countries. Results supported our hypothesis that positive views of gender equality are associated with modernized, non-Islamic civilizations whose upper social classes endorse gender equality, and which feature strong income, higher levels of employment, and less religiosity at the individual level. Our study also showed moderating roles being played by modernization and Islamic civilization in the relationship between religiosity and gender-equality attitudes. Our results call into question modernization theory's claim for a linear path between modernization and widespread gender equality over time. The results further indicate a need to analyze how nonuniformly modernized countries, divergent with regard to their citizens' religiosity, might achieve gender equality.

ID REFUGEES; DRIVERS; HEALTH; STATES
AB Climate change is a key issue in twenty-first century international politics, as is evidenced by the twenty-four world conferences devoted to the subject that have been called by the United Nations. The effect that climate change exerts on human migration is a matter that has recently started to acquire considerable importance, not only as an element of public opinion, but also as a subject of academic publications. While available data on the matter is still far from precise and there are no definite figures on the climate change refugees numbers, published research shows that a colossal wave of migration could come about, caused by climate environmental conditions. In the view of the ever-growing importance of the connection between migration, climate and environmental change, the international scientific community has experienced a rapid growth of interest in these matters over the last ten years. The present contribution sets out to present, by means of a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications, a critical 'snapshot' of the development of the research that has been undertaken, paying particular attention to the integration of semantic elements that climatic and environmental change have in common with the issue of migration.

The research activity envisaged by the project was focused, first of all, on the knowledge level of the risks associated with migration among the rural population of the region, but many of the hypotheses concerned the relations that had never been sufficiently thematized between migratory waves and climate changes that have affected the area in the last 50 years.

AB This paper explores the role of social capital in creating social innovation ecosystems and fostering social impact. We examine two cases, chosen for their pioneering experiences in the field of tackling poverty in Latin America: Socialab and Compartamos con Colombia. Focusing on their structure of interactions (through network-level and node-level indicators), we examine the structural characteristics of the two ecosystems studied. We then correlate relational data to study the association between perceived social impact and the structural aspects. Results confirm heterophilic ecosystems and high levels of perceived impact as good drivers for strengthening future collaborations.

AB Despite the structural characteristics of international migration in most European countries, the persistence of prejudice and negative attitudes towards immigrants represents an unsolved problem that erodes social cohesion. European institutions continue to be concerned about the spread of xenophobia, especially among young generations. This article aims to shed light on the crucial role of intergroup friendships, considered a key factor in reducing the hostility toward immigrant groups. In particular, the aim is to verify the effects of intergroup friendships on prejudice, using data derived from an international survey carried out in France and Italy, two emblematic European countries as regarding the experience of international migration. 1,642 French and Italian adolescents, selected by a rationale choice sample, were involved: multivariate analysis confirmed the hypothesis that adolescents who hold intergroup friendships show lower levels of prejudice. The influence of the intergroup friendships on the decrease of intolerance is evident especially on socioeconomic and security issues while for the identity matters its effects are moderated by the country of residence of the participants. Considering these results, positive contacts among local and immigrant populations are recommended in order to reduce social fragmentation and foster social cohesion.

AB This paper analyzes elite tax compliance from a sociological perspective in order to examine how different tax behaviors are justified or how they embody different taxpayers' subjectivities. Drawing from the case of Chile and using a qualitative approach based on 32 interviews conducted with members of the economic elite, it is argued that forms of non-compliance -such as evasion and avoidance- are grounded in different repertoires of evaluation' while denoting a plurality of distinctions and criteria of evaluation which relate to the legal culture in which the tax system operates. Findings show that legalism -a literal conception of the rules- does not always favor tax compliance and that it may even go against the purpose of tax collection when a creative use of the law prevails. Furthermore, legalism and creativity allow for the main justifications for challenging tax payment as well as the perceptions and beliefs that underlie the everyday relationship between taxpayers and the state to be understood.

AB In the contemporary multicentric world, sovereign states have to manage carefully the construction of their image, defining their role and aspirations. With the re-definition of the state centric politics, stories become relevant: communication is a form of power, and networked forms of communication are becoming progressively a way to conquer the transnational public spheres. Through strategic narratives of foreign politics, states try to set up the tales' of international affairs and foreign strategies, to suggest a world vision, a causal interpretation, determining frames that affect transnational actors' position in the international environment. Sovereign states develop these kind of frame using tools and theories referred to the commercial branding tradition to promote and support their own policies and identity. We decided to investigate how that process is made through information diffusion on digital platforms.In this work, it has been analyzed the content presented through Twitter posts by the Foreign Ministries accounts of four different States dissimilar for geopolitical positioning and security concerns (USA; Israel; France; Sweden), for a period of three months (9/1/2015-11/30/2015); leading to the identification of different models and characteristic patterns of self-representation.The thematic content analysis, based on the identification of macrocategories and micro-issues, has led to the identification of different models and characteristic patterns of self-representation, determined by domestic vicissitudes, and has shown some regularities, caused by the branding vocation of autobiographical online contents.

AB This paper introduces a political opportunity approach to conceptualizing the political recognition of states in the international system. The usefulness of the approach is demonstrated through a comparative analysis of the historical trajectories of Tibet, Taiwan, and Palestine in their attempts to become recognized as nation-states. I argue that political opportunities, alignment of interests, timing, and external patronage created political recognition outcomes observed for entities like Tibet, Taiwan, and Palestine. Recognition outcomes took multiple forms and included opportunities for recognition as well as whether or not a state government recognized these entities as independent states. More broadly, I argue that recognition outcomes for the cases in question are shaped by a larger political structure that I describe as the opportunity structure for recognition.'

AB As part of the international trend towards personalisation, in 2013 Australia launched a major disability scheme aiming to give participants greater choice and control over services. The scheme aims to cover a wide diversity of disabilities, services and significant geographical area - resulting in a highly complex system of local overlapping markets. At four years into implementation a range of challenges have emerged. In this paper we firstly describe the Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme, then explore a range of implementation challenges it currently faces as a large-scale personalisation scheme. Based on these experiences we pose a range of questions for similar schemes internationally.

AB This essay discusses the acceleration and integration of everything (AIE), i.e. of all forms of electronic devices into a distributed communications grid that will, inexorably, ubiquitously change the way we exist towards a convergent singularity of robotics, informatics, genetics and nanotechnology. The changes may be more than the collective or individual human psyche is prepared to engage, and will require that societies get used to these changes and incorporate them. The use of communication and information technology is also as important for sociology as it is for any other subject as it influences and is influenced by different kinds of policy, about citizenship. The trajectory lines of communication engineering reveal some thought-provoking questions. The article will progress correspondingly: (I) we will first consider the Internet as the most important facilitation of directional change and lifestyle impact; (II) we will detail a nascent area of electronics emerging from nanotechnology research and development called 'spintronics'; (III) we will next reflect upon the powerful varying peripheral devices that continue to shrink in size and become more useful; and finally, (IV) we will discuss the increase in communication activity and usages.

Namely, the work will highlight the complex and multidisciplinary aspects of each innovation process: as a matter of fact, when innovation takes place, it involves diverse category of actors: scientists, engineers, political authorities, entrepreneurs, and public opinion. Second, the work will focus on the uncertainty that each innovation process entails, especially in terms of intersection between technological and cognitive dimensions. The conclusions will assess that systemics are the best epistemic approach for dealing with those issues.

AB Innovation comprises an area of human activity that bridges disciplinary boundaries in epistemological domains as well as action frameworks in ontological domains. It involves a complex system composed of people, organizations, role structures, skills, and knowledge bases, in addition to the hardware produced in workshops and factories. This paper argues that Systemic Innovation, as an emerging field of praxis in its own right, provides an integral and actionable framework for the curation of human initiatives that span human, technological, environmental, and generational concerns with lifelong learning and creative design initiatives. To do this, the field draws on socio-technical systems theory (STS), the study of living systems and ecological system dynamics (including such areas of embodied action as permaculture), and evolutionary systems design (itself comprised of general evolution theory (GST), social systems design methodology (SSM), and lifelong and transformative learning praxes). How these frameworks are used to guide systemic innovation in service of life, increasingly robust and supportive living environments, and future-creating scenarios of systemic viability and thrivability is at the heart of the field of Systemic Innovation.

DE Citizenship; global law; innovation; policy modelling; hypercitizenship
AB The main reference for twentieth century politics is the Nation-state, whose territory-citizens were the unique and only target of norm production. Furthermore, the function of norm production was commitment of public bodies, whose legitimacy - at least in democratic countries - depends on the 'people'. i.e. the citizens that were the target of the law production itself. An important fact, is that national production of norms slowly shifted from the legislative to the executive power. Too many were the decisions to be made in a brief term, and too fast were people's emotional reactions, to let this commitment to an impersonal and procedural institution like the legislative power. In a globalized world, things have changed under many aspects. The multiplicity of decisional levels, e.g.: on one side, supranational bodies and entity are more and more frequently assuming this function; furthermore, more and more frequently, national commitments have shifted towards more restricted levels, such as regions or cities. Even the target has turned much more complex: due to more and more massive migration phenomena, all national law makings are nowadays affecting large groups of people, who are not citizens, while citizens are often subjected to other countries' legislation. Among the main consequences, is that decision-making process have untied from contingent popular reactions and it is possible now to base upon legislative processes, a long-term perspective and a global scale. This paper aims at showing this scenario consequences for innovation processes. Namely, it is possible now to set an environment for innovation by enhancing exchanges of ideas, competences and information is the result of innovation processes, no matter if social or technological. In other words, their work will aim not only at comprehending the process of law-making in the global era, but also proposing models for law-making activities that grant the best environment possible for innovation processes, i.e. free circulation of ideas, science and people.

AB Since, Vilfredo Pareto formulated what later became Pareto's principle (also referred to as the 80/20 or 90/10 principle, see Koch [2008. The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Achieving More with Less. New York: Doubleday) and Kiyosaki [2011. Rich Dad's Guide to Investing: What the Rich Invest In, That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!. Jackson: Perseus Distribution] for example), which emphasizes the importance of empowering innovation not by improving the new just for the new's sake but by reducing obsolescence. For example, some studies (Pitasi, A., & Ferone, E. (2008). II tempo zero del desiderio. Milano: McGraw-Hill) have shown that a Roger's innovation cycle (R) can improve its speed (S) by cutting Williamson's transactional costs (W) as much as possible, i.e. S=R/W. This paper focuses on a three-level analysis of the evolution of Pareto's principle up to its 'less is more' version. Micro-level: It consists of dyads and/or small groups and requires a psycho-social approach, which is more micro than micro. Meso-level: R relies on middle-range studies and encompasses mainly single, specific organizations; it requires theoretical tools such as R. Macro-level: The objects in this level are national/supranational political and economic organizational notions such as Kuznets' ccle or Schumpeter's cycle. The sections of this paper are structured top-down, from macro to psychosocial, according to Elias' (2010. The Civilizing Process: Sociogenetic and Psychogenetic Investigations. Hoboken: Blackwell Publisher) concept of process. The paper is based upon the assumption that openness to change is different at each level. The aim is twofold; on one hand, the goal is to provide a better comprehension of organizational change phenomena and on the other, we aimed to develop a social practical capability to overcome the hurdles that can stop or slow down innovation processes.

DE Digitalization; intellectual property rights; taxation; patent boxes
AB The emerging globalization policies are underlining the key importance of international and supranational regulations and standards. Digitalization has reframed the free circulation of intangible assets such as intellectual property rights (IPRs) on a global scale, technologically speeding up what the legal norms sometimes had not considered yet. Digitalization has dramatically helped to improve the linkage between production, distribution and their location, as virtual venues have also become virtual markets. Innovative digitalization and innovation and taxation policies are strongly interconnected. In this scenario, the emerging role of the EU as a connector not only among itself, but also with Canada, Japan and eventually Mercosur is a key piece of evidence that borders become weaker as long as digitalization evolves. It is dear that digitalization leads to a paradox for tax, business and wealth evolution system: the more digitalization, the more horizontalization of tax law and a speed up in verticalization from international to supranational can be seen. And this is the next turbulent challenge before us.

AB This paper introduces a suite of technical tools developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) which aim to monitor the prevalence and impact of a new invasive insect pest in Africa - Fall Armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda). The roll-out of the tools is still at an early phase, and further studies will be necessary to evaluate the outcomes. The specific content of this paper will be the description of the four tools - which together make up a monitoring framework - followed by an analysis of the factors determining the likely future effectiveness of the tools and the framework according to innovation theory. More specifically, the Triple Helix Model of innovation will be evaluated and used to develop specific research questions, the answers to which will likely determine the future effectiveness of the FAW monitoring framework and its tools. It will emerge that a combination of institutional, technological and social factors will condition the effectiveness and sustainability of the suite of innovative monitoring tools developed. Furthermore, the Triple Helix model itself is shown to have a crucial limitation in this case due to the fact that it does not explicitly consider the role of civil society in the effective innovation process.

DE Citizenship; globalization; cosmopolitanism; innovation; policy making
AB A viable citizenship program is pivotal for state development, and to let official policy determine politics as taught by T. J. Lowi. National states based on national-state citizenship are weaker and weaker before the key challenges of our times. That is why citizenship programs are more and more focused on innovation policies to integrate ius sanguinis, ius soli, citizenship on investment and citizenship on performance. This paper provides a strategic innovation policy by linking development and global citizenship. Innovative law-making, citizenship policy innovation, and development are dramatically interconnected to evolve a scenario in which citizenship represents a key intangible asset to generate tangible wealth in open horizons where free circulation of tangibles or intangibles is strategic and linked to downsizing the bureaucratic burdens, the local power centers by evolving a much leaner and higher organizational standard of citizenship: legally, isotropically, and socially. This results in a new theory of social systems as a useful tool for the management of the complexity of social relations, breaking territorial boundaries, and making them cosmopolitan (Beck, 2006. The cosmopolitan vision. Cambridge: Polity Press). In order to achieve this, the present study will be approached and related with cosmopolitism and development, aiming to bring new contours of study to this subject.

AB This short note provides a few conclusive considerations on theoretical approaches to innovation studies, from the scope of the works that appeared in the monographic issue of International Review of Sociology: 'Innovation and Sociological Theory'. Namely, the focus is on the relationship between the actors in charge of implementing an innovation process and the social/cultural structure of the target population. Within this framework, the theoretical approach that best fits to the complexity and the uncertainty related to this field of study, is Systemic Sociology.

AB In global value research, Muslim-majority countries emerge not only as consistently more patriarchal but also as a rather homogeneous cultural cluster to that effect. We, however, know little about the variation within Muslim-majority countries in these values through comparative analysis of subnational units. This limits the possibility of identifying 'localized pockets of transformation' in support for gender equality in what the global research depicts as a relatively stagnate region. This manuscript is a first attempt at explaining the subnational variation in gender egalitarian values across Muslim-majority countries and its effect on key individual-level variables like gender. We mod& province and individual-level variance across 64 provinces in Egypt, Iran and Turkey with multilevel analysis (Hierarchical Linear Modeling HLM 7.0). Results show that whether provinces are more urban positively influences gender egalitarian values. At the individual level, we find that whether provinces are more urban has the most powerful impact on unmarried women in increasing support for gender equality. Based on the results, we conclude that research must pay greater attention to the local contexts in which Muslim women are embedded, like their provinces, in terms of the opportunities they create outside of the 'marriage market' and the implications for their support of gender equality.

ID FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY
AB The dominant thought in the Western Culture, put the soul first and despised the body, generating distinctions and hierarchies in which the spiritual or immaterial was considered superior to the corporeal or material. But the bodies have not allowed themselves to be reduced to these dichotomous patterns. The queer discovered the body, worked with it, but returned to the field of immateriality in which the identity is lodged. The crip has completed the gesture of the queer entering fully into the field of the body, denaturalizing categories (deficiency and disability) and interpreting it as radically interdependent. However, in the absence of tradition in dealing with the body, both in reflection and politics, we are inspired by other cultures that always put corporeality in the foreground. The Native American Indians are explicit in terms of contrast between humans and non-humans, because for them there is a unique culture with multiple natures, as opposed to Western, because we believe in plurality of cultures and in a uniform nature. In order to coexist with this diversity, the West has invented 'cultural relativism' and 'multiculturalism', while the Native American Indians have developed a 'multinaturalism' with their 'perspectivism'. We propose to denominate perspectivism a modality of science and politics that could manifest the radical influence of bodies.

DT Article
DE Bourdieu; social topology; geometry; groups; flows
ID FIELDS; CRITIQUE; NETWORKS; FORMS
AB This article focuses on Bourdieu's topological conception of social space to expand on it and develop an alternative model. Bourdieu describes social space as topological because it consists of a set of relative positions. Individuals in similar positions can come together to form social groups, so that differences between groups reveal or at least reflect the different positions in space. For this reason, it is convenient to think of social space as Bourdieu understands it as a space of groups. Yet there are other kinds of geometry beside topology. The article examines the difference between topology and Euclidean geometry to determine how we can modify Bourdieu's model to uncover other potential features of social space. Rather than conceptualizing social space as a space of groups, we can envision a flow that is created as individuals relay one another so that the flow can go on even though the same individuals never stay put. Flows can arise by finding support on other flows. Thus arise structures in space that cannot be 'mapped onto' social actors occupying different positions because actors only sustain the flows through their perpetual turnover.

ID SOCIOLOGY
AB This paper examines how suicide bombers are framed in terrorist communication, focusing on the empirical case of al-Qaeda's suicide campaigns. Relying on the concept of media of communication in social systems theory, three main communicative levels of terrorist propaganda underlying the representation of suicide bombers are identified. First, on the level of power, armed organizations aim to coerce and deter their enemy by staging a complex set of communicative forms that signal their militants' determination and resolve. Second, on the level of influence, armed groups exploit the symbolic qualities of suicide missions to gain support from a presumed constituency by referring to suicide attackers' reputation and their ultimate sacrifice. Finally, by combining references to values and influence, bombers' behavior and last wills are used as recruitment tools to attract new fighters by appealing to principles rooted in the prestige of martyrs. All of these communicative forms support the hypothesis that the representation of heroism and martyrdom is a crucial component of suicide terrorism. The synergy between the psychological impact of costly actions like suicide missions and framing processes exalting the military, moral and religious qualities of attackers constitutes a sophisticated weapon of a more recent asymmetric warfare involving radical Islamist organizations.

AB This paper analyses the effects of HIV-related stigma on children made orphans by AIDS and other children made vulnerable by HIV. HIV-related stigma is usually identified as the process of devaluation of people living with, affected by, or associated with HIV. The vast majority of children orphaned by AIDS or made vulnerable by HIV are ostracized, discriminated against, and isolated due to the shame associated with this disease. The authors emphasize how stigmatization makes it much more difficult to protect the basic rights of these children and add that many of them are at higher risk of being exploited by criminal gangs or becoming victims of abuse, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Consequently, the authors suggest to promote a strategy that draws orphans and other children made vulnerable by HIV and AIDS into social protection schemes and programmes.

DE Capability approach; positional objectivity; conversion; markets;
   deliberative democracy
ID SOCIETY; MARKET; AGENCY; SEN
AB Drawing on Amartya Sen's writings, this article presents the capability approach to democracy and shows its relevance for the sociological reflection and research on democratic processes conceived as ways to convert individual preferences into collective norms or decisions. Two moments are key in this respect: the formation of individual preferences and their translation into collective norms in the course of public debates. The initial sections present Sen's conception of democracy, particularly emphasizing its articulation with the notions of 'positional objectivity' and 'conversion'. Then, this conception is compared with two other mechanisms that may be used to coordinate individual decisions or preferences, namely the market and idealistic views on deliberative democracy. The article emphasizes how the capability approach departs from these two conceptions with regard to the two key concepts of capacity to aspire and capability for voice. The final section shows how Sen's notion of democracy may open up a new field for research, namely the sociological investigation of the informational (or knowledge) basis of democracy.

DE Popular participation; smart cities; democracy; good governance
AB According to the United Nations data more than half of humanity lives today in the cities, but it is expected that in 2050 it could be almost 80% of the global population. That means a transformative role of cities at all levels in the coming decades. Participation and democracy in the twenty-first century must be promoted and practiced from the cities. A popular participation based on the observation, and also in an active participation within the management of the government can promote good governance where citizens can be empowered to achieve a higher level of democracy in our cities but also in our society. Currently theres an international standard on quality management in local government; ISO 18091:2014, it contains 39 indicators on public policies that local governments cannot stop attending. I would like to present in this article the success case of the Integral Citizen Observatory of Los Cabos (OCI Los Cabos) based on this international standard, as a model of smart citizens aware and competent. It has been such a good job that the incoming Mayor has included it in the actual Municipal Development Plan for Los Cabos 2015-2018, the diagnostic report data and the proposals of the Integral Citizen Observatory.

AB From the early Frankfurt School through to the work of Manuel Castells, there has been a rich body of work on the cleavage between technological and social developments of the twentieth century in respect of the consequences for the constitution of subjectivity. However, little attention is paid to the role of children during their childhoods in attempts to bridge this gap beyond discussions about the democratic actors children will become when they are adults. This paper argues that only the full integration of children, during their childhoods, into democratic development of societies will prevent the deepening of the rift between technological and social progress. The paper traces the correspondence between the new childhood studies and those concepts of politics and politicisation which can support social progress towards an emancipatory social perspective undergirded by particular and democratisation of all areas of everyday life. Drawing on Bourdieu and ideas of participation as action, the paper critically examines the various mechanisms by which children are conventionally excluded from democratic participation and then explores how a deeper consideration of agency in childhood and social actorship opens up alternative mechanisms of inclusion and the concomitant expansion of the concept of democracy.

SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
DE Sociological theory; creativity; modern civilization; crisis
AB From the contributions of H.Joas and A.Reckwitz, this article tries to outline a sociogenesis of the concept of creativity, associating it more to the general social and cultural context -the process of modern civilization- in which it springs up than to creative action. In particular, it is a question of describing and analyzing the contributions of Sociology to creativity in relation to the process of modern civilization and the ambivalences inherent in it. Particularly, those that contrast the individual with the collective, space with time and order with the crisis.
   In this respect, the article reaches two final conclusions: first, that creativity is shown as ambiguous and contradictory, that is, it has inherited the ambivalences of Modernity; and, secondly, that creativity undergoes the turbulences and indeterminations proper to the stage of transition and crisis in which we live. Creativity, then, is one more exponent of the contradictions of the modern society in which it is developed, functioning fundamentally as a social and cultural construction. That is, it is collaborating more in building what we are and less than we would like to be.

ID CONTEXTS
AB This article aims to extend the discussions that confront the intersectionality of Black American feminists to the 'consubstantiality of social relations' espoused by French materialist feminists. It proposes to do so by moving away from this 'geo-cultural' territory in order to better anchor the reflection in an epistemological and methodological ground. In order to do this, the article begins with some contributions and controversies of the intersectional approach to the renewal of feminist theories, and then addresses the issues that this renewal raises to the approach of consubstantiality. It then situates the approaches of intersectionality and of consubstantiality on the same epistemological continuum to discuss the middle way unlocked by the intersectionality of Black feminists. Finally, the effects of knowledge of this third way are examined.

The literary features of these novels, set in the Italy of the Red Brigades and the Peru of Shining Path and Tupac Amaru, foster a political perspective that is a de facto endorsement of the status quo in each society. They hinder a comprehensive understanding of the underpinnings of terrorism that is essential to the formation of counterterrorism strategies.

The research is based on semi-structured interviews and ethnographic observations. This text aims at exploring a hidden feature of the hegemonic heteronormative masculinity: its vulnerability. When the dominant, virile and heterosexually active masculinity that these young men try to present is questioned by their interlocutors (other men and women, the peers or the sexual partners of the interviewees), different defensive strategies are adopted. The analysis of these strategies will lead us to explore the experiences of these young men, between their migrant trajectories in Europe and their relationships to the home country.

ID SOCIAL CARE; DESISTANCE; REFORM
AB Various approaches to personalisation are well-established in the UK social care sector and are now starting to 'travel' to other sectors. In this paper we report findings from an evaluation of a pilot to test elements of personalisation in the management of offenders in probation services within the English criminal justice system. Following a review of evidence from social care, three different approaches to personalised-practice were developed and tested on a small-scale in three separate sites. The evaluation finds that all three approaches were implemented reasonably successfully, but challenges were identified including that personalised approaches are more time-consuming, that staff need support to exercise professional discretion and that balancing greater choice with managing criminogenic risk requires new ways of conceptualising the relationship between case manager and service user. Overall, 'deeper' approaches to personalisation, such as co-production, will take time to emerge. This paper makes two important contributions to the debate on personalisation in public services. First, it addresses the question of how transferable the concept of personalisation is from the social care sector to other sectors in the UK, in this case the criminal justice system. Secondly, it outlines a methodology for developing and evaluating personalisation pilots, prior to a wider roll-out.

DE Personalisation; social care policies; personal budgets; disability
AB With the objective to eradicate disability related discrimination and promote choice, control, independence and inclusion for all individuals, the personalisation agenda paved the way for a transformation of social care and disability services in the UK. This paper explores personalisation both as a vision of care and support services and as a toolkit promoted by government policies in order to allow for such vision to translate into practice - the use of direct payments and personal budgets being an example. A qualitative case study analysis has been conducted in the context of care services for disabled young people and by means of in-depth interviews with professionals, parents and the young people themselves. Such analysis reconstructs the implementation of personalisation showing how the toolkit offered by government policies has been used and interpreted differently by the different actors in the field and how this has brought to a wide range of opportunities but also risks. What seems to emerge from the study is that the vision of personalisation risks being hampered by its toolkit and that alternatives might be needed in order to safeguard the potential of personalisation as a vision.

Personalization became a relevant part of the so called 'welfare innovation narrative', which concerns - to name but a few English personalization agenda, Scottish self-directed support, Finnish education system, Norwegian cash-for-care policies. Even the European Commission is addressing new social services, reshaped through users' capabilities. The aim of this paper is to critically explain, through a case study focused on the Sardinian disability policy, how social policy's morphogenetic cycles influence the governance of personalized disability plans and, consequently, the possibility of their implementation.

DT Article
DE Professions; architecture; social change; professional discourse;
   Israeli society
ID SOCIOLOGY; GOVERNMENTALITY; MEDICINE; TIMES
AB This article examines how professions behave in periods of social change. The article considers whether professions take positions vis-a-vis broader social discourse, and explores the relationship between the professions' positions and those of the government. The article examines these questions through the case of the Israeli architectural profession's behavior after the 1967 war in both the newly occupied territories, over which Israeli control is under dispute among Israeli Jews, as well as the pre-1967 areas, in which Israeli sovereignty enjoys a consensus among Israeli Jews. The article traces both design and construction activities, as well as the discourse that followed in their wake. The article's conclusion is that changes in professional discourse are a way to understand the profession's position regarding a given set of social changes. We argue that the transition from an inward-facing professional discourse to an outward-facing professional discourse that addresses the larger society is both an indication of that profession's condition as well as the condition of the social group to which it belongs.

AB This paper revisits the development of Basil Bernstein's theoretical armories and reinvigorates its relevance to social class analysis in education, while identifying some of the challenges and promises in doing so. The main arguments are grounded in an empirical analysis of the recent Liberal Studies reform in Hong Kong's senior secondary education. An extended discussion of using a Bernsteinian approach to pedagogy-specific class explanations is developed: (a) transition of code modalities between stages of education; (b) differentiated pedagogic identities in the middle class; (c) pedagogic grammars of specialized habituses; and (d) possibilities for an interruption in the process of social reproduction. It is concluded that continuing to build on Bernstein's legacy will allow us to achieve a more nuanced understanding of the ways that class works through different pedagogic contexts in order for the conception of an interruption of class reproduction to be useful in guiding transformative practices in it.

AB The social processes underlying the production of scientific knowledge make it an inherently social endeavor. The interaction between systems of thought and affiliation has been subject of the sociology of science, with remarkable developments in studies on the structure of scientific fields based on social networks analysis. Although psychology is one of the pioneer fields investigated in this literature, there is scarcity of research on psychology. The objective of this paper is to describe the social networks' dynamics of knowledge production in psychology in Brazil, comparing association patterns among its sub-areas. For this purpose, 395 researchers responded an electronic questionnaire about their relationships. Networks of nine psychology sub-areas were analyzed for structural properties (i.e. density, centrality) and relational exchanges (the connecting roles of boundary spanners and central connectors). Findings showed different structures and connectivity patterns between networks, but most of these areas configure as small worlds. Discussion explores implications of these findings for the production of knowledge within areas, and for the national production of psychological knowledge as a whole, with effects on the international projection of knowledge produced in Brazil.

AB This study examines and compares, for the first time, the MOW (Meaning of Work) among Jews and Arabs (Muslims and Christians) in Israel and attempts to explain the similarities and the differences in work ethics among these ethno-religious groups. The MOW questionnaire was conducted on 898 Jewish, 215 Muslim and 103 Christian respondents who were currently working. The MOW dimensions were: economic orientation, entitlement norms, obligation norms, interpersonal relations orientation, intrinsic orientation and work centrality. The findings reveal significant differences in most of the MOW dimensions between the three religious groups. Overall, demographic factors partially explain the MOW differences. The MOW differences among the three groups can be explained mainly by cultural differences. Since there is mass Arab (Muslims and Christians) immigration from the Middle East to Europe this study provides a better understanding of their perceptions about work and their work values and ethics. The applications of the findings for organizations are discussed.

AB Bitcoin and its peculiar, decentralized transaction system, have already ignited interest by professional and retail traders in search for profits and by economists and legal experts, looking for possible regulation to contain illegal uses. We instead examine the unexpected and ongoing success of Bitcoin from a sociological perspective, first questioning its unusual legitimation system, backed by the so called 'blockchain technology', instead of by governmental authorities. Then we collect data and elements to reconstruct Bitcoin's history as a cryptocurrency, starting from the mysterious story surrounding its birth. We then follow its spread and development through social networks and words of mouth, together with its sudden booms and bursts, finally to suggest that both users and institutional regulators should be aware of the risks of Bitcoin and of its alleged power to challenge our very notion of money.

AB This themed section is aimed at evaluating different personalised policies and at drawing a clear map of opportunities and challenges for future implementations. All the essays are based on evaluative researches and on original case studies. They concern different policies: the Australian National Disability Scheme (NDIS) a first serious venture into personalised funding; personalisation in the management of offenders in probation services within the English criminal justice system; social care services for young disabled people attempting to personalise their transition from childhood into adulthood (in Redbridge, UK); health personal plans for disabled people (in Sardinia, Italy). These case studies address the question of how transferable the concept of personalisation is from the social care sector to other and outline different methodologies for developing and evaluating person-centred policies. Last but not least they reflect on a bundle of issues which seem to emerge autonomously from such different case studies. We can sum up their results affirming that personalisation is not an individual consumer-client technology, simply confronted with a single market context and new professionals. It has to be steered within an appropriate context, including new type of professionals, users' led associations and a new governance's architecture. If the public role has to shape freedom and control, helping people to exercise choice in a collectively responsible way and, consequently, to participate in creating public goods, then the person-centred turn will have to confront, at least, some emergent issues, which in turn need specific forms of governance.

AB This study examines the creation and use of meaningful public spaces in community gardens through activities focusing on 'placemaking', a multifaceted approach to the design of urban spaces. As a process of adding value and meaning to the public sphere through community based revitalization projects, placemaking aims at creating an innovative vision around the spaces that people consider as important to their daily life and experience. The need for 'making better places for people' calls for a strong involvement of local communities and implies the rethinking of disciplinary paradigms, a critical reflection on the role of urban planning and the experimentation of innovative place-based approaches. The results from an investigation of two community gardens in Berlin outline how they help build cohesion and vitality in a community, contributing to the generation of bonding, bridging social capital. Community gardens and the involved placemaking processes, as the research in Berlin confirms, seem to have a potential for social urban development in practice and the creation of urban place quality.

AB The wider context of the trade-off between work and family is not just a matter of changing preferences. The focus of the literature in this area has been strongly concerned with the identification of factors promoting high levels of female employment than with the location of policy determinants of cross-national fertility variation. Work-family reconciliation is considered as a political action that gives quite limited and unstable support to encourage women's labour market participation, this results in the poor development of external services and in fewer benefits for women, who have to undertake multiple roles inside and outside the family. The Southern European countries (SEC) model take a specific family-oriented approach to work-family reconciliation. They are family-oriented in that they entrust the family with more responsibilities that in other countries and take a conservative/corporatist-family-oriented approach to work-family reconciliation. The key role and the interconnection between fertility and employment among women, as well as the influence of the gender system and, on the whole, of the welfare system depend on the specific culture of different countries. Based on these theoretical premises, this paper reviews the academic discussion of the meaning of work-family balance concept in the cultural context of SEC from a comparative perspective, taking in account the gender equality debate.

AB To understand the relationships between changes to the family and changes to the sphere of work and employment, and how they have developed over time, requires considering a third factor, i.e. public policies, and in particular family policies. In this article, we attempt to clarify theoretically these interactions by taking into account the changes that have taken place in France since World War II. To appraise the French configuration in a special issue on Southern Europe, we begin by explaining why we consider France is following a 'Southern path'. In a second section, we argue that family transformations are mainly the result of changes that affect work and employment. A similar process combining individualisation, flexibility and precariousness is affecting both spheres of existence. In a last section, we prose a matrix of ideas, ideologies and outcomes to understand the main family policy reforms since World War II.

AB Flexibility of working time is currently coming to the fore, with varying degrees of intensity, in European countries. After a brief analysis of flexibility (origin, characteristics, spread) in Europe, this paper will focus in particular on the Italian case by presenting a phenomenon attracting growing attention: 'Smart Working.' This is an innovative approach to work organisation that integrates and exceeds concepts such as teleworking and mobile working, thus questioning traditional constraints (such as physical space or work times and tools) and seeking new balances based on greater freedom for workers, as well as their empowerment. By taking advantage of two recent empirical investigations carried out in Italy (2011-2012) we could illustrates the relevance of S.W. in terms of both aspiration and practice, and its high incidence on core issues such as care, fertility rate, and the daily challenge of balancing family and work. In light of this, we tried to discover whether and under what conditions the introduction of different S.W. forms could be a win-win solution for companies and employees alike.

AB This paper examines the evolution of attitudes and behaviors of Spanish women regarding maternal employment and childcare. We used data from the ISSP Module 'Family and Changing Gender Roles' (International Social Survey Programme [ISSP]: Family and Changing Gender Roles Module [1994, 2002 and 2012]). First, we studied the determinants of choosing to work or not when one becomes a mother: the most important factors are education, attitudes towards maternal employment and having had a working mother when the respondent was a child. Second, we compared the changes in attitudes and employment trajectories. In more than half of the mothers, we found a discrepancy between their ideal and actual employment trajectories. This discrepancy has been increasing over the past 20 years in the case of mothers with children younger than school age and has been decreasing slightly in the case of women whose children have started school. Nevertheless, there are significant variations: more highly educated women have greater opportunities to minimize inconsistencies between their orientations and their behaviors.

AB Using historical narratives and a qualitative research approach, this paper analyses the social, cultural and cognitive causes of differentiation and stratification among Chinese migrants in the Republic of Ireland. It discusses individuals' diversified capabilities, attitudes and actual levels of integration, as well as their disparate patterns of self-identification. In the research area of Chinese migrants in Ireland, in-group diversity and its implications is still a novel research topic. With this introductory work, the authors seek to draw more attention to this particular group, especially to the need for studies of encounters between subgroups and longitudinal investigations. The paper points out that subgroups of Chinese migrants in Ireland are divided according to social classification and self-categorisation, which have distinct significances for subgroup members' integration and identity.

AB A regime change not only rests on new rules and political opportunities, but also it may bring alternatives in the distribution of power and representation of groups. The installation of a new regime, in particular, a regime change from autocracy to democracy, could also be beneficial for the representation of women in parliament. Including women in the country's positions of power could be a sign of openness in the political arena, could provide legitimacy to the new regime and might stand for a new set of values. In this paper we measure the degree to which women's representation changes after a regime transition, in particular, from autocratic to democratic rule, but also reciprocally. Using a global dataset on women's representation from 1946 to 2014 including more than 140 regime changes, we establish through descriptive and inferential statistics that most regime changes, regardless of the nature of the transition involved, do not improve the representation of women.

DE Youth culture; youth in transition; subcultures; resistance; new
   identities
ID GENERATIONS; SUBCULTURE; SKINHEADS; CRITIQUE; CULTURES
AB In youth studies, a clear distinction is made between theories on youth in transition and theories of youth culture. Whereas theories and research on youth transitions often use quantitative data (and therefore need to operationalize their 'variables') - cultural studies uses various qualitative methods, alongside a more elastic definition of, and conceptual approach to, young people's socio-material living conditions. The argument made in the present article is that we need a theoretical renewal in youth studies that will enable us to thoroughly explore class, gender and ethnicity in light of the intersections between social and cultural positions. At the same time, we also need to elaborate our conceptual tools to capture contemporary transformations of social identity among youth and in society and culture. The aim is to reintroduce three central concepts in the renewal of youth studies, that of identity, subculture and resistance. Furthermore, it is imperative that connect and create links between these concepts and theories of youth in transition.

First displaying its history, it examines how the economy of such a sport was born, focusing on the principles and values of capitalism and then creating the 'bodybuilding's industry'. In particular, the article stresses the gendered dimension of such an industry relying on 'hegemonic masculinity', especially through the relevant media, which are at the core of this gendered framework. I use a qualitative methodology to understand the subject, analyzing the French magazines related to bodybuilding, which embodies the whole functioning of such an industry.

DE Comparative religion; Culture Science of Religion; no religion; Science

AB Despite several complaints that what passes for Religious Studies represents liberal theology in disguise, the reworked Platonist religion of the twentieth century, which drives that theology, remains to be adequately exposed. This needs to be done if the Science of Religion is to recognize its own origins, and so at last move on to the non-theological cultural studies science that has been in preparation. The first half of this article elicits the Platonist faith enjoyed by Max Muller and illustrates the consistent application of religious anthropology to the present day through key figures such as Mircea Eliade, Peter Berger and Robert Bellah. The conclusion of this review confirms that the Science of Religion has been a confession of faith in disguise: it is Platonist theology posing as the Science of Religion. The second half of the article proposes a clear distinction between the two methodologically incommensurate perspectives of Platonist Science of Religion, and (Humanist) Culture Science of Religion. To draw together elements of a distinguishing methodology in a future Culture Science of Religion, Clifford Geertz's definition of religion as a cultural system is taken up and incorporated into a reciprocal relationship with culture. This is stated as: cosmos confirms culture.

AB Human rights (HR), from the perspective of interest and thematic selection, are recognized in the topics of the communication. In general, there is considered to be a positive relationship between the media and its function of mediation with citizenship in reference to the declared general principles since inception in 1948. With this approach, the paper deals with providing an updated reflection of that connection and its main difficulties, such as the crisis of credibility in the information in the context of the European Union and within the framework of the paradigm changes that has derived in the knowledge society of the so-called third environment. The precepts of those recognized as generations of HR survive in the informational stories, of which, due to their current relevance in recent decades, those related to migratory movements, inequality, and poverty stands out. Moreover, the paper explores and discusses how a new generation derived from the implementation and intervention of technology gets involved as an essential characteristic in the relations between the members of society.

DE Migration; media; humanitarian narratives; public campaigns
AB This paper investigates the media's role in shaping perceptions and policies concerning the so-called migrant crisis as well as how this affects solidarity with newcomers, specifically focusing on Italy. The first part of the paper examines the coexistence of the humanitarian narratives of saving lives and the spectacle of militarised borders. It unveils how the daily transmission of sensationalist and stereotyped images of migrants contributes to their transforming into subjects and objects of fear, both experiencing the fear of being rejected and eliminated and inspiring fear in the resident populations. The second part addresses the need for innovative approaches in the construction of a positive public image of migrants and refugees. Through an analysis of several communication campaigns, realised by state and non-state actors for the promotion of social coexistence between citizens and newcomers, this paper calls for a fundamental shift in the way we communicate about migration. A concluding reflection on the challenges and opportunities posed by the arrival of migrants and asylum seekers in our societies, proposes that they should not only be perceived as objects of policies, but should be considered active partners of their own inclusion in the receiving societies.

DE Statelessness; refugees; U.N.H.C.R.; human rights; citizenship
AB In her The Origins of Totalitarianism, Hannah Arendt described the condition of apolidia (statelessness) - through words that still resonate today - as that of persons who have lost their rights because they have fled their homeland. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (U.N.H.C.R.), there are about 10 million stateless persons worldwide, 600,000 of whom live in the European Union (E.U.). It seems impossible to imagine the concept of statelessness, which although it has a very specific definition in international law, remains a vague notion for the intellect and common sense. This paper will firstly focus on the historical evolution of the concept of nationality under international law. Secondly, it will deal with the international legal framework, and in particular the 1954 and 1961 Conventions on the improvement of the conditions of stateless persons and the prevention of statelessness. It will then turn to the U.N.H.C.R.'s mandate in relation to statelessness, and how this organization contributes to the promotion of an effective right to nationality. Finally, U.N.H.C.R.'s communication campaigns to end statelessness will be analyzed, in order to stress the positive impact of an effective communication strategy.

She is known for her studies in European Cultural History, and in 2007 she published the book Inventing Human Rights, where she examines the rise of the human rights in the eighteenth century.
   We are specifically interested in her work because it gives us the chance to create a dialogue and disclose the moment we are living in comparing it with the cultural history and the role the media can have during a humanitarian crisis.
   Therefore, we ask Lynn Hunt to explain how the exodus of migrants can be interpreted in light of the meta-narrative model, and to make clear what is and what will be the role of the cultural historians in offering us an interpretation of this historical moment. According to what the writer says in Writing History in the Global Era (2014), Hunt also deals with the importance of the relationship between means of communication, development of empathy and the emergence of human rights. For this reason, we asked the researcher, What is the role of the media today in mapping a humanitarian crisis?

DE Migration; media; humanitarian narratives; solidarity; Europe
AB Lilie Chouliaraki is Professor of Media and Communications at the London School of Economics and Political Science. She has a background in Languages and Linguistics and her research has a strong interdisciplinary orientation, drawing on social and cultural theory, moral philosophy and sociology, visual communication and discourse theory. Her main interest lies in understanding how the media shape our ethical and political relationship to distant others; how they inform the ways we witness the vulnerability of these others and the ways we are invited to feel, think and act towards them. In 2006, she published The spectatorship of suffering, which is a seminal piece of work within the field of Media Studies, opening up the domain of mediated suffering studies. In 2013, Lilie published The ironic spectator: solidarity in the age of post-humanitarianism, which was awarded the Outstanding Book of the Year Prize by ICA 2015, and has been widely reviewed and acclaimed. In this recent work, Chouliaraki explores how digital media are today changing the traditional relationship between humanitarian practice and politics, focusing on the ways humanitarian agencies try to - and fail to - combine a dominant market logic with a political vision of justice and social change.

AB Stephane Jacquemet, Regional Representative for Southern Europe of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (U.N.H.C.R.) since April 2016, agreed to answer some questions regarding U.N.H.C.R.'s mandate and positions in relation to the so-called 'European migration crisis'. Mr Jacquemet is a Swiss Lawyer who has been working with the U.N.H.C.R. for 24 years. In 1992 he was called as Head of Operations in Croatia, and during his career he served in Togo, Indonesia, Lebanon, Nepal, Burkina Faso, and Colombia. Between 1997 and 2002 Mr Jacquemet held a number of senior positions in the Division of International Protection at U.N.H.C.R. Headquarters in Geneva. This rare and invaluable combination of legal and practical expertise makes Mr Jacquemet a first-class interlocutor whom to ask some questions concerning, on the one hand, the E.U. policies towards migrants, and, on the other, U.N.H.C.R.'s strategies in relation to the promotion of refugees' and statelessness persons' rights.

TI Logic of order: state hierarchy, law, sovereignty, and war

DT Article
DE Social structure; power hierarchy; legal system; global order; war
ID RESPONSIBILITY; GLOBALIZATION
AB While natural sciences such as physics hold causality for granted as one of the most fundamental principles to make adequate theories of the real world, social sciences, first of all, sociology have not this advantage. Of course, humans are subjected to causality insofar as they are physical entities too, but moreover they are endowed with free will that essentially complicates their behavior and social activity. Unlike causality, logistics should take the same place in social sciences. Conscious beings behave rationally and act logistically as well as they possess some physical experience (including causality) and socially structured knowledge. Thus, free will is restricted not only by causality and other physical laws but also logistics. This paper argues for a logistical approach to the society and models the state as a power hierarchy (mathematical ideal). The state can exist, function, and be stable over time only as a hierarchy. Then sovereignty emerges as a logistical phenomenon whose 'dynamical magnitude' is naturally decomposed by the societal strata of the society and the mankind as a whole. Further, any state-based legal system (SLS) can be analyzed in structuralism tradition by means of logical-algebraic modeling. When the states as a set of the self-sufficient (logistically complete) sovereign hierarchies confront in the international law field (ILF) it leads inevitably to incompleteness of the ILF. In sum, the logistical theorem on war can be elicited.

AB The study examined challenges of sending remittances and factors that motivate migrants to send remittances to Isiekenesi. Survey research design was adopted for the study. Using multi-stage sampling method for the quantitative data of the study, 402 questionnaires were distributed to the study participants and 395 were retrieved; 17 interviews and three focus group discussions (qualitative data) were conducted. Insecurity, the high cost of the transfer of remittances, lack of social amenities and so on were noted as challenges that undermine the flow of remittances to Isiekenesi. Factors that motivate migrants to send remittances to Isiekenesi are the desire to improve the family living standard, improved security in the home country, the need for recognition and the economic situation of the home country among others. Finally, the study has clearly shown that remittances in Isiekenesi are typically altruistic as migrants see it as a means of providing economic support to individual recipients at home to improve their living standard.

AB Social support influences the subject's well-being through various mechanisms. Literature shows that the partner is one of the main sources of social support. Nevertheless, sometimes people do not ask their partners first for help. Our aim is to determine what factors (values related to the family, personal characteristics and availability of resources) influence this decision. We use Spanish representative samples from International Social Survey Programme (2001) and Spain's Center for Sociological Research (2010). Data show that family solidarity is widespread in Spanish society. The determinants for not turning first to the partner are the availability and frequent contact with immediate kin, whereas family values and personal characteristics are less relevant.

AB This paper explores dimensions of collectivism to explain patterns of reporting organizational wrongdoing in public organizations. The findings herein illustrate that responses to wrongdoing in public organizations in developing countries like Kenya are more rationalized or interpreted within communitarian or supported by parochial social ideologies, which tend to override instrumental accountability norms and structures. Accordingly, responses towards organizational wrongdoing are more informed by the logic of appropriateness, as potential and actual complainants prefer informal channels for addressing organizational wrongdoing over formal reporting mechanisms. These findings present important insights for designing accountability mechanisms or anti-corruption strategies in public organizations. With a focus on unfamiliar settings to the literature on ethical culture, the paper rides on its in-depth analysis while contributing to the current research on organizational behavior and decision-making.

DE Care-workers market; blood ties; intense relationships; kinship vs.
   relatedness
ID KINSHIP; FAMILY; EUROPE
AB Taking their cue from a seeming dissonance between the theory of commodification and exploitation of migrant care workers and the case study of the outsourced self proposed by Hochschild, the author speculates whether or not the family-caregiver relationship may be equal and inclusive. The argument is unraveled by posing another question en route: what specific 'catalysts' can trigger 'high-intensity affective relationships'? Elster defines 'essentially byproduct' the result of a process lacking any direct and conscious link between outcome and intention, and requiring the relaxation of the control of reason in order to be fulfilled. The author mixes significant theoretical results coming both from the relational Palo Alto School and from history of families studies, concluding that an equal and inclusive relationship may be like an Elster's 'essentially byproduct' of a market relationship, when a high-intensity affective relation acts as a 'catalyst'. The frame suggested in this article seems consistent with recent constructionist reinterpretations of the idea of kinship, which take shape and evolve through 'everyday experiences'. Kinship thus shifts towards a more complex undefined category, that of Karsten's relatedness. Speaking of which, the author argues some logical reasons suggesting a generalized adoption of the term only with great care and caution.

AB This article proposes a gendered critique of the European Neighbourhood Policy, a framework that, amongst other things, aims to facilitate the mobility of migrants to the EU from the bordering countries. We highlight the ambivalences of European gender and migration regimes, and we take issue with the celebration of the 'feminisation of migration'. The former fails to offer opportunities to women to safely embark on autonomous migratory projects, the latter contributes to reproduce traditional gender biases in the countries of origin as well as of destination. We conclude by suggesting that the EU critique to emigration countries for failing to tackle women's discrimination is less than persuasive when assessed vis-a-vis with the curtailment on women's independent mobility across European borders.

DE Migration; female; Germany; Italian; labour-market; inclusion/exclusion;

AB Already at the beginning of the fifties on the initiative of Italy, negotiations began between the Italian and German governments for the recruitment of migrant-workers, which ended in 1955 with a bilateral agreement between the two countries. Through this recruitment policy and because of the labour-market (Industry and Building) the Italian migration was composed prevalently of men. Female immigration happened in the setting of family reunification and less as an independent movement project. After years of stagnation of italian emigration in the eighties it may also be noted that, since the early nineties, there has been a revival of immigration to Germany. This and modernisation processes in Italy changed the gender composition of the Italian immigration flow to Germany: the distance between male and female immigration is decreasing. A peculiarity of the Italians in Germany is the low occupational participation of women in comparison with other women from EU countries. However, we could observe regional differences, which depend on the migration typologies and the dominating economic structure in the areas. The paper will analyse this different aspects (immigration-processes, migranttypologies and labour-market participation) by female Italian migrants.

ID SEGREGATION
AB In recent decades, social movements have expanded their range of action, adopting a more global perspective. Although many studies have been made of varied national and transnational movements, it still remains a little-studied field that involves the participation of immigrants, especially women, in social movements in Italy. These movements involve various problem areas. The thematic focus of our research is the housing, at the national level, and our chosen case study regards the situation as it presents itself in Rome. At a time when there seems to be less public interest in economic, social and cultural rights in favor of a broader interest in individual rights, studying the role of immigrant women in the participation of foreign communities in social movements for housing rights can encourage and support a renewed attention to this area, also because of the changing social composition of the resident population, and the emergence of old and new forms of poverty, of which the incoming immigration flows are one of the main causes. As we can see, the figure of the immigrant transforms the housing problem into a problem of co-habitation, or even better, of co-existence.

AB This paper investigates the multiple dimensions in the identity constructions of the daughters of the Muslim migrations to Italy. It focuses on the transformations in the way girls and young women relate to religion, in the transition from the generation of mothers, who emigrated from countries with a Muslim majority, to the generation of daughters, who grow up in a European context where Islam is a minority religion. It discusses 'transmissions', 'translations' and 'betrayals' in the migration experience, from a standpoint which highlights the specificities of gender and of generation. The article is based on an intersectional analysis of biographical accounts by Muslim girls and young women of Bengali and Moroccan origin who were born and/or grew up in Italy. Intersecting religious identity with other identity lines such as national belonging (to the parents' country of origin and to the country where they were born or grew up), gender, class, color and age, multiple reactions and positions emerged. In this context, the religious dimension inherited/experienced/reinvented/called into question by the daughters of migrations appeared to be in constant evolution. Indeed, the stories contained herein of young Muslims tell of the emergence of European Islam.

AB In today's complex, intercultural, transnational, glocalized world, linking conceptual analyses and theoretical representations to the empirical study of female migration also requires, among other aspects, acknowledging the importance of the arrival context in the redefinition of gender roles, since it operates as an area of opportunity or containment mainly due to a number of specific features, which interacts with women's economic, cultural and social capital, to produce different results in the situation of migrant women. The context of arrival and the subjects, conceived of as actors inserted in social structures where they have scope for action, is the focus of our analysis. This article addresses this issue through the study of two cases of migrant women in different contexts. One of the women is a Mexican migrant who settled in Sonoma County California in the US, and the other a Bulgarian who arrived in Ribera del Duero in the Autonomous Community of Castile and Leon in Spain. The research used mixed methods, which included the review of various censuses and documentary sources, ethnographic fieldwork and the qualitative technique of the life story to undertake the case studies.

DE Suicide attacks; rational choice theory; gender; Middle East; Chechnya
ID TERRORISM; BOMBERS; IRAQ; ATTACKS
AB The theories of rational choice have been widely used in analysing suicide bombings. Such a use is here critically examined along three lines. First, the limits of this theoretical framework when applied to sacrificial violence are assessed and especially the internal contradictions which appear with the notion of 'symbolic posthumous rewards'. Second, differences emerge in the use of rational choice theory when the focus is upon female suicide bombers. Indeed, deprivation theories come then to the fore, the idea of personal crisis and the impact of patriarchal social relationships. This switch in the analysis, which does not seem based on differences in the data, confirms gender studies which underline the specific difficulty to envisage female political violence. Finally, to go beyond both reductionisms, a compared analysis of suicide attacks in Chechnya, Iraq and Israel/Palestine is proposed. It aims at restituting the context of action and the narratives at work, making a clear distinction between two levels of analysis, the one of the organizations, which can largely be understood in terms of their strategic rationale, and that of the suicide bombers themselves, for whom it seems more heuristic to use the concepts of narratives and horizons of expectation.

DT Article
DE New institutionalism; social theory; institution; organisation;
   political economy; complex interplay theory
AB This paper addresses the use, and potential misuse, of the 'institution' as a key concept in sociology. The concept of the 'institution' is interrogated using 'family' as an example and new institutional economics (NIE) as a crucible. The sociological understanding of family as an 'institution' is challenged by the distinction between 'institutions' and 'organisations' in NIE. The blurring of generic non-sociological terms with critical sociological concepts causes confusion between institutions and organisations. This is highly problematic for understanding social change in increasingly complex systems. I conclude that the contextual embedding of sociological concepts remains important to the appropriate use of the term 'institution' in the social sciences.

DE Model family method; minimum income schemes; social assistance;

ID WELFARE
AB This article focuses on the application of a specific comparative methodology, the model family method (MFM), in measuring the income derived from minimum income schemes. The application of the MFM to the analysis of this policy field shows several criticalities such as the difficulty to analyze countries in which no national scheme exists, and in which both the intra-national variations and the discretionary power of street-level bureaucrats are significant. Stemming from the application of the MFM to the Italian case in the framework of an international project, the article analyzes whether and how this method can be developed also in said countries. In particular, it shows that, in order to do so, specific methodological choices and assumptions are necessary, built on a mixed research strategy aimed at complementing the data collected from institutional sources with in-depth interviews with social workers and the use of the vignettes technique.

AB This paper seeks to demonstrate to what extent an academic approach that borrows from economics and sociology is heuristic in terms of fully understanding monetary issues. Contrary to authors that consider money to be neutral, this article emphasizes that money is a 'total social fact'. Hence, it focuses on three meanings of money through the theoretical framework of Schumpeter and various French institutionalists. It also focuses on the Swiss case, which is particularly relevant because money plays a significant role in order for such a country to foster prosperity and create social links. Finally, there is clearly a high usefulness of a pluralistic approach on the monetary issue for heterodox economists.

AB Seeds are both the means and product of agricultural production. The corporate appropriation of seeds affects farmers' autonomy and has been contested and resisted by farmers worldwide through practices of repossession. This article investigates different practices of the repossession of seeds emphasising the micro-structure and recent developments in agricultural practices that lead to a commonisation of seeds. Various practices of seed repossession present in India are analysed and compared with open-source initiatives to present examples of the diversity of singular initiatives aimed at the commonisation of seeds in the Global South. The article shows that each initiative applies a multitude of concrete practices to counter what we will refer to as metabolic rift, but without a single generic strategy, each seeking in its own way to repossess seeds and (re) locate them in a social space of commons.

ID CRITIQUE; CULTURE; HE
AB This paper examines global English-language newspaper coverage of the death of David Bowie. Drawing upon the concept of reification, it is argued that the notion of celebrity is discursively (re) produced and configured through a 'public face' that is defined, maintained and shaped via media reports and public responses that aim to know and reflect upon celebrity. The findings highlight how Bowie's reification was supported by discourses that represented him as an observable, reified form. Here, Bowie's 'reality', that is, his authentic/veridical self, was obscured behind a facade of mediation, interpretation and representation that debated and decided his 'authenticity' as a cultural icon. Such debates, however, were engagements with a reified image, enveloped in continual (re) interpretation. As a result, Bowie's reification was grounded in a polysemous process that allowed numerous versions of 'himself' to be aesthetically reimagined, reinvented and repeated.

DT Editorial Material
DE Gender equality; family policies; work-family balance; cultural
   dimensions
AB The Southern countries model (Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Greece) take a specific family-oriented approach to work-family reconciliation. They are family-oriented in that they entrust the family with more responsibilities that in other countries. Work-family reconciliation is considered as a political action that gives quite limited and unstable support to encourage women's labour-market participation; this results in the poor development of external services and in few benefits for women, who have to undertake multiple roles inside and outside the family. In these countries, negotiation is left to the private spheres of the couple or local communities, so that each family can decide on the best way to use the existing policies and consider the possibilities available to them. In this sense it is not possible only to apply 'outside models' (such as the Nordic, French, German, etc.) to find an effective approach for these countries. The special issue, starting from the current situation explores possibilities for future scenarios in Southern Europe countries concerning work-family dynamics. It includes general comparative papers or case study on work-care arrangements, family and care policies, early childhood education and care (ECEC) with regard to family well-being, gender equality, fertility or father involvement in Southern European countries.

DT Article
DE Official statistics; ambivalence; rationalization; emancipation;
   quantification
AB The purpose of this paper is to advance some theoretical-methodological propositions about analyzing official statistics in the contemporary world: it is going to underline how the category of ambivalence is important in order to improve our comprehension of official statistics. In the second section, we will give a brief overview on contemporary sociology of official statistics. In the third and fourth sections, the focus will be on the 'French theory' - probably, the hegemonic current now - starting from Pierre Bourdieu's analysis of the State, one of the most important issues in order to better understand this perspective. This analysis points out as French theory considers just rationalization processes. Control, dominion as well as alienation are the main subjects, a set of ideas based on a structuralist point of view which does not actually consider the possibility of social change. The ambivalence (or social contradiction in Marxism terms) of every sociopolitical process - including the making and using of official statistics - is systematically underestimated. Beyond the dominion there is the subject and the conflict in a shared field of historicity: ethic and social claims need official statistics too. Eventually, the fifth section will focus on our theoretical-methodological proposal based on re-embedding the category of the statistical system in a more complex vision where ambivalence is essential.

DE Population census; new data culture; register-based statistics;
   administrative data mining; unobtrusive methods
AB Changes in technology, society and individual behaviours are having impressive effects on data production and use. Social networks, sensors and data infrastructure are generating a massive amount of new data (big data, big corpora, linked data, open data, etc.) that are readily available for the analysis of societies. Official statistics too is starting to pay attention to these unofficial data sources, to the aim of using them within the production processes. Despite the potentials of new data for statistical production, so far we can depict two main effects on official statistics, and especially on population censuses. First of all, there is the digitalization of data construction through both new instruments (e.g. web questionnaires) and new means of collection (e.g. tablets). Furthermore, the integration and the scaling-up of data archives is ongoing. This transition from the traditional 'door-to-door' census to new census methods, which make an higher use of technology, is not only a technical result, but it reflects the extent to which digital data are changing the routines of production of statistics and their use to gain social knowledge.

DT Article
DE Politics of statistics; poverty; Ethiopia; legitimacy
AB There are contradictory statistics about the number of poor people and changes in number of poor people in Ethiopia with statistics ranging from 26 to 86% of the total population in 2013. This paper analyzed how such contradictory statistics feed into national politics focusing on who uses which statistics and based on what justifications of authoritativeness. Drawing from data collected from print newspapers, blogs, websites, published articles, party publications, and interviews with four key informants and combining an actor's centered discourse analysis (ACDA) with Van Dick's (1997) approach of identifying and analyzing political discourses, the paper deconstructed the poverty statistics debate in Ethiopia to understand the basic contestations. Synthesis of the data shows that poverty numbers are being used as tools for, and manifestations of, ongoing power struggles in Ethiopia whereby different actors selectively use poverty statistics that promote their political agenda. While doing so, the underlying rationale of actors for choosing one statistics over another was not based on the merit of their preferred set of statistics over the others but on the suitability of the data for their political purpose. As such, the government disregards statistics except its own which portray rapid poverty decline in the country while opposition groups actively use and promote statistics coming from international organizations that depict increasing poverty or a slow rate of reduction of poverty. The paper argues that the underlying cause of such politicization of numbers is linked with the developmental statism ideology of the ruling party in Ethiopia and how it tries to justify its rule in Ethiopia - claiming that it is reducing poverty and bringing development in Ethiopia and therefore should be allowed to continue in power. Therefore, in debating poverty numbers what is being debated is not just the statistics but the legitimacy of the government, hence politics by numbers.

AB Gender statistics play a crucial role in social research and in the creation of gender sensitive policies. Gender statistics document the situation of women and men around the world, making it easier to raise awareness about inequalities between them, to monitor gender equality and promote actionable change. There is thus a need to encourage awareness about gender statistics and their usefulness in gender mainstreaming. The paper has different aims: (1) to discuss the role of gender statistics and gender sensitive indicators; (2) to give an overview of the main gender sensitive European databases; (3) to present the European Commission Strategy on Gender Equality; (4) to display information collected by the European Institute for Gender Equality (Eige) database; (5) to promote proposal for increasing the gender sensitivity of social indicators.

ID HIGHER-EDUCATION; ACCOUNTABILITY; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT
AB Modern societies have a growing need for information and numbers for governing social life. Numbers have the ability to represent a complex reality in a simplified and linear form, easily communicated. Far from being the product of a mere technical process, numbers are the result of a process that "is fundamentally social - an artifact of human action, imagination, ambition, accomplishment" (Espeland, W.N., and Stevens, M.L., 2008. A sociology of quantification. European journal of sociology, 49 (3), 401-436, p. 431). In the modern policy-making climate, numbers become key mechanisms for simplifying, classifying, comparing and evaluating. Along with this, the fields of visibility of evaluative objects, meanings and understandings (Dean, M., 2010. Governmentality. Power and rule in modern societies. 2nd ed. London: Sage) are re-framed consistently with what Clarke, J. (2004. Changing welfare, changing states. New direction in social policy. London: Sage) terms a 'performance/evaluation nexus' that links effort, values, purposes and self-understanding to measures and comparisons of outputs (Ball, S.J., 2012. Performativity, commodification and commitment: an I-Spy guide to the neoliberal university. British journal of educational studies, 601, 17-28). In this paper, we focus on the field of higher education (HE), where numbers, in the form of performance indicators, benchmarks and headline targets, are frequently used to strategically orient the sector towards the objectives and goals of the Bologna Process and of the overall Europe 2020 agenda (Waldow, F., 2014. From taylor to tyler to no child left behind: legitimating educational standards. Prospects, 45 (1), 49-62). We aim to offer a comparative overview of the complex spectrum of metrics, provided at the supranational level, within the field of higher education by focusing on the European Research Area (ERA) in order to map and analyse some of the crucial issues in play. A second ambition of this paper is to move from a mapping and analytical perspective to a deconstruction of a specific subset of research metrics, with the aim of challenging the 'self-evident truths' and the dominant conventional wisdom that define current European metrics in order to bring into question whether they contribute to restructuring the universities' research environments, affecting research policies and procedures. Performance indicators are posited to be 'conceptual technologies', encompassing theoretical and normative assumptions that shape the objects they aspire to measure.

AB Statistics are impossible without concepts. As the sociologist of invention Colum Gilfillan put it in 1952, 'counting begins with definition of the thing to be counted'. This article is concerned with statistics on science, technology and innovation (STI). It documents how official statisticians have, over time, defined the concepts used for measurement. Debates on definitions of the concepts measured started at the very beginning of STI measurement in the first half of the twentieth century. Then, from the early 1960s onward, methodological manuals were developed to conventionalize the definitions. This article claims that the manuals did not have the expected result. They did not stabilize the definitions and the statistics based thereon.

AB There is currently an increasing amount of research on online fatherhood. In this article, we have used international blogs as our empirical data, in order to investigate and create an in-depth picture of fatherhood as it is expressed in various men's stories about their everyday lives. Three distinct conceptions of fatherhood and masculinity emerge. The first of these positions could be described as a nostalgic position in relation to hegemonic masculinity. The second position is referred to here as complicity. This position indicates a changing landscape of fatherhood and family politics, moving towards gender-equal conditions. Thirdly, we have an inclusive position that reflects a gender-neutral position, and are understood less in terms of masculinity, heteronormativity and gender-divided responsibilities.

DE Sociology of sport; disability; discrimination; categorisation; mass

AB Oscar Pistorius presents a major issue to sports organisations, as exposed in the media. First and foremost, media wrongly perceive him as the first disabled athlete to participate in the Olympic Games. Second, they openly question the legitimacy of his participation mainly based on the inequity introduced by his prosthetic legs. Content analysis, in English and French, of written press, International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) texts, from 2004 to 2012, confirms that Pistorius presents a new puzzle to sports organizations. This is partly because they are not able to determine whether his performances are a result of his body strength or if they are biased by his artificial limbs. Furthermore, when he is competing against able-bodied athletes, sports organizsations put him in a 'monstrous' position. Similarly, while categorising him as an 'athlete' they do not grant him the characteristic feature of this category: certified comparability of performances to ultimately establish ranks.

DE Conflict; gender equality; women's movements; Egypt
ID ARMED CONFLICT; WOMEN; ARAB; POLITICS
AB Analyzing the changes to gender equality in the wake of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, this manuscript evaluates whether civil conflict creates new openings for women's empowerment. Recently, the literature has considered civil conflict a potentially powerful, transformative force in women's social and political inclusion. Given Egypt's comparatively low performance in gender equality achievements and policies, the 2011 Revolution creates a critical opportunity to evaluate the transformative power of conflict. The analysis shows that the Egyptian revolution was transformative of legislation on behalf of women's physical security; women saw gains emerge in this area of legislation from processes connected to the revolution. Pre and post-test, qualitative and quantitative evidence suggest that the key mechanism through which such transformation occurred was the strengthening of the local women's movement. This is demonstrated through a critical analysis of the various mechanisms of change highlighted in the growing literature on conflict and gender equality. However, the analysis also reveals that the lack of women's formal representation and the seizure of power by Islamic forces contributed to setbacks that inhibited further-reaching change during the transition.

The religious factor is secondary. To combat terrorism and extremism which is spreading in the MENA region requires political will.

AB Over the past decades, social enterprises have been acknowledged as key welfare actors in several EU countries. In spite of the dramatic research devoted to exploring them, several issues concerning the definition, drivers and roles played by policies in sustaining social enterprise growth are still highly contested. Drawing on the papers published in this Monographic section, the introduction to this issue reconstructs the debate that has accompanied the emergence and development of social enterprises with a view to providing evidence of the advantages of collective participation for social enterprise emergence and growth. Next, the introduction pays attention to the factors that have led to the emergence and success of social enterprises as a form of self-organization of civil society; and briefly describes the papers included in this issue.

AB This article provides indirect empirical evidence with which to verify whether the logic of collective action maintained by Olson represents a sound theoretical approach to social enterprises. Our hypothesis is that, if a positive effect of participation in social enterprises on pro-social attitudes of members exists, when considering these organizations we should move from the approach proposed by Olson to the one proposed by Putnam, in the Tocqueville tradition. Overall, the existing empirical and experimental evidence seems to suggest that Putnam's approach to voluntary organizations is better able than Olson's to capture the organizational behavior of social enterprises, confirming that initiatives by self-organized citizens should be considered a possible convincing explanation for their emergence.

AB Social cooperatives are the most widespread social enterprise type in Italy. Their evolution has stimulated the development of diverse interpretative frameworks of social enterprise determinants: the mainstream one is that social cooperatives are the outcome of contracting out policies. Through a critical investigation of social cooperatives' emergence, integration into public policies, and reaction to the financial crisis, the authors refocus attention to one of the key modes of creation of social enterprises that has not gained the attention it deserves: the bottom-up dynamic. The analysis carried out sheds light on the contribution of citizens' mobilization to institutional change and confirms that social enterprises can also emerge in an unprepared and hostile ideological, economic and political context.

There existed distinct patterns of emergence and evolution of cooperative elderly care from grass roots. Consumer co-ops started to train consumer members as care-givers and entered the care business while health co-ops made a substantial investment to build facilities and manpower for elderly care as a natural extension. Workers co-operatives were organized to provide elderly care to the increasing number of care receivers.

AB Almost all children in Sweden spend at least some part of their early childhood in organized childcare, primarily in the form of preschools. About 10% of all preschools in Sweden are parent cooperatives, which make the childcare area an anomaly in the Swedish welfare state; no other service area has such a significant proportion of cooperative service providers. The parent cooperatives are initiated by the parents themselves, they are social enterprises created from the bottom-up. Why do parents decide to start a parent cooperative preschool in a welfare state where childcare is considered a social right and a responsibility for the state? This article will explore several different motives for starting parent cooperatives in Sweden, with special attention to the role of the public sector and political decisions. The findings are based on an extensive empiric study performed between the years 2003 and 2007.

AB Political trust has been in decline in China. In this article, we capture this decline as reflecting the modernization of Chinese political culture. While the government managed to deliver a sustained period of rapid economic growth, the public's trust in it is diminishing through two mechanisms. On the one hand, Chinese citizens are acquiring stronger liberal democratic values, which make citizens more critical toward government institutions. On the other hand, changing political culture is also shown in the citizens' shifting of their priorities toward the expansion of freedom and empowerment of citizens. Decades of socioeconomic modernization, therefore, meant that the era of critical citizens has arrived in China.

ID RETURNS
AB The central theme of this article is the relationship between formal education and earnings from a longitudinal perspective, taking into account indicators of social status. Variations in the respective trajectories, in different age cohorts, and in the comparison among different periods are discussed. The empirical material used is based on the microdata files of official statistics. The main techniques put into practice are those that are most focused on measuring the degree of interdependence among variables and those used for means comparison. Our general hypothesis is that the effects of schooling cannot be grasped in terms of education itself but instead in terms of its relationship to status in the social and power structures. One of this paper's principal observations is that of the general declining trend in the economic value of formal education, which varies depending on the level of education and social status. This devaluation is systematic and spans the entire studied universe; however, it focuses much more closely on those of lower social status, particularly for the groups with schooling that is either higher or lower than average.

AB A sizable body of literature reports that social capital, derived from relational resources embedded in micro social contexts, is crucial for student achievement. This study aimed to examine whether this applies as well to socioeconomically disadvantaged immigrant adolescents in the US. In so doing, the study first identified the types of relational features that were strongly associated with immigrant adolescents' academic achievement, before exploring how high-and low-achieving immigrant adolescents coming from similarly socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds differed in terms of these relational features. To this end, the study used the dataset of the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS). There was a significantly positive association found between academic achievement and a number of positive characteristics of social relationships with friends and teachers. In addition, a significant disparity in these relational features was found between high and low achievers among the socioeconomically disadvantaged. The findings illuminate the salience of peer contexts and of interpersonal trust in shaping immigrant adolescents' educational outcomes in a way that transcends socioeconomic boundaries. It is pertinent for educators and policy-makers to empower immigrant youth as independent agents capable of generating academically relevant social capital on their own outside their families and ethnic communities.

DE Social enterprise; ecosystems; social policy; political devolution
ID CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK
AB Social enterprise has been identified as a culturally and socially constructed phenomenon; over recent years there has been increasing focus on how social enterprise 'ecosystems' differ across countries. There has been less focus on the differences in social enterprise ecosystems within countries, where regional differences in the cultural, political and social environment can lead to variations in the environment for support. Recent devolution within the United Kingdom has led to all four countries developing fairly diverse political and policy environments. This paper explores these differences through the lens of evolutionary theory which posits that within an ecosystem all organisms are a product of the evolution of that ecosystem and that socio-political and regulatory differences can lead to the rapid divergence of social enterprise ecosystems.

After a review of the history of social and solidarity economy practices, identifying the processes that brought these practices to develop, we discuss the boundaries of the notion of social enterprise in the French case. We then briefly present the historical evolution of work integration. On that basis, two models of social enterprise applied to the case of work integration are extracted, crystallizing crucial tendencies. The limits and prospects of social enterprise in the field of work integration in France are discussed in the conclusion.

DE Mutual aid associations; mutualism; third sector; social economy;
   bottom-up social enterprise
AB The purpose of this article is to present and analyze the organizational profile and distinctive development pattern of a successful bottom-up social enterprise in Romania, namely, the Retirees' Mutual Aid Association (RMAA). Romania has recently rediscovered the world of social economy which brings together various organizations, from associations and foundations to cooperatives and commons, sharing a common interest in developing entrepreneurial activities to support social goals. In an ideological and public policy context which holds back the opening of the public market to the third sector and social economy actors, setting and running up such organizations remains a challenge. On the other hand, the isomorphic pressure exerted by the EU has resulted in a type of legislation targeted at social enterprises which focuses almost exclusively on work integration social enterprises. Nonetheless, Romania also features social enterprises that are not externally driven but developed bottom-up, starting from the needs of their members and of the communities in which they are established and developed. Using the data of extensive research conducted on social economy entities in Romania, we will present an organizational case study of a successful bottom-up social enterprise, namely RMAA.

AB The article focuses on inter-firm relations, primarily seen as protective devises crafted for keeping at an arm's length various kinds of uncertainties involved in boundary transactions. Taking a holistic view, it proposes the notion of relational habitat, which refers to the relatively durable constellation of relations that connect a given firm to its main business partners. Performing a double-edged protective function, this constellation both stabilizes and simplifies the immediate operational domain of the firm and, thereby, diminishes to manageable levels the complexity of the relevant parts of the environment. By expanding the control of the firm beyond its organizational borders, relational habitat reduces the constraining impact of boundary uncertainty and enhances the action capacity of the firm - facilitating the materialization of its chosen line of action and its desired objectives. The article specifies this notion in detail and highlights some of its implications, both for the theoretical development of economic sociology and for its relation to economics.

AB Southern Mediterranean area, particularly the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), has been facing social, economic, environmental and political challenges related to the water scarcity and quality. Within the European SWMED project, a socio-economic survey was conducted in Palestine and Tunisia, in order to explore the water conditions, and the social and economic situations of local families. The article illustrates the research design and implementation, as well as the main results that were used to select the appropriate sustainable water management solutions to respond to the hydropolitical issues. Due to the huge use of water in agriculture and the difficulty of reducing the water consumption in this sector, fostering tools for domestic water saving may be a winning strategy for facing water scarcity in MENA region.

DE Women trafficking; sex industry; sexual exploitation; identity crisis
   and Mexico
AB The main objective of this paper is to explore how sexual violence and exploitation cause identity crisis among victims of sex-trafficking in Mexico. Trafficking is a widespread phenomenon, where girls and women are forced or coerced into sexual exploitation. Victims of trafficking acquire not only adverse physical health; also there is a higher impact on emotional and psychological health and leads women to an 'identity crisis'. Once they're brought into brothel, their body is controlled by pimps, and seen as a source of income through prostitution. As Bauman said; commodification and consumption of female bodies is indeed useful to explain an individual's fragile identity. Moreover, my own scholarly interest in women trafficking has led me to turn towards defining the identity crisis among these victims as it is directly related to sexual exploitation. For this study, a total of 60 women were interviewed during 2007-2013 using a snowball method.

DT Article
DE Islam in Europe; German Muslim youths; public sphere; counterpublics;
   identity; arts
AB This article addresses European Muslims' public engagement in the arts by applying the concept of counterpublics. It examines two case studies of young German Muslims whose involvement in the public sphere can be described as soft counterpublics. The term soft counterpublics denotes publics that show some characteristics of counterpublics, but are at the same time not only about 'countering'. They can be seen as 'in between' cases, neither strong counterpublics nor completely beyond counterpublics. Their art reflects a diversity of interests that are translated into public expressions and related back to their multiple identities. Motivations and themes are multi-layered. Occasionally, topics address stereotypes and negative identity representations of Muslims, which reflect important characteristics of counterpublics. However, themes can deal with a broad range of matters that go beyond this particular issue and that can be seen in isolation of counterpublics. On the one hand, there is a natural interest in the arts as a tool to express oneself, which is not a typical case of counterpublics. On the other hand, there is also the intention to speak to people through the arts. As well as wanting to reach the Muslim youth community in Germany, who can identify with their art, the case studies are also concerned about the non-Muslim German community and its perception of Muslim identity in Germany.

AB Adding to the debate on the integrative or marginalizing nature of female part-time work, this article provides a comparative analysis of the implications of female part-time work for different intrinsic job quality dimensions and job satisfaction. Drawing on national micro-data from Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden, our multivariate analyses show cross-national similarities in terms of lower job learning opportunities for female part-timers. We found a significantly higher incidence of repetitiveness only among Swedish female part-timers and lower degrees of task discretion among British, Dutch, and Swedish women working part-time hours. Female part-timers were either equally satisfied with their work as female full-timers or even more satisfied. This held true also after accounting for the lower intrinsic job quality of part-time work. While women working part-time hours were as affected by their job quality characteristics as were full-timers, we conclude that the shorter hours of work per se provide an important additional source of job satisfaction.

TI The social investment approach as a field of job creation. From the
   'recalibration' to a resurgent trade-off between employment growth and
   low wage (white) jobs. A comparison between Germany and Italy

AB The social investment approach emerged as a new welfare paradigm, aimed at reconciling the traditional functions of the welfare supply with a productive social agenda, designed at preparing people to confront the 'new social risks', whether they be related to the problem of balancing paid work and family responsibilities, upgrading the skills, preventing inequalities and promoting the availability of in-kind services. In order to achieve these objectives, especially those related to care needs and work-life balance, the adoption of social investment-based strategies necessarily implies an expansion of the jobs related to health and social care services. In more recent years, many studies have analysed the limitations of the social investment policies because of their different redistributive impacts on social groups. Several studies have found a higher use of these policies for high-income families. Another source of criticism on social investment is that spending on these policies would seem to crowd out more traditional passive social expenditures. In this article, we examine another question related to the widespread of this approach: what are the effects of the social investment policies in terms of direct job creation? In fact, one of the more controversial issues, related to social investment policies, is their direct contribution to the labour market in terms of both quantity and quality of work within welfare services. The article analyses these issues focusing on Germany and Italy, two countries that represent not only two different care regimes but also two distinct models regarding job creation strategies in the care sector. In doing so, particular attention will be paid to long-term care policies, as they represent one of the pivotal areas of the social investment approach, both in terms of social services, to address new social risks, and new jobs related to welfare services
