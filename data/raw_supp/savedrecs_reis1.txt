AB Public policy is clearly committed to supporting research as a driving force in regional development. However, few studies have yet to analyze the relationship between governance and performance of research group networks. An analysis of 11 multidisciplinary research networks containing 83 research groups revealed that governance does in fact influence network performance. Specifically, high-performance networks are characterized by relationships having strong ties, formalized structures and powerful groups with low centrality. These findings suggest the need to improve network consolidation and to better define decision-making bodies in order to ensure proper collective operation.

DT Article
DE Social Change; Causes of Death; Life Expectancy; Longevity; Mortality

AB This paper describes and explains the recent trends in life expectancy at birth in Spain from an interdisciplinary perspective. It is based on two methods: segmented linear regression, and decomposition of life expectancy. The study consists of three sections. First, a description is provided of the demographic factors that explain the increase in the life expectancy at birth of the Spanish population from 1910 to 2009, which is in excess of 40 years. Second, the effect that changes in mortality have had on life expectancy at birth during 1980-2009 is analysed by cause of death of the population aged 65 and above. And third, the social and epidemiological causes underlying that increase are described. It is concluded that the increase of life expectancy at birth in Spain is mainly due to the reduction of mortality at advanced ages and a decrease in cardiovascular mortality.

LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Latin Gang; Social Capital; Coro; Stigma; Nation; Symptom
AB This article explores the criminalized social imaginaries of so-called Latin gangs in Spain, dismantling stereotypes and proposing different analysis approaches. The empirical material comes from an ethnography conducted between 2010 and 2011 in neighborhoods in the suburbs of Barcelona. The main techniques used were document analysis, participant observation with various youth immigrant groups and collection of data from oral sources with diferents types of informants. The results of the study discuss the social image of these groups, which stigmatize young people that are involved in them and it is symptom of segregated reception of immigration, increasingly in times of economic crisis. We analyze the dynamics of violence concerning these groups; at the same time, we interprete these groups as circulation spaces of social capital and as forms of agency, that can empower the members individually and collectively.

AB The economic crisis has placed the corporatist framework in Spain under significant strain. Labour unrest has also intensified, shifting to the political arena and threatening to overwhelm existing institutional channels. This article evaluates the tendencies toward consensus and conflict in democratic Spain, examining the theoretical debate on the competitive reorientation of national models of corporatism in Southern Europe within the context of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). In addition, it examines the symptoms of erosion in the Spanish corporatist experience within a scenario of economic crisis. The article emphasizes the underlying continuity in the political exchange between government and social partners and concludes that, despite the deterioration of social dialogue, the mechanisms for the production of social pacts in Spain have not completely fractured, and there are possibilities for their reactivation.

AB This article addresses the relationship between population and housing in Spain by using an interpretative approach based on demographic techniques. The main aims are to ascertain the rapid recent development in the Spanish housing system, and to explore how it will fare in the near future. To do so, some arguments are presented for the need to analyse housing systems from a comparative perspective. The situation in Spain in the international context is analysed, and the dynamics and change in the Spanish housing system are dealt with empirically. The empirical analysis highlights that it is important to take into account temporal dimensions, particularly age. It is confirmed that a new stage of extremely low demand for main residences is currently emerging, which may be aggravated by the current economic crisis and its effects on family formation. In addition, rental is identified as an option for enabling young people to have access to housing, and thus home ownership is questioned as the prevailing feature of the Spanish housing system in the future.

DE Visual Anthropology; Social Determination of Meaning; Photography;
   Family Research; Rural to Urban Migration; Social Tensions
AB Before the rural exodus of the 1950s in Italy, a symbolic and reverse exodus took place. The symbolic capital of modern culture penetrated into the farming world. Society has particular mechanisms in place to relieve pressures, thereby also announcing and preparing for social changes. This paper analyses one of these mechanisms, namely family photography between the late 19th century and the early 20th century. Through some singular portraits, we see the 'dispatcher' role that photography played in the interstices of society between psychological, social, and material realities: a junction of emotions, a mediator between the rural and urban worlds, a rite of passage that channels drives, and a yardstick of what society considers to be correct or not.

AB This paper presents research findings that focus on analyzing the conditions that enable and/or complicate the development of the critical intercultural approach in Pre-schools and Primary schools. To this end, three case studies were conducted in schools in the Spanish Autonomous Region of Andalusia. The main data production techniques used were: participatory observation, interviews and documentary analysis. The results are organized around three dimensions of analysis: the concept of inequality and/or diversity as a driving force for change in schools and the opening-up of the school setting as a challenge/reproduction of cultural homogeneity and hegemony. The findings show how the dynamics and interactions that exist within these schools provide opportunities but also create limitations when it comes to shaping new intercultural realities.

We present the results of a study examining methodological documents and questionnaires used for data collection for the Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) and the Household Budget Survey (HBS), the two principal Spanish surveys on domestic economics. Analyses revealed the theoretical and methodological biases underlying the design of these two surveys, as well as data gaps and limitations occurring in their design and in the statistical analyses carried out based on their data.

AB Spanish religious indicators have experienced one of the most drastic declines in Europe. The low levels of church attendance and religious denomination contributed to reject the perception of religiosity as a relevant explanatory factor of electoral behavior. However, leaders continued introducing debated related to secular education, divorce and abortion not only during the eighties, but also more recently from 2004 to 2011. The facts encourage us to reconsider the strength of the religious vote. Is the political elite able to mobilize religious voting through the inclusion of such issues in the electoral debate? In this paper I demonstrate that religiosity has been and still is a key element to understand Spanish electoral behavior, especially in those elections in which the political elite has focused the debate on issues related to moral issues.

AB Andalusian Southeast has passed between 1960 and 2010 from traditional-subsistence farming to a modern greenhouse agriculture, increasingly innovative, professionalized and disconnected from the household. This article intends to identify and classify social values internalized by family farmers in their socio-labor trajectories. Therefore, the article focuses on the autobiographical narratives of farmers, which have been obtained through participant observation and biographical interviews with them. In parallel to the profound changes in the socioeconomic practices of family farmers, their social values related to such practices have undergone successive variations. These are considered here as active strategies by those farmers aimed to redefining their views and perceptions of the reality they live, more and more affected by globalization's uncertainties.

   Gender Gap in Knowledge
SO REVISTA ESPANOLA DE INVESTIGACIONES SOCIOLOGICAS

DT Article
DE Political Knowledge; Gender Gap; Surveys; Measurement; Validity
ID DONT KNOW; WOMEN
AB How much do Spanish citizens know about politics? Is political knowledge unequally distributed among the Spanish population? While levels of political knowledge in Spain are low, there are also important socioeconomic and gender differences in levels of knowledge. Knowledge is higher among those with higher levels of education, greater socioeconomic and cognitive resources and, in particular, among men. These differences are explained as a function of citizens' resources, capacities, and motivation. However this study also shows that part of the gender gap in political knowledge in Spain is due to the way in which surveys measure that knowledge, which reveals important problems of validity. The results suggest the importance of testing new ways of asking survey questions about citizens' political knowledge, as studies in other countries have shown.

AB The cause of the big cities concentration of artists has been gaining centrality in academic research as it has been underlined its importance for the creative industries. The research of this phenomenon is usually based on economic clustering theories, which only take into account infrastructural factors of the location. Although this approach has been increasingly criticized and social interactions have been considered more important, the contributions of sociology of artistic professions or urban sociology have been mostly ignored. Taking into account the results of these sociological perspectives a the research proposes a more multidimensional and a more critical point of view towards the agglomeration artistic phenomenon, considering it as a functional phenomenon of postfordist economy.

DE Social Action; Social Constructivism; Economic Crises; Rational Choice;

AB This paper is proposed as a critical approach to normativism and rational-action based sociological models, starting from the idea that they overrate the capacities of agents to understand and evaluate the mechanisms of social life. In opposition to these theoretical approaches, we suggest that contingency and failure (not taken into account by these approaches) appear as constant realities, inevitable and appropriate for understanding social action. In this journey we rely on Ramos' proposal on the tragic dimension of action, in addition to the reformulation by Arendt of Heidegger's concept of care. Finally, we critique the role assigned to certain experts in the current scenario of economic crisis, from presumption of the ability to predict and correct social paths, pushing for success as a goal.

AB This article reviews in a systematic way the research of the evolution of Inequality of Educational Opportunities (IEO) in Spain undertaken to date. To accomplish this objective, Spanish studies are compared to international ones, both in methodological and substantive terms. Three characteristics have been observed in the existing research of the Spanish case: 1) methodological heterogeneity; 2) lack of agreement about the evolution of IEO, even with the same data; 3) deficit of theoretical and analytical explanations of tendencies. Finally, this article calls for more research of IEO in Spain that, on the one hand, is linked with international debates and, on the other hand, aims not only at describing tendencies but also at explaining them.

AB This paper estimates public and private (household) spending per student on education in early childhood, primary and secondary education in Spain, in public educational institutions and in publicly-funded private educational institutions. We use 2007 data from the Household Spending on Education Survey and the Statistics on Public Spending on Education. Public expenditure on education per student in publicly-funded private educational institutions was 49.9% that spent on public educational institutions. The cost assumed by families in public institutions was 38.7% that spent on publicly-funded private educational institutions. The total expenditure per student on publicly-funded private educational institutions was 66.9% that spent on public educational institutions. Enrollment in publicly-funded private educational institutions implies a reduction of public expenditure on education and the transfer of part of those educational expenses to families.

AB This paper explores the impact of school performance (primary effects) and the structure of costs and benefits that individuals of different social class face (secondary effects) on the transition from compulsory to non-compulsory education in Spain. We find that both predictors of educational paths seem to operate through an interactive effect, which contributes to reproducing educational inequalities. This interaction suggests that school performance is not interpreted in the same way by individuals from different social classes. In concrete, the resources and social capital of upper class families provide compensation effects leading to a greater probability of students from upper classes with poor grades reaching post-compulsory secondary education and higher education in comparison to lower class students with the equivalent grades. Therefore, inequality by social class of origin is greatest among students with the lowest grades.

DE Cluster; Higher Education; Employability; Scale; Graduates
ID WORK
AB The purpose of this paper is to develop a scale for measuring the commitment of Spanish universities to the employability of their graduates by looking at four different dimensions of the term: basic, business protocol, matching and feedback. These dimensions have been measured against initiatives that are run beyond the scope of official academic training. Based on this scale and applying the analysis of several clusters, we identify three profiles for university centers according to their commitment to the employability of their graduates. We gave a questionnaire to 230 higher education institutions in Spain. The results demonstrated that Spanish universities have a long way to go to reach sufficient commitment in the four areas proposed. Only one third of the centers analyzed met the criteria. Last, we propose some potential measures for improvement such as requiring a minimum level of a foreign language in order to complete a degree, the use of interactive learning methodologies and collaboration with employers.

AB Most analysts agree that in the Basque Country, the nationalism cleavage is more important for political party competition than the left-right divide. Recent studies, however, suggest that self-placement on the left-right scale is a better predictor of electoral behaviour than self-placement on a nationalism scale. We have attempted to solve this seeming paradox by showing that self-placement along the left-right axis is related to preferences regarding many different areas, and is therefore not necessarily coincident with the classic understanding of "left" and "right". Once the preferences regarding certain issues were operationalised, the Basque nationalism-Spanish nationalism divide was found to be a more important factor for electoral decisions than the left-right divide.

DE Differential Abstention; Ecological Analysis; Catalonia; Madrid;

AB Differences in turnout between general and regional elections in Spain reveal two recurrent characteristics: they are highest in the regions of Catalonia and Madrid and tend to be concentrated in the metropolitan areas of the cities of Barcelona and Madrid. What explains these two regional patterns? To explain this phenomenon, this article contributes new elements, using census data at the tract level. The main conclusion is that the demobilization observed in regional elections is related to certain characteristics of the socio-demographic structure of the metropolitan areas in these two regions: a higher presence of young voters, higher unemployment and a higher percentage of the electorate born outside their region of residence. In addition, a political factor, support for the socialist party, also appears to be an important element in explaining this differential abstention. The combination of all these factors provides a clearer picture of those who abstain in regional elections as well as new clues to understand the phenomenon of differential abstention.

AB The present paper analyses and revises the latest Democracy Index published by the Economist Intelligence Unit in the United Kingdom. We analyze the changes produced in the index from 2006 to 2011, as well as in the five basic factors that constitute the index: electoral process and pluralism; civil liberties; the functioning of government; political participation; and political culture. The analysis of these factors -measured by sixty variables-has made it possible to develop a new index, based on the data from 167 countries, and calculate a revised ranking. Countries have been classified into four types: democracies, flawed democracies, mixed systems, and authoritarian/totalitarian regimes. The new index permits a better understanding of the impact of the crisis through variables such as economic growth, human development, quality of life, corruption, and violence.

AB Political representation is one of the primary areas of academic debate, from both theoretical and empirical perspectives; that is, the conditions necessary for its existence and how to assess it. This article presents a comparative analysis of party-voter congruence on two dimensions: ideology and European integration. Using data from the EES 2009 survey, two indicators, proximity and centrism are applied to a large sample of European political parties. In the second part of the article, the effect of partisan characteristics on party-voter congruence is examined. Results of statistical analyses demonstrate that right-wing parties and those that are more Euro-optimistic tend to generate a stronger connection with their electorates. Similarly, party size, age and membership in certain party families are shown to have relevance in explaining parties-voter linkages.

AB Research into risk perception has been typically focused on the study of social conflicts motivated by potentially dangerous technologies and events. However, in this article an attempt is made to understand why, in certain cases, the population exposed to an obvious risk are not actively mobilised and do not protest against it. Based on a case study in the petrochemical area of Tarragona, the population's perception and practices in connection with risk are analysed by using data from a series of focus groups (8) and a questionnaire survey (N = 400). The results allow us to disregard unawareness of risk as a reason, and to assess the importance of the perceived benefits from exposure to risk, as well as to understand the fundamental role of trust and dependency that are embedded in a social and institutional context characterised by a marked asymmetry in power relations.

AB Despite evidences of the media's influence on shaping the attitudes of the Spanish population towards the immigrant community, survey indicators have seldom been designed to explain the relationship between media coverage of immigrants and the attitudes of native towards this phenomenon. Using a sample of students, we examined the validity of different types of indicators used to measure the frequency of media consumption, the recall of news regarding immigration and the degree of media credibility in order to explain racist and xenophobic attitudes. Results reveal a clear association between the news media and native group attitudes towards immigration, thus demonstrating the usefulness of these indicators.

TI Michael Oakeshott's Work as a Liberal-Conservative Paradigm
SO REVISTA ESPANOLA DE INVESTIGACIONES SOCIOLOGICAS
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Political Theory; Liberalism; Conservatism; Traditions; Moral Values
AB As is the case with other thinkers linked to what can be broadly defined as conservatism, it is arguable whether Michael Oakeshott was just a conservative, or whether he was also a liberal. He often rejected this last label. He also tried to avoid the classic debate between the left/right wing divide, conferring instead a mantle of neutrality on his work. This analysis shows, on the one hand, that Oakeshott's work is ideologically orientated and, on the other hand, that it contains a substantial liberal component. In fact, he offered a liberal-conservative synthesis in which the free market appears to be not only the best, but the only feasible outcome in the proposed scenario of political prudence. I will first connect Oakeshott with the main traditions of thought, then analyse the theoretical implications of his position, and finally explore the consequences derived from all this for everyday political practice.

AB The aim of this study is to identify the situations preceding the incorrect selection of survey respondents in Spain and their consequences, focusing on research in which survey respondents were selected through random routes and quotas. The use of the first six Barometer Surveys by the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research (CIS) in 2011 reveals a steady increase in the number of incidents. However, these do not involve any major differences with respect to the population as a whole in terms of gender, age, educational level and occupational status. The paper shows that cooperation patterns differ depending on the time of day and the day of the week when field work is performed. It also reveals that the level of accessibility varies significantly depending on the different traits of the respondents.

AB This article tackles the problem of tax evasion from a sociological view. The rational action approach is integrated here with the concepts of trust and tax morale. The aim is to discover why people justify fiscal fraud or have lax tax morale. The main hypothesis maintained here is that tax system social factors -such as trust- have an effect on the justification of fraud. Using two survey datasets referred to the past ten years, we observe that tax morale seems to be mainly composed by trust in tax system, trust in other taxpayers as well as diverse contextual factors. Finally, I present an interpretive framework that takes into consideration individual factors as well as social and geographic dimensions of tax evasion in Spain.

AB The commercialization of in-home care services and the incorporation of economic assistance following the implementation of the "Law on the Promotion of Personal Autonomy and Care of Dependent People" (LAPAD) are the most significant changes occurring in the social organization of senior care over the past decade. Given the internal diversity of the Spanish social services system-- subsidies offered for care and privatization, this study explores the various social organization models of family care in the Autonomous Communities, examining regional differences. Correspondence analysis was used to create a national classification system based on public and private family care in the different regions.

AB This paper provides an approach to the aesthetic canon of Spanish pop-rock, which is understood as being the musicians, bands and works which have had the most influence on this musical genre in Spain. Using Bourdieu's sociology of art and its application to popular music studies, surveys have been analysed that were carried out by both Spanish music critics and musicians. The hypothesis posed is whether an autochthonous aesthetic canon exists, and whether this is determined by an Anglo-American influence. From lists or rankings published whether in books or in general or specialist magazines, these data were combined to obtain a meta-ranking, which was tested by using certain statistical tests. From this, some characteristics particular to the Spanish aesthetic canon have been obtained, as well as some which are shared with the English-speaking canon.

AB The effectiveness of the measures taken from the prison system for the reintegration of inmates is a recurring debate in criminology. In this article, we analyze the extent to which occupational training and work programs in prisons contribute to social and professional reintegration of inmates and ex-inmates. The starting point is a research carried out in Catalonia through in-depth interviews with experts, inmates and ex-inmates. The main findings are: a) the occupational training and work programs contribute to the reintegration of prisoners moderately, according to their personal motivation and social resources; b) however, these programs would be decisive in therapeutic and educational aspects with regard to maintaining order and, indirectly, to the social rehabilitation of prisoners.

AB The main goal of this article is to assess the influence of the individualisation process on working-class family relationships. This is a relevant analysis, bearing in mind the importance of the family in welfare provision in Spain and the transformative capacity that the. individualisation process has had for the conception and management of family bonds; however, the main theoretical work which has dealt with this process to date has failed to address the working class. The in-depth interviews conducted with workers from the textile and clothing industry of the Valencian regions of l'Alcoia, Comtat and Vall d'Albaida led to the conclusion that their concept of family and care responsibilities has been influenced by individualisation, prioritizing individual satisfaction over social rules and conventions. However; their practices still continue to reflect very traditional patterns, largely due to their fragile position in the social structure.

AB Focusing on the 2000, 2008 and 2011 Spanish elections, this paper provides three contributions to the literature on electoral competition from a Downsian perspective. Firstly, an answer is offered to the three paradoxes that arise when applying the basic proximity vote model to electoral competition in Spain. Secondly, a more solid theoretical and empirical grounding is provided for the existing proposals to integrate non-positional issues into the Downsian model. Finally, a type of logistic regression is employed which is more appropriate for understanding the behaviour of the median voter, whose role is crucial in Spanish election results. Our findings have important implications in understanding the workings of one of the most commonly used models in political science.

AB The increasing demand for highly qualified workers in developed countries has raised a new interest in analysing whether doctoral training meets the needs of the European labour market. Job satisfaction enables an approach to both the relationship between training and job position and to a company's successful management of its relationship with those workers who are PhD holders. The results indicate that an analysis based on earnings is relevant, as it makes it possible to identify two clear job satisfaction behaviours: on the one hand, as earnings increase, so does job satisfaction, although this is found to a lesser extent in the higher earnings range; on the other hand, when moving up in the salary range, the relative assessment of job satisfaction components changes, as well as their significance in explaining the variations in job satisfaction.

AB Epidemiological perspectives applied to the study of socioeconomic inequalities in health are characterized by a one-dimensional approach to social differences, as income, occupation, and education are used as interchangeable variables to capture social inequalities. This paper calls into question this assumption by exploring the impact of parent's education and occupation on their newborns' health status, using the low birth weight indicator. We show that occupation and education, although related, should not be used as interchangeable. This study also challenges the traditional perspective in epidemiology of studying perinatal outcomes focusing exclusively on mother's information, as it shows that, despite the slightly higher influence of the mother's socioeconomic information, both parents have a key role on their newborn's birthweight.

AB This paper analyses media coverage of corruption scandals in Spain between 1996 and 2009. The first aim is to determine to what extent the two most-read newspapers in Spain, El Pais and El Mundo, cover corruption scandals following different political orientations. Results illustrate highly partisan media coverage: there are important differences in how these newspapers cover corruption cases, depending on the political party involved (PP or PSOE). A second goal is to analyse whether the media influence citizens' perception of corruption as a public problem. Results show that, when the number of news stories on political corruption increases, the percentage of citizens that consider corruption as one of the most important problems in Spain also increases. Media impact on public opinion is high and occurs in the short-to mid-term. Finally, the paper analyses to what extent the perception of corruption is influenced by changes in the perception of the economic situation, by showing that this variable has low explanatory power compared to media coverage.

AB The aim of this paper is to understand how the concept of 'career' can be applied to a specific chronic disease such as multiple sclerosis. This research is focused on 'careers' as the term is used in Symbolic Interactionism in Sociology. The qualitative research is based on thirty semi-directed interviews, four group interviews with people suffering from multiple sclerosis in French hospitals and associations, and twenty-three observations made over a one-year period. Three stages in the 'careers' of the subjects showed the onset of the disease: the start of the symptoms, the announcement of the diagnosis, which confirms the entry into the disease (and defined life before and after the disease), and the preparation of the 'biographical work'. Depending on how one lives and enters into the 'careers' of the disease, such 'careers' will be more or less complex and different, as will also be the forms of biographical paths.

AB This article analyses the development of single-person living arrangements amongst unmarried people aged between 65 and 84 years old who did not live with a partner between 1991 and 2001 in seven European countries (Spain, France, Greece, Hungary, Portugal, Romania and Switzerland). To do so, census micro data provided by IPUMS (Integrated Public Use Microdata Series) were used. The role of five variables with regard to the probability of living alone versus living with others was examined. It was investigated whether the observed development was due to changes in the population composition. Logistic regression was used as a standardisation technique with the census data. Results showed that, after controlling for all the variables, the observed regional patterns remain the same, and that the proportion of elderly living alone increased in 2001 in all countries but Romania where, if the population composition had not changed, this proportion would have diminished. The demographic structure (by gender, age and marital status) did not significantly modify the observed proportions either over time or at a regional level. In contrast, the variations of the structure regarding the socio-economic variables (educational level and employment status) were key to explain part of the observed change.

AB Literature regarding immigrant economic integration tends to highlight a U-shaped economic mobility pattern. Our article challenges this argument based on labor market segmentation theories and an occupational mobility analysis made from a "class structure" perspective. Data from the 2007 National Immigrant Survey in Spain was used to create mobility tables indicating immigrant occupational mobility fluidity from their last employment in their country of origin to their first employment in Spain (n=7,280), and from their first employment in Spain to their current employment (n=4,031), estimating odds ratios in order to examine the relative mobility. Two labor market segments were identified as having frequent occupational mobility within them and limited mobility outside of them. Our analysis suggests the existence of a segmented U-shaped pattern of immigrant occupational mobility.

AB This paper pretends to demonstrate the complementary relations between three relatively recent sociological theories, each one of which explains a different aspect of the same social object: the origin, diffusion and change of social and cultural values, aiming at demonstrating that there is not such a thing as a sociological theory that explains all, but rather diverse theories that offer partial explanations of social reality. To that effect, and on the basis of the necessary relationship between theory and research, three different theories are evaluated separately: Hawley's and Duncan's theory of the social ecosystem, Galtung's centre-periphery theory, and Inglehart's theory of values' change in modern-industrial societies, offering theoretical and empirical evidence of their complementary relations, based on Spanish and international data. Social ecosystem and centre-periphery theories show a high level of generalization (through space and time) and a high level of abstraction, though both can easily operationalize their main concepts through valid and reliable indicators. The theory of values' change, however, though showing a high level of generalization, is limited in time to the historical period after World War II, and also shows a high level of abstraction. Centre-periphery theory and values' change theory use individual and collective units of analysis, but social ecosystem theory only uses collective units, by definition. The three theories lead to the conclusion that 'security' values will gain a growing importance in present societies.

AB This paper analyses the predictions of the election results for the Spanish Parliament published in the main Spanish newspapers. To gauge their degree of accuracy, the distance between the predictions and the actual results was defined and later assessed by comparing it with that of the so-called 'perfect poll'. This 'perfect poll' was generated by a simulation using the proportions of votes actually obtained by each party. Other issues related to the published polls are also analysed, such as the relationship between sample size and estimation quality, and between the error made (by excess or defect) for a party and the ideological affinity between that party and the newspaper publishing the survey.

AB The literature on the phenomenon of abstention has shown that participation is determined by certain individual and contextual factors. However, the empirical studies conducted using rational choice theory have not taken these contributions into account. Some authors, more focused on understanding the factors that should be included in the voting equation, have concluded that citizens vote because they overestimate the value of their vote. But is this overestimation random? What does it depend on? The aim of this study, based on the 2008 post-election survey data of the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research (CIS), is to turn the traditional factors of the instrumental voter equation into dependent variables, thereby discovering some of their determinants. The results show that the distribution of these factors is not random and that it does not always match what was predicted.

DT Article
DE Childhood; Life-Stage Transition; Family Relations; Inter-generational
   Relations; Autonomy; Leisure; Collective Representations
AB The definition of the age range for childhood varies from one society to another, and has often been used as evidence that childhood is a social construction. The aim of this study is to analyse the collective representation of these age limits and their relationship with the concept of autonomy as constructed by public opinion in Spain. The latest available data about attitudes towards childhood from the Spanish Sociological Research Centre (CIS) were used, as well as CIS study 2621 on opinions, and attitudes to Childhood. Factorial analysis revealed a series of components that we have called "autonomy factors". The main conclusion is that public opinion understands childhood from an adult-centric perspective as a complex sequence that includes different temporal boundaries, ranging from an early age, where autonomy appears as an expression of a private world under family authority; to others closer to the age of majority, which include participation in the institutional sphere and behaviour associated with youth leisure time.

AB Taking as an empirical basis some of the data from a questionnaire applied to a sample of approximately eight hundred parents from three public secondary schools, this paper discusses how various categories of parents organise "hierarchies of excellence" through the "arguments for choice" that they prioritise when choosing their children's school for entrance into secondary education (year 10 of schooling, equivalent to the year 4 of compulsory secondary education in Spain - ESO). The analysis of the data highlights that, in all segments of parents, a group can be found that attaches great importance to academic indicators; in addition, an unequal concentration of these groups was verified in the three establishments studied, which reflects a predominance of different types of public in each school. Thus, even though the importance attributed to the "arguments for choice" varies according to the educational level of the parents, in the cases studied the "hierarchies of excellence" are distinguished, above all, by the school variable.

AB The Spanish Institute for National Statistics (INE) has decided to create new Migration Statistics (Estadistica de Migraciones) based upon Residential Variation Statistics (Estadistica de Variaciones Residenciales). This article presents arguments to support this decision, in view of the continued lack of consistency found among the sources of the Spanish statistics system for measuring population mobility. Specifically, an insight is provided into the problems of underestimation and internal inconsistency in the Spanish Labour Force Survey when measuring immigration rates, based upon discrepancies identified in the three international immigration flow series produced by this survey.

AB This paper analyses the system of actors involved in the development of residential tourism on the north east coast of Brazil. The study observes the socio-political effects of the 2001-2008 real estate boom, focused on the promotion of second homes in closed residential areas. Stakeholder Analysis (SA) is used to identify the various actors' roles and positions within a particular social space in a tourist setting which is exposed to transnational and real estate interests. The method reveals an unequal and conflict-ridden social reality. The results show that residential tourism shapes the local socio-political configuration, strengthening some actors (urban developers, real estate companies) whilst positioning others in a situation of dependence (local communities, cities).

AB This paper attempts to research the minimum size which a moderate and tolerant group of individuals should have in order to lead an extremely intolerant and polarised social network to achieve political consensus. It also analyses the potential effect of different structural properties of networks (density and inequality of link distribution), and certain individual properties (tolerance and entrenchment of political opinions) on that minimum size. To do so, it combines agent-based modelling and social network analysis in order to carry out virtual experiments with artificial networks. The results reveal the existence of a minimum, critical size under which political consensus is hardly ever achieved, as well as showing that such size depends heavily on various structural and individual properties.

AB This paper examines the employment transitions of unemployed individuals who have worked before. To do so, a longitudinal data set from the Spanish Labour Force Survey (Encuesta de Poblacion Activa, EPA) was used. The analyses were conducted for two different economic periods: expansive (2005-2007) and recessive (2008-2010). The results indicate that Latin Americans and Eastern Europeans had a higher probability of obtaining employment in Spain during the period of economic growth. This was the case after controlling for socio-demographic variables, as well as factors related to the characteristics of the last job before becoming unemployed. This advantage, however, disappears during the recession period. Moreover, the effect of some factors that influence the likelihood of being employed again, such as human capital, change depending on the phase of the economic cycle.

AB This paper focuses on the social theory of freedom proposed by Norbert Elias, as opposed to classic philosophical views. Firstly, it analyses the basic features of the metaphysical theories of freedom which Elias rejects. Then the key points on which Norbert Elias's social theory of freedom is based are developed. Finally, two Eliasian classic empirical examples are briefly discussed: the cases of Louis XIV and Mozart. The above is intended to show that Elias has a legitimate voice in the current scientific debate about freedom, especially within Neuroscience.

TI Migration Revisited: the 2009 Human Development Report
SO REVISTA ESPANOLA DE INVESTIGACIONES SOCIOLOGICAS

DT Article
DE Growth; Development; Emigration; Urbanization
AB Since the 1970s, the link between migration and development has been identified as a major topic of political and scientific debate. As a sign of a renewed interest in the issue, in 2009 the United Nations Development Programme published its Human Development Report (HDR) with the title "Overcoming Barriers: mobility and human development". Some of the data in the HDR are reviewed in this paper in order to question certain cliches regarding the relationships between international migration flows and development processes. Our main conclusion is that the link between the two is not one-directional, nor does it follow generalisable patterns beyond the confirmation that the countries with medium human development are the most affected by migration, but also benefit the most from it.

TI Why do Women in Spain Retire Later than Men?
SO REVISTA ESPANOLA DE INVESTIGACIONES SOCIOLOGICAS
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Life Course; Gender Differences; Employment; Retirement; Pensions
ID EMPLOYMENT; GENDER; WORK
AB The relationship between gender and retirement in Spain is paradoxical. The female employment rate between the ages of 55 and 64 is slightly more than half that of the male rate, whilst the average retirement age amongst women is much higher. Using event-history analysis techniques, this paper analyses whether this puzzling gender difference is due to compositional or selection effects. Data comes from a special retirement module within the 2006 Spanish Labour Force Survey (Encuesta de Poblacion Activa, EPA). It applies a novel methodological framework, contrasting the results from a naive survival analysis with those from a duration-selection model. The results suggest that women retire later than men above all because, from a financial point of view, they cannot afford to retire any earlier.

DT Article
DE Activism; Associations; Women; Pluralism; Typology; Public Services
ID SERVICE; SPAIN
AB The main objective of this article is to analyse pluralism within the context of women's associations in Spanish cities. Specifically, a methodological proposal is made in order to develop a typology of women's associations. It is applied to data from a survey conducted in five cities in Spain. The main results confirm the pluralism within this type of associations. However, besides the two main types of women's associations identified by the literature (the feminist movement and women's associations), other hybrid types are identified here according to their role in the co-production of public services. Thus, co-production, as well as their own agendas, their political activism and the delivery of their own public services, appears as an important dimension in classifying women's associations and enhancing the knowledge about them in Spain.

AB This paper tests the equalization hypothesis at the vote level. A good number of studies have examined whether the Internet is levelling the playing field in electoral competition by offering fringe parties opportunities to increase their visibility. To test the influence of use of the Internet in vote choice, we analyze the behaviour of ERC voters. Using survey data, we test whether online exposure to political information affects vote choice among these voters. We find that online exposure to political information increases the probability of voting for Solidaritat Catalana relatively to voting again for ERC. The analysis provides empirical evidence to support the idea that the Internet works as a differentiated media environment in which political messages compete in more equal terms.

AB This article analyses the impact of the policies implemented by five Autonomous Communities -Navarre, Castile and Leon, the Basque Country, Castile-La Mancha and La Rioja- on parental leave use. The research adopts a quasi-experimental design, which is known in public policy evaluation as difference-in-difference. The analysis is based on a subsample which stems from the "Muestra Continua de Vidas Laborales" (wave 2006), and is comprised of 94,493 people who were entitled to parental leave in the 1996-2006 period. The results show a positive effect of Navarre and Castile and Leon's policies and confirm the relevance of benefit levels versus other design characteristics. However, none of these policies have an effect on men's use of parental leave, even in the case of those Autonomous Communities that have implemented positive discrimination measures.

AB In this article the relationship between the distribution of values among the citizens of European countries, and the institutional arrangements of the social protection schemes of these countries is analysed, as conceptualised by the most common typologies of Welfare Regimes. After analysing the distribution of values in Europe, and measuring their impact on attitudes towards welfare across different Welfare Regimes, it was observed that those values are not distributed following the boundaries of the basic typology of these Regimes. The study of favourable attitudes towards the intervention of the State in the domain of social protection through a multi-level regression analysis shows, however, that there are specific characteristics in the support to those Regimes in each country. This creates an aggregation of values which is specific to each of those Regimes.

AB This paper analyses whether the fear of indebtedness resulting from going on to post-secondary education affects potential students' decisions to apply for, and enter into, Higher Education; whether there is any relationship between the fear of indebtedness and the socio-economic level of the families of potential students; and whether there is an association between the fear of indebtedness and student performance. This study shows that the fear of indebtedness for post-secondary studies is not a limiting factor for young people from lower-income sectors to go on to tertiary education. The study also shows that availability of loans facilitates access to Higher Education. These findings contradict the conclusions of studies by Claire Callender and Jonathan Jackson, who previously analysed the British case with the same aims.

DE Gender Inequality; Flexibility; Working Hours; Labor Market; Time
   Utilization
AB The aim of this article is to analyze the inequalities between men and women at the Spanish labour market from a particular gender perspective. We start from the premise that these inequalities can only be understood and explained if they are analysed considering their connection with the inequalities that take place in the context of the gender domestic relations. We consider that these inequalities are the result of the conjunction of the dynamics of the "new capitalism" enterprises, which is characterized for demanding the maximum availability from the employees, and the asymmetrical gender relations, which invade the whole social order and are particularly active within the domestic sphere. From a methodological point of view this connection is argued using the temporal dimension, on the basis of the analysis of the Time Use Survey which has been carried out by the Spanish National Statistics Institute in 2009-2010.

AB In a previous paper we explained the socio-economic context in which clinical trials are implemented and evaluated, and in which their results are published, whilst showing some of their methodological limitations. In this study, after showing two different models of evaluation (methodological and cognitive), we analyse the controversial evaluation of three drugs: two of them having been evaluated by clinical trial and the third one not, in spite of the willingness of the drug manufacturer to undertake this type of evaluation. As a result of this research, further findings were made with regard to the considerable influence that the socio-economic component of clinical trial evaluation has, as opposed to that of the technical, on deciding whether a new drug should or should not pass the evaluation, even though it is the technical/scientific component that is supposed to prevail. From a methodological perspective, this conclusion leads to question the methodological model of evaluation, and to think, however tentatively, of an alternative, namely, the cognitive model of evaluation.

AB The aim of this work is to analyze the response rates of a multi modality survey on sports behaviour and habits in a borough of Madrid. The development of response rates in both face-to-face and telephone surveys is shown, considering some of the main factors which can have an influence on the differences found. The results indicate that observed variations in nonresponse rates depend on the survey mode employed and also show that the telephone survey works better compared to the face-to-face survey.

ID SYSTEMS; DECENTRALIZATION; DEMOCRACIES
AB This study is focused on the nationalization of political parties in Spain understood as the homogeneity of parties' electoral support across constituencies in a national election. The first part of the paper describes the evolution of nationalization from 1977 to the present and shows how the Spanish party system is increasingly nationalized despite the differences across parties. The second part seeks to explain party nationalization determinants. The analysis indicates that the votes received at national level increases party nationalization. The age of the party enhances national parties' nationalization while in subnational parties this variable has a negative effect, pointing to a trade-off between the two groups. Finally, the ideological distance in the left-right axis reduces national parties' homogeneity across districts while founding elections have no effect.

AB This article examines the historical background of Czech Euroscepticisnn, an issue rarely explored as yet. The theoretical framework examines the relationship between national identity and the Other. In this respect, identity is constructed through successive identifications - both symbolic and imaginary - with significant Others. Identifications can be positive or negative. In order to classify such identifications towards the EU, qualitatively speaking, four basic criteria are proposed: "democracy", "economics", "security" and "national identity" Various speeches by President Vaclav Klaus serve as the sources along with the electoral programmes of ODS and KSCM. One of the conclusions suggests that the negative identifications toward the EU, particularly on the part of Klaus, are associated with memories of traumatic relationships with previous powers, such as the USSR, Germany or the Habsburg Empire.

AB This paper analyzes the different ways in which domestics and their employers dispute the limits of a labour and affective relationship. Different studies (Brites, 2001; Kofes, 2001; Rollins, 1985) have pointed out that this labour relationship is constituted in the ambiguity of the boundaries between these women, a relationship built on the social inequality between them. Our aim is to analyze the relationship between employers and employees, considering the different ways in which they establish the limits of their labour relationship, and focusing on what we call demarcation repertoires. The methodological techniques consisted of in-depth interviews with both employers and employees, observations and discourses gathered from situations that unfold outside the fieldwork.

DT Article
DE Religious Conversion; Islam; Muslims; Cultural Identity; Sex Role
   Identity; Feminism
ID CONVERSION
AB This article analyses the capacity for re-articulation and redefinition of identity developed by women converted to Islam. The adoption of a theoretical perspective committed to current feminisms allows us to go beyond the conceptual limits of other studies on conversion. These studies, following the functionalist tradition, focus the analysis on a generic "object" woman of academic construction, relegating their subjectively developed interpretative capacities to a mere epiphenomenon. However, focusing on some "subject" women converted to Islam,allows us to describe the performativity and originality deployed in the construction of their new religious identities. The conversion is thereby a complex, multiple and continuous process which implies a gradual construction of meaning in a sociocultural context, pertaining to Europe, where a particular view of what it means to be a Muslim woman does not yet exist.

AB Research on value change and stability tends to underline the importance of generational effects, Inglehart's theory of post-materialism being an example of this. According to his theory, formative experiences shape the values of each age-cohort, and social change takes place progressively due to the force of generational replacement. This article analyzes survey data covering a wider period of observations than the one Inglehart used to draw his conclusions. By applying time series techniques, I find significant changes within each generation over time.
   I show how an important adult learning process in the field of post-materialist values has taken place, which has been neglected by the empirical literature. Contrary to Inglehart's point of view, I conclude that period effects are not just minor short-term influences affecting the "normal" change due to generational replacement, but a systematic intracohort trend linked to the European economic prosperity of recent decades.

AB The aim of this paper is threefold: 1) to compare the impact of the Normalisation of 2005 with the new Settlement Programme established in 2006; 2) to analyse the trajectories of applicants from both programmes after their regularisation; 3) to examine the regularisation of applicants who were unable to qualify in their first attempt via the Normalisation or, subsequently, through the Settlement Programme. Two approaches have been implemented: one cross-sectional, to analyse the volume and intensity of entry, and the other longitudinal, to monitor the trajectories of applicants from both programmes. Specific data from 2005 to 2010 from the Government Representation Office in the Province of Barcelona have been used. Whilst the results shed some optimism on both programmes, they also demonstrate the difficulty of regularisation in times of economic crisis.

AB The article discusses the process of understanding the mobility of Romanian citizens in Spain. The analysis proposes three levels of analysis in order to find answers to three research questions: how the immigrants negotiate their mobility; what their experiences of mobility are; and how they understand this process. This study was carried out using the qualitative method of in-depth interviews, which were conducted both at origin and at destination. The analysis is organized into three levels: negotiation is linked to practical considerations; mobility experiences are accompanied by partial return; and understanding of the migration process is reflected in the sense of flexible identity. The levels of analysis interact and help find ways to assimilate mobility and the creation of the mobile citizen in the European framework.

AB In recent years, growing evidence has shown that welfare policies tend to favour the collective interests of elderly people at the expense of the new needs of groups that are entering adulthood. Studies conducted in several countries have found a growing gap between social spending amounts devoted to both groups. However, there has been considerably less research on the political processes leading to these outcomes. In this article we draw on the Spanish case to analyze how the dynamics of political agenda setting remains unresponsive to the interests and demands of young groups. We examine how cognitive maps, electoral incentives and political entrepreneurship impinged on. decision-making processes during the first four mandates of the socialist party (1982-1996).

AB Social studies on disability have increased in number and importance in Spain and other countries over the last few years. Nevertheless, the majority of the available sources and studies do not adequately represent this heterogeneous group, which currently makes up about 9 per cent of the Spanish population. The implementation of social measures requires representative sources and studies containing relevant information. The aim of this paper is to identify the main difficulties involved in designing and developing social research methods concerning persons with disabilities, and offer proposals and recommendations in order to advance towards a more inclusive social research using the concepts of accessibility and design for all.

AB This article analyzes the market mechanisms and institutional constraints that shape the evaluation and social spread of Spanish in El Paso, Texas, USA (located on the US-Mexico border). The results are presented through an analysis of labor sectors that have different main characteristics in the linguistic intensity of work and product. Based on in-depth interviews, the study finds that linguistic management policies in low-skilled sectors are effectively "Spanish-only". However, as skills increase and there is a greater need for formal Spanish in the occupational role, we observe more constraints on how Spanish functions in work use. In sectors where demand for Spanish language skills has grown, such as call centers, linguistic management is based on acculturated heritage Spanish as a means to obtain cheap labor.

ID CONSUMPTION
AB Food consumption has shown traits of convergence in the early stages of post-industrial development in modern societies. In this work we consider the current situation in relation to two fundamental aspects of dietary change: whether the evolution of food expenditure tends towards homogenization and whether or not the factors associated with food consumption are the same in different environments. For this reason we have chosen two countries that account for the diversity of factors that explain this change: UK and Spain. Comparative analysis of food expenditure in the UK and Spain has been carried out on the basis of household budget surveys and by applying multivariate analysis techniques. The results point to a progressive homogenization of expenditure, although there remains a significant heterogeneity or internal inequality in food consumption among the population due to economic, social and cultural factors, with differences between countries.

ID PUBLIC-ATTITUDES; CITIZENS; SUPPORT
AB Indicators based on citizens' satisfaction that enable territorial comparisons of the performance of public policies could be useful in decentralized States. But what accounts for citizen (dis)satisfaction with these policies? We examine Spaniards' satisfaction with three policies: education, health care (whose competencies lie with the Autonomous Communities) and pensions (Central Government) by utilizing a representative regional-level survey. We conclude that there are differences in the degree of satisfaction with these policies across regions, especially in cases where regional governments hold the main responsibility. The differences among degrees of satisfaction still remain, albeit to a lesser extent, even after controlling for individual and contextual variables. On the basis of these findings, the next step should be to analyze the extent to which different degrees of satisfaction are due to different patterns of policy management in education and health.

AB To what extent can age, period and cohort effects explain the low levels of political interest in Spain? Age cannot account for the evolution of the aggregate levels of this attitude, whereas generational replacement may be responsible for some degree of change in the medium to long term, although it remains to be determined whether this effect would raise, reproduce, or lower aggregate levels of political interest. Finally, it is advisable to control these effects with the period, the only factor capable of provoking short-term changes in the aggregate level of this attitude. The article also tries to shed some light on the mechanisms responsible for the different levels of political interest among cohorts. It concludes that the degree of social and economic development experienced while growing up is crucial.

AB This paper analyzes the way participants change their mind in a deliberative forum. Its contribution lies in studying the extent to which these changes persist over time. We start from Mackie's assumption that changes of opinion in a deliberative context cannot be interpreted by considering isolated variables, but must be based on individual attitudinal networks in which preferences are embedded. The results show that certain changes after deliberation are not maintained by some individuals. The paper details the importance of certain variables in the change of opinion in the short and long term, as well as the relationship that exists between different attitudes (information, preferences, beliefs and political efficacy) at three different times before and after deliberation.

AB By analyzing all the flows of rural exodus, urban concentration and urban deconcentration in a single comprehensive system, we can find settlement logics characteristic of each socioeconomic stage. This article attempts to synthesize these patterns, which lead to changes of prominence in territorial dynamics between different habitats and migratory typologies that occur over time. We conceptualize the resulting model as territorial transition. Although it has a theoretical link with important precedents, it can be considered an original contribution, since it has not previously been conceptualized in such detail. The narrative sequence has two parts. It begins by presenting the basis, the theoretical background and the stages of territorial transition, and continues by drawing a contrast with the observed reality of the Spanish case, analyzing in detail certain key specific features. In conclusion, we highlight that the formulation of this model may allow the interpretation of apparently confusing or conflicting phenomena of other international territorial systems.

AB Considering the variables of nationality, generation and social class, the article analyzes representations of citizenship within the sphere of public services. By combining three logics that of recognition, that of autonomy and that of merit, discourses break the essence of the classical notion of citizenship by modulating different accounts of practices and experiences regarding what it means to be a citizen. Through the analysis of the discourses produced from different social conditions in focus groups, it is possible to understand the main elements of value associated with the concept of citizenship. The progress of strategies that reward individual merit supersedes the logic of universal recognition, with important effects on the most vulnerable groups.

AB This paper aims to understand the behavior of Spain's main media within a specific electoral context: the 2008 General Election. To this end, we analyzed the coverage of the major Spanish newspapers (El Pals, El Mundo and Abc) in order to determine whether their agenda setting and framing had political motives, in addition to the merely informative intention. Spanish media had at least two options within the context of the elections: to offer their readers a neutral coverage or, on the contrary, to taint it with obvious partisanship. Our findings demonstrate the predominance of the latter option.

Firstly, the paper analyses the way these platforms emerge and the nature of these actors, who are compared and contrasted to the Nimby phenomenon. Further, the paper studies and compares - through the tools used to analyse collective action - their discourse, organisational structure and how they channel their demands. Finally, the paper offers a reflexion on the nature and impact of this new type of actor, present in the political arenas of some regions and it compares them to Nimby networks, social movements and pressure groups.

ID ACTIVATION; SELF
AB The meaning of unemployment has changed considerably in recent decades. The currently prevailing representation of unemployment stresses the central role played by the management of so-called personal willingness. Activation policies have largely embodied this transformation of the concept of unemployment, and the spread of this intervention paradigm has gradually shifted the focus of attention towards the management of subjectivity. This paper presents some results of a recent qualitative study of recent activation employment policies. Based on the experiences of different players (coordinators, guidance professionals and users) concerning this intervention model, the research analyses management strategies for dealing with the contradictions related to the production of subjects stemming from these activation policies.

DT Article
DE Policy Making; Traffic; Safety; Accidents; Law Enforcement; Rationality
AB Empirical evidence undoubtedly shows that new road safety policies enforced in Spain since 2004 have had a positive impact on driver behaviour, which has subsequently produced a considerable reduction in crash fatalities. However, researchers have yet to analyze the social mechanisms at work and, specifically, what impact these policies have had on citizen motivation. Have they had the "pedagogical" effects that are often taken for granted? After analyzing all the data which allow us to answer this question,we conclude that they do not show any positive change in citizen motivation, and that increased compliance seems to be due exclusively to deterrence.

AB This article explores the role of individual resources, situational factors, and the socialization process in the persistence of a gender gap in political dispositions, principally in political interest. We pay special attention to situational factors, especially those related to the time devoted to housework and caring responsibilities. Despite the growing participation of women in the labor market and increasingly comparable levels of male and female educational attainment, the enduring unequal sexual division of household tasks reduces women's time availability as well as the pool of skills, resources and social networks which could foster their political engagement, thus helping to sustain the gender gap in political interest.

DE Job Mobility; Labour Trajectories; Labour Market; Underemployment;

AB The objective of this paper is to show to What extent it is possible to speak of the existence of permanently precarious or discontinuous trajectories in Spain, beyond the well-known age effect. The available variables for the 2001-2006 period coming from the Fundacio Jaume Bofill's Inequalities Panel have been exploited by means of a cluster analysis coupled with a logistic regression. The results of this analysis show that gender and age are among the most important variables when determining precarious trajectories. These results also seem to point towards the existence of a generation gap in labour trajectories, although the limited length of the available panel data does not make it possible to state that this gap can be extended to any social profile.

AB This article attempts to answer two related questions: what is a social norm? And how does it generalize? It is argued that a social norm is neither mere sanctioning behaviour, nor behaviour which just satisfies other's expectations; but both conditions are simultaneously required for a social norm to exist. By means of an agent-based simulation, it is shown how a reinforcing dynamic between the execution of sanctions and the generalization of expectations explains the generalization of a social norm, provided a critical mass of unconditional sanctioners does exist. Furthermore, it is shown that the larger the social density, the smaller the critical mass required in the population.

AB For some years now, Spanish media have highlighted the numerous corruption scandals investigated by the judiciary. All this information could have led to a more widespread perception of corruption, as shown by different surveys and indexes. The main object of this article is to analyze the quantitative and qualitative features of corruption in Spain and to determine whether there is a correlation between hard data on corruption and perception of the problem. In this text we have tested three hypotheses by examining judicial statistics, the contents of judicial inquiries and data from different surveys and media. This article contributes to a better understanding of the main features of the problem and opens the way to more detailed research on its causes and consequences.

ID OLDER; DEPRESSION; CONTACT; PEOPLE
AB Widowhood has an emotional, economic and relational impact. This paper analyzes the transformations which take place in the personal support networks of widowed persons. In our analysis we have used different regression models (Poisson) in which we examine the effects of personal, contextual and attitudinal variables on support networks. The data come from the Social Relations and Social Support module of the International Social Survey Program 2001. Our conclusions show that widowed persons have smaller support networks than those in relationships, although there are differences based on sex. The greatest loss in support occurs in the secondary family network. Geographic mobility increases the family network but decreases that of friends. Familist attitudes and lower social trust contribute to maintaining these personal networks.

First, we focus on models linking the European vote to national political concerns (Second Order model) and the domestic electoral cycle (Mid-Term model), and then we assess the capacity of a model based on the role of party positions and campaigning (Europe matters model) to explain occurrences which are at odds with traditional interpretations. Finally, we present a composite model in order to provide a more solid explanation of the 2009 European election results.

AB Of late, issues of social inequality have assumed a new political centrality in many western societies. However, in much discussion of these issues, sociological approaches to the analysis of social inequality have been disregarded, especially in the work of economists and epidemiologists. The main features of the sociological approach are the emphasis given to inequality in a relational rather than a merely attributional sense, and the distinction between social class and social status as two qualitatively different forms of social stratification. Two cases serve to illustrate the limitations and dangers that result from neglecting the conceptual and empirical work undertaken by sociologists: the study of intergenerational social mobility by economists and the study of the consequences of social inequality for health and related social problems by epidemiologists.

AB This paper analyzes the process of implementing gender equality. in North-South development cooperation. The hypotheses argue that the background of these processes involves a homogenizing desire whereby the goals of the West should be the goals of the world. The theoretical discussion is based on modern feminist critical theories. The first part reviews the main theoretical reflections related to post-modern feminism, and the second section provides empirical information on the relationship between Colombian and Aragonese NGDOs. The main conclusions state that, on the one hand, post-modern feminist theories represent an advance in the understanding of current patterns of development cooperation. On the other hand, in practice, "gender equality. on the development cooperation agenda often reproduces a type of patriarchal authority.

DE Eating habits; Utopias; Modernity; Food preparation; Expert knowledge
AB Social studies on food and nutritional authorities coincide in emphasizing the paradoxical situation of the modern eater: people know how they should eat but do not eat as they should. Dealing with paradoxes successfully usually requires a certain -linguistic and disciplinary- distance to gain sufficient perspective. We suggest this should be done from the historical perspective that a sociology of utopia offers on the conflict between food imaginaries. To this end, we outline the common elements of utopian/dystopian thought in order to extract the categories of major interest for a sociological analysis of food policies and eating behaviours. Subsequently, we trace the ways in which some classical utopias and dystopias have focused on-or blurred-the question of food and we try to draw some conclusions.

AB When called upon to deliver judgment, citizens must believe that government is capable of affecting economic outcomes. Economic integration arguably reduces the power of governments to act independently in response to macroeconomic shocks. This paper seeks to determine whether institutional changes implemented by 12 European countries in the wake of monetary integration affected economic voting, and whether such changes were mediated by party messages. It employs statistical analyses across 12 European countries at two points in time. The results show that differences in economic voting were mediated by perceptions of EU integration; voters who believed in delegation at EU level weighed up economic issues to a lesser extent when casting their vote. In addition, such findings were to a large extent driven by partisan concerns.

ID VOTER NEWS SERVICE; ELECTION; FORECASTS
AB Nonresponse bias (and, to a lesser extent, measurement error) has become the main source of error for electoral forecasts in Spain. Although the post-stratification techniques and ratio estimators currently used in the polling industry reduce deviations, they do not show enough capacity to mend the biases introduced when collecting data. This research reveals how a more efficient use of the electoral information available outside the sample could help to significantly improve the accuracy of predictions, and uses simulation techniques to show that this may be accompanied by less expensive sampling designs. The analysis, nevertheless, also concludes that the proposed specification is not a panacea and affirms that there is still scope for reducing nonresponse bias, pointing to several issues for future research.

ID WELFARE-REFORM; BACK AGAIN
AB Domestic service is one of the secondary labor markets that have grown in the context of globalization. Its dynamism is linked to the demand for cheap female labor to satisfy needs within the sphere of domestic reproduction. The characterization of the U.S. domestic service labor market in the early 21st century on the basis of survey data shows that (now as in the past) its growth is based mainly on the influx of immigrant labor, nowadays mainly from Latin America. Domestic workers' poverty levels, coupled with their low educational achievement, merely corroborate the fact that the growth of this labor market in developed societies is yet another of the regressive consequences observed in the world of work within the context of globalization.

AB This article analyzes variation in bombings during conventionally fought civil wars. It establishes a number of hypotheses based on a theoretical framework that emphasizes the role of political factors in accounting for violence. In addition, it takes into account emotional factors such as citizens' revenge aspirations. The hypotheses are tested with data on bombings perpetrated by the Francoist side in 1,062 municipalities of Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). The results confirm that the aerial strikes are positively related to local political support for the rival group in the prewar democratic elections, as well as to executions perpetrated by the rival group during the war. The former is consistent with the political hypothesis; the latter is consistent with the revenge hypothesis.

AB This paper examines whether the results of in-person and telephone survey interviews are equivalent to those obtained via self-administered, on-line questionnaires. Of the eleven variables analyzed, five showed significantly different levels of item non-response (the highest in the on-line survey). Analysis of item-response distributions across survey formats reveals differences in all variables, although there is more response pattern similarity between in-person and telephone interviewer-administered surveys than between either of these and the self-administered format. While respondents to both interviewer-administered survey formats state their belief in the benefit to be gained from surveys and particularly in the sincerity of survey respondents, the level of approval is always higher among those interviewed in person. The on-line respondents show greater confidence in surveys, more interest in following survey-related news items and more faith in their usefulness.

DE Simulation; Experiments; Complexity; Nonlinear Analysis; Unintended

AB Agent-based modelling is a new research method that allows the complexity, emergency and nonlinearity of many social processes to be managed in a simple way. In this paper we define agent-based modelling-and its different classes on the basis of a classic example: the Schelling model of urban segregation, which seeks to explain how it is possible that ghettos can arise in cities where citizens have no racial prejudices. Finally, some of its possible applications are considered: developing, formalising and assessing sociological theories; deciding amongst rival theories about the same social phenomenon; integrating different theories in a common setting; explaining social dynamics through their micro-mechanisms; carrying out experiments in a virtual world; assessing social policies and their a priori results; and predicting certain social phenomena.

AB This paper analyzes economic voting in decentralized contexts. The existence of several arenas of political competition allows for the appearance of vertical electoral contamination processes, implying that voters do not evaluate the performance of national and regional governments independently. Using the case of Spain in the period 1982-2008, it is demonstrated that this electoral contamination spreads from the national arena to the regional one, and not the other way round. However, electoral contamination tends to diminish as the process of decentralization takes place over time.

This tool, called Gender & ICT Indicators System (GICTIS), is an advance in the measurement and analysis of the difference between men and women in the Information Society. Its application allows us to a) make inter-gender comparisons, determined by their degree of e-equity; b) carry out intra-gender analysis according to the degree of e-inclusion of each sex; and c) contextualize the results obtained with the corresponding thirty-one European countries. Furthermore, this transnational analytical perspective is specified in the ranking of countries that are used to establish five classification categories according to the level of ICT use, combined with the degree of existing gender equality.

AB This paper deals with historical memory in Chile from a theoretical life course perspective. For this purpose, the topic is conceptualized on the basis of a collective and historical generation component concerning the memory of different age groups in the six municipalities of the metropolitan area of Concepcion (Chile). The information was gathered by means of a standardized questionnaire, and the sample comprised individuals spread across five different age groups. The results show a memory of recent history centered on national events for the whole sample, incorporating supranational elements among younger cohorts. The study confirms the existence of both national and generational memories centered around various significant socio-historical changes.

DT Article
DE Immigrants; Racism; Tolerance; Normalization; Gender
ID SEGREGATION
AB This article reflects critically on a number of works which consider immigrant inclusion processes from perspectives which view groups of immigrants as cultural minorities defined by their collective identities. In contrast to such perspectives, it proposes a conceptualisation of these cultural groups as structural social groups, and their construction will therefore be explained as arising from a similar position on social axes of disadvantage, through structural social processes of inequality, such as systemic racism, the division of labour, or the process of normalization. Finally, a gender perspective is included in order to explain relational processes of the social structure generated specifically by motives of gender which, nonetheless, tend to be rendered invisible not only in theoretical debates, but also in political discussions concerning immigrant inclusion policies.

AB How control is exercised in organizations remains a central issue for the study of workers' behaviour. The Foucauldian concept of disciplinary power could prove useful, even though Foucault made virtually no distinction between different modalities of disciplinary control. Our purpose here is to investigate different forms of organizational control through the discourses of different kind of workers (35 in-depth interviews and 11 focus groups). Although classic forms of control remain important, new logics and modalities seem to be emerging, which are characterized by the attribution of responsibility and initiative to workers. However, this apparent self-disciplining conceals a greater estrangement between workers and the source of power, which renders organizational control invisible and hinders resistance to these new logics.

AB This article analyses the relationship between employment in ethnic niches and socio-occupational mobility among Polish immigrants residing in the Community of Madrid. Based on survey data and in-depth interviews, the study combines quantitative and qualitative methods. The data shows that both Polish males and females are concentrated in two specific ethnic niches: construction and domestic service, respectively. In this context, socio-occupational upgrading is heavily conditioned by gender and depends on the allocation of productive and reproductive roles among men and women within households, as well as on the opportunity structures available within each ethnic niche.

AB This research paper seeks to confirm the hypothesis according to which political consumerism can be considered a form of political participation that cosmopolitanism is helping to develop. After analysing the theoretical implications of this hypothesis, the study presents an operationalization of cosmopolitanism which shows its greater presence among those individuals who have bought or boycotted products for ethical, political or environmental reasons. This is followed by a further verification of the association between cosmopolitanism and political consumerism, controlling for the effect of the main socio-demographic variables on the latter. The study confirms the hypothesis that political consumption can be regarded as a form of political participation related to cosmopolitanism.

DE Non-response; Voting behaviour; Weighting; Online polls; Calibration
AB The internet has brought about a genuine revolution which is opening up exciting new research opportunities for social scientists. As a survey tool it offers obvious advantages for electoral polling that deserve to be explored. In connection with the 2010 Universitat de Valencia chancellor elections, an online scientific poll of an electoral process was conducted for the first time in Spain. The survey clearly showed the general trends of the election and the order of the candidates in the race, influenced the campaign strategies of candidates and made it possible to confirm two hypotheses that a priori we thought they would take place about the behavior of electors: the effects of gender and faculty. However, despite attempts to adjust estimates, post-stratification and calibration techniques were unable to correct non-response bias adequately: the forecasts systematically underestimate the winning candidate outcomes.

AB The public participation processes that are taking place in Spain as a result of the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) constitutes an important step forward toward the democratization of water management in Spain. Grounded on document analysis and exploratory interviews, this article highlights some of its strengths and weaknesses. In general, the most problematic aspects of these processes are related to their lack of credibility for some potential participants, as well the persistence of an institutional setup for water decision making that strongly favors the long-standing relationship between Basin Management Agencies and traditional water users. The article offers some concluding remarks on the need for a reformed institutional desing for the management of water resources, according to the idea of governance expressed by the WFD.

AB This article analyses party loyalties in the Andalusian regional elections of 2004 and 2008. Our results show that party identification is the main factor explaining the vote in Andalusia, particularly in the case of the socialist vote. In this regard, party loyalties among the Andalusian electorate not only induce voters to vote for a particular party, but also act as a perceptual screen. Consequently, party loyalties reduce political differences with the reference group and increase ideological differences with other political groups.

Seven hypotheses are formulated in relation to status attainment in general and aspirations and expectations in particular. We present breakdowns of educational and occupational aspirations and expectations by gender, parental education and school. The analysis is completed with structural equation models which offer an integrated theoretical perspective on the causal structure of ambition in the Spanish context. We examine the consequences of our conclusions for theory and policies.

AB Previous research has shown that in highly repressive contexts, the emergence and continuity of activism cannot be understood without considering the role of strong subjective, affective and emotional elements. Building on this approach, this article offers a longitudinal analysis of the activism of the first generation of clandestine anarchists under Franco's dictatorship (1939-1975). The results point towards a combination of three factors that help explain the maintenance of anarchist activism. These are: i) the role of hope in the perception of opportunities for mobilization; ii) the strategic mobilization of indignation in the discourse directed at potential supporters and participants; and iii) the strengthening of the ideological identification with the movement due, paradoxically, to the effects of repression. The sources used include a range of archival material as well as activists' memoirs.

DT Article
DE Max Weber; Rationality; Religion studies; Philosophy of history;
   Judaism; Hinduism; Confucianism
ID SOCIOLOGY; CHINA
AB This article analyzes Max Weber's sociology of religion, focusing on the emergence of world religions. For this author, the universal tendency towards rationalization is an historical force that has to confront other forces, leading to unique situations in each historical case. Thus, ancient Judaism can be seen not only as a forerunner of the West, but also as the result of a combination of historical factors which allowed the rationalizing driving force to spread with greater strength, enabling it to be used as an heuristic tool for the comprehension of other civilizations. Chinese or Indian cultures are seen as processes where rationalization has been hampered or inhibited. By regarding ratio as a universal driving force, Weber builds his philosophy of history. Thus, Weber's view of Modernity is seen through its metahistorical roots.

AB This article discusses whether activation policies have had a positive effect on beneficiaries of minimum income protection in Catalonia (Spain). The article first confirms that social assistance beneficiaries with higher employability levels have greater chances of finding a job. Second, the article identifies different profiles of beneficiaries and examines the characteristics of those who did not find jobs in a favourable economic context. The results suggest that it is personal problems that act as barriers. Third, the article also examines to what extent public management is responsible for the results. For this purpose, it compares the performance of administrative units, controlling for the characteristics of their clients. Finally, the article discusses whether making social assistance dependent on activation is a good strategy for the majority of beneficiaries with particularly difficult profiles, and what administrations can do.

AB This article aims to address the effects of political decentralization on the regional political elite. We observe whether a bifurcation is taking place regarding the national elite, through a predominance of local and regional careers. We use a descriptive approach of the political careers of the regional presidents and prime ministers in Spain, France and United Kingdom, comparing amongst countries and periods of time. The data suggest the existence of different patterns, in which local and national paths tend to dissociate, creating distinctive cursus honorum. Spain is the best case to observe the arise of political careers linked to the new regional institutions.

DT Article
DE Citizen participation; Spatial planning; Urban policies; Theoretical

ID MOVEMENTS
AB Pluralist and one-dimensional views are prevalent in the analysis of citizen participation processes linked to spatial planning processes. This article examines the definitions of such processes as proposed by authors with elitist, conflictualist and, in general, multi-dimensional perspectives. Their contributions provide more suitable theoretical frameworks for social investigation purposes and highlight important variables such as the role of experts, the origin of participatory initiatives and their socio-political consequences. We maintain that multi-dimensional perspectives offer a more comprehensive approach to the analysis of urban policies in which citizen participation is embedded. Hence, the article focuses on four multi-dimensional approaches, their main differentiating features, and the ways in which they represent an alternative to one-dimensional conceptions of citizen participation in terms of the collective exercise of power and the actors and methods involved.

AB This article introduces a scale for expert evaluation of the democratic quality of a political system. It is inspired by the democratic audit conducted by the Human Rights Centre at the University of Essex, and consists of 57 items classified into five blocks: citizenship, laws and rights, representative system, accountable government, civil society, and international dimensions of democracy. It has been validated twice through a voluntary sample of more than one hundred experts in Sociology, Political Science and Economics in two consecutive years. Other latent dimensions have been discovered by means of exploratory and confirmatory factorial analysis, and a reduced version of 14 items has been proposed in order to apply it to the general population. Finally, high coefficients of validity and reliability of the scales and subscales were obtained.

DE Electoral Systems; Electoral Behavior; Political Representation;
   Candidates; Ideology
ID ELECTORAL SYSTEMS; INCENTIVES; DELEGATION; RULES; VOTE
AB When voters cast their ballot, are they choosing a candidate or a party? Electoral systems have a significant impact on how this question is answered in each country. As previous literature has shown, some electoral rules foster a more personal representation, while others strengthen the intermediary role of parties. In this paper I Maintain that there exists a trade-off between these two types of representation. To empirically verify its existence and how it works, I have chosen local and regional elections in Spain as a case study. Given that they take place simultaneously under similar electoral systems, they can be considered a natural experiment for the study of this trade-off, which allows me to overcome the potential problems of endogeneity present in previous studies. By measuring the significance of ideological closeness and candidate evaluations in voters' decisions at each level, it is shown that the importance of personal representation increases in local elections at the expense of a less frequent use of ideological proximity as an informational shortcut, thus confirming the existence of the trade-off.

DE Water Supply; Debate; Internet; Social Networks
AB This paper deals with the transformation that water policy in Spain has undergone in recent decades. The erosion of a strongly united hydraulic policy community ha S given way to a widespread and plural network in which modern hydrological policy is under discussion. In this network, a new discourse about sustainability (the "New Water Culture") brings new State and non-governmental actors together in an innovative form of "issue politics". We document this phenomenon by using research strategies drawn from analyses of public issues or the Internet. More precisely, we trace the "New Water Culture" network on the Web, analyse its structure and consider the political meaning of its history. On the basis of the study carried out, we claim that a hydrological policy commonwealth has emerged on the Internet.

AB This paper analyzes collaboration strategies for the provision of services at local level in the municipalities of Spain, United States and Norway. It focuses on the importance of these strategies and how they are carried out in the cases mentioned, as well as the role that various factors play in such strategies. For this purpose, attention is paid to elements of the social, economic and political dynamics of the municipality, but also to the institutional design elements which shape the position that local authorities occupy in the intergovernmental system in each case. This requires an analytical approach at two different levels, which we call meso and micro respectively. The meso level concerns institutional design elements that operate in the municipality as a determining factor in the collaboration models, whilst the micro level deals with those elements located in local political society that determine the local authorities' opportunities for carrying out their strategies.

ID ETHNIC ORGANIZATIONS; POLITICS; STATE; ASSOCIATIONS
AB This article examines immigrant organizations from three perspectives: their relationships with public authorities, the system of relationships established among these organizations, and their degree of internal participation. My principal aim is to analyze the extent to which one can speak of a civil society in this domain. The study presented takes the case of immigrant organizations in Spain, focusing on those organizations that benefit from greater public recognition through the Forum for the Social Integration of Immigrants, a consultative body of the Government. In-depth interviews with chairpersons and workers in these organizations are combined with contributions from the literature on social movements, on ethnic mobilization and on social capital, to explain the Spanish situation. Connecting the dynamics of immigrant organizations with those of other social organizations in Spain, it is argued that the relationships established with public authorities are neither balanced out by a dense inter-organizational network, nor harmonized by the active participation of their members. These factors work to the detriment of a true civil society in this domain, having negative implications for the organizations' capacity to act as creators of social capital, and for the integration of immigrants. This brings into question the role of the State in supporting immigrant organizations.

This article analyzes the collective work of the Chicago Women's School from interdisciplinary positions and the science-reform confusion in the context of early 20(th) century United States. For this purpose we analyze their works published in the American Journal of Sociology from its inaugural issue until 1920, and by so doing we aim to reflect on the politics of gender and recognition within the social sciences and the supposed neutrality of their history.

AB This paper shows the results of a research project on relative social mobility patterns in Spain during the second half of the 20(th) century. The data were collected by the Spanish National Statistics Institute for the Survey of Incomes and Living Conditions (2005). This empirical material has not been used previously and it provides new data about the last decade of the 20(th) century. The social fluidity models created by Erikson and Goldthorpe in The Constant Flux (1992) have been applied. In short, this paper confirms that the rates of the social fluidity remain invariant during this period and that the patterns of core social fluidity for European countries closely match the Spanish case. Nevertheless, this mobility regime has certain particularities resulting from the characteristics of Spain's social and economic structure.

ID LEAVING HOME
AB The aim of this research is to examine changes in the transition to adulthood in Spain during the last two decades of the 20(th) century. The three most important dimensions of this phenomenon are: 1) the transition from the education system to the labour market (entry into the labour market); 2) the process of leaving the parental home to settle in an independent household (leaving home); and 3) the change in family status from being a "child" to a "parent" (family formation). The study is based on the 1981 and 2001 Censuses collected by IPUMS-International (Integrated Public Use of Microdata Series) at the Minnesota Population Center of the University of Minnesota. The method used is the "entropy analysis of status combinations", which offers a synthetic indicator of the transition to adulthood, together with two other indicators: "transition spread" and "age congruity". The results show a great concentration on the transition within a specific age range, and a six-year delay in the transition to adulthood between 1981 and 2001. We conclude that the life course became far more complex during this period, particularly for women. We also observe a territorial convergence in the patterns of transition, as the examples of Catalonia and Galicia prove. Despite our data limitations, this method has proven to be superior to traditionally applied techniques due to its ability to collapse different life course dimensions into a unique cross-sectional indicator.

AB Using micro data from a continuous volunteer web survey (CVWS), the WageIndicator (WI), this paper. firstly analyses the type of bias that such a survey method produces. Secondly, following a "model-based" approach, two alternative data weighting methodologies are implemented. Thirdly, in order to test whether weighting corrects the bias, thus making it possible to obtain conclusions applicable to the whole labour force, the efficiency of the weighting methodologies is evaluated. Since the WageIndicator is a labour market oriented survey, weighting efficiency is evaluated by calculating mean salaries, inequality indices and salary regressions before and after applying weights to WI data, and by comparing the results obtained with those achieved using the Structure of Earnings Survey (SES), a wage survey run by the Spanish National Statistics Institute. It is concluded that, after weighting, estimated statistics and parameters move in the right direction.

ID VOTING-BEHAVIOR; 2ND-ORDER; INFORMATION
AB Following 20 years without popular consultations, three referendums have been held in Spain since the year 2000. A common feature of these processes is their high abstention rate. Indeed, the majority of the population did not turn out to vote in any of the three referendums. Most studies on electoral behaviour in referendums, both in Spain and other countries, centre their attention on explaining the outcome of such consultations, but little research has focused on interpreting the reasons for abstention. This research study analyses the lack of participation in referendums by examining the case of the referendum for the Reform of the Statute of Autonomy of Andalusia (referendo para la reforma del Estatuto de Autonomia para Andalucia) held on 18 February 2007. Using empirical evidence obtained through a post-electoral survey and discussion groups, we show that the lack of information, the incoherency and ambiguous position of the main opposition party, as well as the general discontent of a segment of autonomous government party voters, led to one of the lowest turnouts in Spain's electoral history.

AB The current ecological crisis has brought about an environment of fear that affects many people in society. In this article we study how environmental fear influences ecocentric attitudes and practices in Europe and how it intertwines with a sacred interpretation of nature. Religion can be regarded as a cultural, response to collective fears, aid therefore we analyse how it reacts to new environmental fears. The article draws special attention to a new eco-religion named Cosmic Piety by Giner and Tabara. The data used in the research comes from the ISSP Environment survey of 2000, covering 13 European countries. The results show that environmental fear activates ecological behaviour and that Cosmic Piety scores high in environmental fear as well as in ecocentric behaviour. Religious beliefs tend to be more prone to environmental fear, but the main difference with Cosmic Piety is the lack of transcendence in the interpretation of the sacred essence of nature.

AB This paper deals with the various "sexual cultures" in different societies, their socio-sexual order and their sex/gender systems. For a better understanding they are classified into two main groups: digital systems (more rigid societies) and analogical systems (more flexible societies). If it is true that there are multiple sexual ideologies that "naturalize" different ways of understanding the masculine and the feminine, homosexuality and heterosexuality, among other things (Mead, 1972, 2006), it can be concluded that the "masculine domain", heteronormativity and the dual sex/gender model are not universal realities, but are characteristic of concrete sex/gender structures.

AB Spanish migration in the second half of the twentieth century was initially characterized by its mass and unskilled nature, followed by an interregnum of return processes and finally by a stable migration, not mass but highly skilled. In terms of focus, this emigration of qualified Spaniards was relegated to the background by mass immigration to Spain at the end of the twentieth century. This article considers the relationship between spatial mobility (migration of Spaniards) and its possible impact on the upward social mobility experienced, for which purpose we use data from the international survey EIMSS (European Internal Migrations Social Survey) and Goldthorpe's occupation-based class mobility procedures. The analysis is complemented by a simulation on class mobility, in order to display and compare the effects of Spaniards' emigration to France, Germany, Italy and Britain on social mobility.

AB The paper focuses on public policy making for homosexual unions in Europe. It addresses these policies from the perspective of recognition, a concept drawn on the literature on civil rights and minorities. As a criterion for evaluation, the test of recognition demands the satisfaction of a twofold condition: firstly, democracies must be prepared to accept even the most costly of the demands as presented by the representatives of sexual minorities (in this case the right of joint adoption); secondly, public policies must show respect to the prevailing model of citizenship, not imposing visions of difference when difference-based claims are treated with disregard in the political community, and, conversely, not pursing assimilation and homogeneity where the prevailing tradition points at policies based on the recognition of difference and diversity. Ultimately, this article seeks the development of a new interest on this subject among political scientists and sociologists. The paper draws on the analysis of law-making in Europe since 1989.

AB This article investigates how post-hire organizational processes behind evaluating and rewarding employee performance shape wage inequality within organizations. Using personnel data from one. large private service organization, I identify and test the two main stages of a common contemporary employer practice -the extra compensation of workers using performance reward programs- in which racial and gender disparities can be introduced in the distribution of wage increases. This article shows that the first stage of the performance reward program -the performance evaluation rating stage- is affected, because of its subjectivity, by gender, race or nationality biases. Beyond this first stage, this article also highlights that bias still affects the translation of performance ratings into wage increases during the salary setting stage: My longitudinal analyses show that in the long run different wage increases are given to employees who have received the same performance evaluations, whereby equivalent employees (i.e. in the same job and work unit, with the same supervisor, and the same human capital) receive different wage increases even after having been given the-same performance evaluation score, simply because of their gender, race or nationality. I conclude with a discussion of the relevance of these findings to our understanding of how frequently-used organizational practices such as performance-based salary rewards generate gender and racial gaps in wages within jobs in contemporary organizations.

AB Although non-ideological voters make up. a considerable share of the electorate, the literature has systematically overlooked their voting behaviour. Using Spanish electoral data from the 1979-2008 electoral period, we seek to identify the alternative cues -in the absence of ideology- these voters may use when casting their ballot. We do not find that evaluations of the incumbent's performance have a greater influence,on non-ideological voters, as the retrospective voting literature suggests. Nor do we find that other shortcuts such as candidate evaluations or party identification are used more by this group when they vote. Instead, our results indicate that non-ideological, voters have exchanged the traditional ideological shortcut for simple pro-incumbent voting as a decision rule.

We explore the data by describing the indicators and then checking whether it is possible to identify the same modes of online political participation that are usually identified in the offline arena.

DE Birth Interval; Work-Life Balance; Employment; Fertility; Housework;

ID UNITED-STATES; EMPLOYMENT; ENGLAND
AB Birth intervals' have rarely been considered a phenomenon worthy of study in developed countries, but rather a mere consequence of individuals' decisions about total family size and age at first birth. However, women may be using birth spacing as a strategy to make employment and motherhood more compatible. The aim of this paper is to shed light on the analysis of the influence that women's attachment to work and received help with housework can have on the length of second birth intervals. For this purpose, I have taken information from a sample of 871 Spanish women aged between 35 and 49. The data have been obtained from the Fertility and Family Survey for Spain, conducted in 1995. The results obtained from some multivariate linear regression models indicate that the strong attachment to work negatively affects the length of second birth intervals, especially among highly educated women. However, the positive effect of help with housework on the interval can counteract the influence of the abovementioned characteristics.

AB In this paper we use the method of counterfactual simulation to estimate the number of strategic votes transferred from the United Left (IU) to the Socialist Party (PSOE) in the last three Spanish general elections. The strategic voters we refer to a re those who, in spite of IU being their first political preference, voted for the PSOE in order to attain representation benefits. The counterfactual simulation procedure is used to examine how the predicted individual probability of voting for a party changes when the strategic incentives at constituency level are removed. Our results lend support to the hypothesis that IU's electoral and parliamentary collapse was due in no small measure to the strategic behavior of its followers.

ID CHAIN STORE PARADOX; FISCAL PERFORMANCE; INSTITUTIONS; FEDERALISM;
   REPUTATION; POLITICS
AB The main purpose of this article is to analyze the explanatory factors of regional financing instability. The analysis is based on an extensive-form game and shows that instability is the result of a combination of national and regional governments' rational strategies. On the one hand, central government is unable to build a reputation as a strong player and refrain from using the modification of regional. financing to maximize its electoral strategies. On the other hand, the particular design of decentralization in Spain prompts regional governments to continually renegotiate financing agreements. Renegotiation incentives have to do with the asymmetries between the common and "foral" systems of financing, the overly transfer-biased system, and the ongoing revision of the distribution of powers across levels of government. Instability will be contingent upon the institutional context that gives rise to perverse incentives. Therefore, no matter how strongly central government commit to set up a stable system of financing: the instability will surely continue provided that the current structure of incentive remains.

DE Social Exclusion; Homeless People; Forced Mobility; Public Space
AB Throughout history, homeless people have been associated with nomadism and with itinerant poverty. This paper aims to show that the social exclusion which affects those who live on the streets takes the form of a process of forced mobility. Firstly, the paper considers the factors or agents that promote this forced mobility, and then reflects on the legal measures that seek to give coherence to the various attempts that have been made to remove homeless people from certain places. These,anti-homeless laws,, purport to promote a more effective regulation of public space. At present, however, the forced mobility of homeless people is related to the current predominance of certain narrow definitions of public space.

DE Work in Prison; Learning a Trade; Socialisation; Rehabilitation; Social
   Reintegration; Opinion of Inmates
AB This paper is based on a research project carried out by the "Centre de Recerca del Treball i la Vida Quotidiana" (QUIT) of the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona on prison work in Catalonia. Our starting hypotheses were as follows: working and learning a trade contribute to reintegration into the labour market and thereby to the future social integration of inmates; and the more resources the penitentiary system in question provides, the better it will fulfil the duty that society entrusts to it. For the basis of our study we used a representative survey of inmates who work in the nine prisons of Catalonia. In addition, we conducted in-depth interviews with experts and people in charge of the penitentiary system, and visited various prison workshops to observe the inmates at work and conduct interviews with them. The result of the study has allowed us to confirm that prison work acquires several functions. Firstly, it provides inmates with earnings that enable them to meet personal or family needs. Working in prison allows them to make better use of their time and helps to avoid conflictive situations. It also provides working habits and improves social relationships. In spite of the fact that only a few of the jobs enable inmates to learn a trade, they appreciate the work they do inasmuch as it helps them to "normalise" everyday life in prison, while at the same. time offering them prospects for future reintegration.

DE Field; Capital; Habitus; Nomos; Epistemology; Kurt Lewin; Pierre

AB The notion of field played a central role in the scientific projects of Kurt Lewin and Pierre Bourdieu. In this paper we carry out a comparative analysis of their theoretical and methodological use of this concept in their prolific output in the fields of psychology and sociology, respectively. For this purpose we focused on five crucial issues that both researchers explored in the process of developing their respective field theories: the break with partial objectifications, the construction of the object, the internal dynamics of fields, the delimitation of their boundaries, and the mathematical representation of psychological and sociological facts. We conclude with a summary in which we highlight some important coincidences and differences in the respective field theories of Kurt Lewin and Pierre Bourdieu. Both assigned it similar epistemological functions, but in Lewin we can find more mimicry with regard to the idea of field from physics and its mathematical formulation possibilities, whereas Bourdieu's notion of field is inseparable from those of habitus and capital, which facilitates a more integrated analysis of micro, and macro-social phenomena, a more sophisticated appraisal of its temporal dimensions, and more precise criteria for establishing the boundaries of a field.

DE Child Mortality; 1940 Census; Retrospective Information; Spanish Civil

ID AGE; COHORT; PERIOD
AB Following a method proposed by W. Brass, this paper uses 1940 Spanish census data on retrospective fertility (based on questions addressed to married women about numbers of children born alive and surviving children at the time of the census) to estimate the survival levels of women's descendants at different ages and, therefore, child mortality up to the age of 15. The results show that the Spanish Civil War worsened child survival in practically all Spanish provinces, especially those of Andalusia and. Levante, whereas the least affected provinces were those of Catalonia and the Northern Meseta, in spite of-the fact that these two regions had had opposite experiences of child mortality before the war, with low levels in the former and high ones in the latter. This would seem to indicate that, although a region's level of development should be inversely related to its population's vulnerability to unfavourable situations, the previous demographic situation does not seem to significantly influence child mortality during the war.

The aim of the paper is: 1) to contextualize. the concept in the field of crowd psychology in 19(th) century France; 2) to trace the semantics of the concept in the different uses developed by the author; 3) to analyze the distinctive feature of effervescence in relation to non-conceptual collective representations; and 4) to characterize the opposite concept: vie serieuse. This approach allows us: a) to consider the function of social effervescence without focusing its comprehension solely on the effects that it generates; b) to identify how collective representations work in integrating and regulating social processes, and c) to focus the understanding of collective representations in relation to communication processes.

AB Six years after its sinking, images of the Prestige remain etched in our memory: an overturned, leaking oil tanker losing part of its load and being towed out to high sea over the course of six days, during which time the tanker split in two and sank to a depth of 3,500 meters. The fuel reached the coast in several waves, affecting Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, the Basque Country, and to a lesser extent, France and Portugal. Fishermen, shellfish gatherers, and thousands of volunteers took it upon themselves to prevent the worst consequences of the slick. Demonstrators gathered en masse in Santiago de Compostela... Never before in Spain had a disaster of this nature had such media, social, and political impact. What implications did this have for policies designed to prevent and combat environmental disasters? Did these public policies change as a result of this event? In this paper, frame analysis applied to public policy analysis is used to answer these questions. In other words, the paper analyzes the prevailing discourse regarding these public policies, how the problem is defined, what is identified as its cause, how the problem is situated geographically, to whom the problem and liability for it is attributed, what the proposed solutions are, what or who the targets of the policies are, the places at which these policies are aimed, and who should act to solve the problem. This analysis enables us both to conclude that the Prestige disaster did not bring about an essential change in Spanish public policies designed to prevent and combat marine oil pollution, and to draw lessons for improving the effectiveness of the public Policies analyzed.

AB In this paper, I argue that the State's agenda deals basically with issues of development, governance, and equality. Starting out from this premise, I explore whether the differences between countries in terms of these three variables have a structural pattern and, if so, how stable this pattern is throughout the period under study. Using cluster analysis, I conclude that the world can be divided in two main groups whose composition remains relatively stable. In addition, it is shown that the governance gap between the two groups tends to diminish, but this is not followed by a concomitant improvement in development and equality gaps.

AB Although rarely contemplated by social science, social associations constitute emergent forms inside the third sector's "organizational galaxy". This article attempts to shed light on this reality by first defining the concept of social association itself, placing special emphasis on the autonomy of these associations and on the dynamics and processes they generate. We then make an approach to the European context in which social associations insert themselves, with structural and cultural factors that influence their development. As original associative forms, they differ from other subjects in the private and social arena depending on their purpose, fields and types of intervention, resources, internal organization and associative culture, and all of these aspects will be analysed in this article.

AB The central objective pursued here is to learn about the perceptions that young offenders with criminal responsibility have regarding the practices of the system for re-education and re-socialization that attempts to provide an answer to their needs and problems (as established in Spanish Law 5/2000). We have considered, for the purposes of this aim, that the most favourable sphere for discovering what the actors themselves have to say is to be found in the type of measures applied in centres where there is loss of liberty, in which the effects of the system and the consequences arising from face-to-face relations between educator and offender can be seen most directly, with the least possible tainting by influences from other agents. It is in this context that it is possible to make a better appraisal of the repercussions that discourses on the aims pursued (re-socialization and emancipation of the minor) and, in particular, the coherence that can be expected between the social and personal needs of the minor being held in custody

ID CONSEQUENCES
AB The manipulation of the Spanish electoral system carried out by the political elites that led the political transition has been proved by several studies. This manipulation moves through the existence of a large number of low-magnitude districts and its interaction with malapportionment, the Hondt formula and, above all, the variance effect of district magnitudes. In this paper I will discuss another bias that has not yet been studied by researchers, and which also paved the way for UCD victories: the turnout bias. I will show how the manipulation of the electoral system led UCD to win systematically in the districts where there was low turnout and how its opponents won in districts with high turnout. Therefore the "price" of the seats for UCD was lower. This bias has remained and it favours those parties that have support in the districts with low turnout which are, at the same time, more overrepresented.

DE Environmental Concern; Social Perception; Attitudes; Spain
ID FALSE-CONSENSUS; EGOCENTRIC BIAS; UNIQUENESS; PREVALENCE; FOCUS; SELF
AB This paper examines the relationship between individual behaviour and social perception regarding Spaniards' behaviour on environmental issues in the theoretical context of the cognitive biases of false consensus and false uniqueness. A survey carried out by the CIS (2005, study no. 2590) on 2,490 citizens from a representative sample of the Spanish population was used. The results showed that individuals with a moderate frequency of pro-environmental behaviours tended to project their own behaviour on all Spaniards. However, individuals with a more extreme kind of conduct, because of high frequency of pro-environmental behaviours, tended to attribute to others a different conduct from their own. These individuals considered themselves to be different from the rest of the population. It was also found how the differences in social perception of the. behaviour of Spaniards on environmental matters are associated with different perceptions of environmental deterioration and concern for the environment.

AB Women participation in Spanish sociological journals is analysed during the period 2001-2005, by means of bibliometrics and Social Network Analysis. There is a predominance of men (75,08% of authors) compare to women (24,92%), despite the fact that there is a majority of women ending University studies. This inequality starts to be perceived from the beginning of their research and professional development and it intensifies with time. As a result, only a reduced number of women reach the highest positions in the academicals rankings, which correspond to authors-with the highest productivity. Related to that, it has been observed,a phenomenon of bottleneck, according to it as the number of women writers reduces, the productivity threshold increases. There must be studied in depth the barriers that make difficult the development of a professional course among women and to carry out a diachronic monitoring of the professional occupation and their contribution to papers.

AB Methodological adequacy of survey when measuring racism and xenophobia has been discussed in previous studies. The aim of this paper is to improve measurement through survey methods. First, a theoretical approach is made to the concepts of racism and xenophobia, considering the different forms and aspects of their measurement according to existing theoretical and empirical research. Secondly, the main errors that may crop up when recording such phenomena are dealt with. Then, we move down to the level of the indicators used. The effectiveness of the traditional indicators used in CIS surveys, which are compared with << new >> indicators applied earlier in the European Social Survey (2002-2003), is assessed using the articulation of multivariate analytical techniques (cluster and discriminant) in both analysis and validation samples. These,new,, indicators end up by showing greater effectiveness when measuring attitudes against immigration, due mainly to the question format adopted in the questionnaire. Nevertheless, measurement errors are still detected and some proposals for dimensions, indicators and question formats are given in order to help advancing in the complex detection of latent racism and xenophobia.

DT Article
DE Citizenship; Democracy; Citizen Participation; Rights and Duties;
   Multi-level Analysis; Europe
AB The idea of democracy is probably one of the easiest to get consensus about in contemporary societies, while at the same time there are clear symptoms of political disaffection. The explanations for this political disaffection phenomenon are quite varied. While some argue that the lack of political implication is a consequence of individualism and << civic privatism >> that threatens to break the bonds within the political community, others argue that this is a consequence of the crisis of the politics led by elites, which gives way to new forms of political participation driven by the masses. Lying behind these contradictory explanations there is a debate about the normative concept of citizenship or the << good citizen >>. In this paper I analyze empirically different conceptions of citizenship in Europe, as measured by how much value individuals attach to different civic duties that belong to the definition of citizenship from a normative point of view. In order to do that, I distinguish one dimension of normative commitment and one of community commitment. I then explain the value attached to each dimension at the individual level using multilevel analysis techniques.

Together with different forms and degrees of repression, these include the substantial restructuring of the State and the broad reallocation of public resources, which are derived from a responsive approach to conflict resolution. Through a multivariate research design, this Study evaluates the outcomes of the main responsive policies that have been implemented. In particular, the analysis shows that the establishment of Basque self-governing institutions has substantially mitigated political extremism, both with respect to the attitudes people and terrorism.

AB This article illustrates how gender is an explanatory factor in the characteristics and forms of action of a social movement that is not based on gender issues: the protest against the National Hydrological Plat) (year 2000) in Tarragona. It examines how gender roles and identities shape the political practices of female activists, in terms of motivation, handicaps, resistance and facilities for their political participation. With all of this, the article shows the usefulness of incorporating the gender perspective into the analysis of group action in order to achieve a more appropriate understanding of social mobilization processes.

AB The new institutional approaches have penetrated heavily into the different social sciences in recent times. These approaches have studied the institutional framework of federalism on new theoretical bases. This note starts by laying the foundations of the bases for a second generation of economic theories of federalism, which point to the central role of institutions in the research agenda on federalisms, and analyses the relevance that dynamic views on institutional change has from the institutional approaches. These theoretical notes open a research agenda that establishes bridges between the programme of institutional analysis of federalism and the programme of institutional change.

AB Created with the dual purpose of monitoring social change and bringing improvements into the creation and design of instruments for measuring that reality, the European Social Survey (ESS) has now completed its third round. This methodology paper expresses thoughts on the usefulness of analysing the accumulated data from the first two rounds in the process for ongoing improvement of the survey. And so, in the case of Spain, the experience accumulated in the earlier rounds has been used to 1) validate the questionnaire, 2) finely tune the sampling design to the characteristics of the country, and 3) substantially improve the quality of the data obtained. The paper shows how the coordinated effort of the Spanish ESS team and the polling agency has resulted in a remarkable increase in the degree of compliance with the survey targets, which is a fact that guarantees the representativeness of the sample finally obtained.

DE social movements; collective action; globalization; anti-globalization
   movements; democracy; political representation
AB As the old organization of politics based upon the Nation-State gave way to national social ovements, the emergence of transnational social movements is decisively fostering the contemporary re-definition of post-national politics. In fact, it cannot simply be stated that globalization has produced transnational forms of collective action; globalization is, in part, the outcome of an early transformation of social mobilisation. Be that as it may, it looks as though social theory has not yet responded properly to the current displacement, from national movements, comfortably set up until now in the familiar framework of the Nation-State, to some transnational movements that do not respond to such a well-defined institutional context. This paper attempts to shed some light on these new transnational movements, paying special attention to the anti-globalization movement and a desire to explain its relations with the liberal political order.

DE fashion; urban tribes; youth culture; Zaragoza
AB In the world of contemporary design, the individual genius of the creator is less important than his skill for harnessing the trends that are generated in the street. This paper analyzes the way in which designers create and one of the most important protagonists of creativeness in the street: young urban tribes. In order to understand the link between both kinds of creator, it is not just cultural climates and atmospheres that are considered to be important. Beyond the fizzy metaphor, there is a suggestion that there is a pneuma (or spirit) that tribes help to create and which designers must know how to find their way through. The most important issues examined in this paper are how Aragonese designers navigate their way through this pneuma and how it is generated by the urban tribes of Zaragoza.

ID SEX DISTRIBUTION
AB In Spain, the masculinization of rural towns and villages is an endemic process. In order to enquire into the reasons for this, an analysis is made of the evolution of different cohorts of people born in rural towns and their migratory behaviour using different variables: their level of education, work situation and mobility practices, particularly in relation to labour markets. This analysis makes a comparison between the region of Castile and Leon, where the phenomenon is the most intense, and the Autonomous Region of Valencia, where masculinization appears to be much more reduced. The conclusions seem to indicate that the processes governing whether rural women stay put or uproot themselves are related to employment prospects and access to spatial mobility. The restricted nature of rural labour markets resolved by using commuter and migration strategies as a way of accessing urban employment, strategies that are clearly differentiated by gender.

In this article, an analysis is made of the strike frequency, participation and lost working days during the period 1987-2006. We relate these figures to the industrial distribution of employment, the unemployment rate, the existence of regional pacts and agreements and the political orientation of the population. The regressions show the influence of all these aspects on the frequency, the magnitude and the volume of strikes.

DT Review
DE disability; social identity; marginalization; social structure
AB This paper proposes the analysis of disability from a sociological perspective similar to that of the Anglo-Saxon social model. It implies a critique of the traditional perspective, according to which disability is understood as an impairment suffered by an individual, abstracting it from the socio-cultural context in which it takes on meaning (the medical-physiological model). If this context is taken into consideration, we can verify that disability, as a social phenomenon, includes three interconnected areas: daily practices, social identity and social stratification. This analysis implies the development of a theoretical framework that sets disability in terms of,difference,, in order to show the reasons by which it turns into marginalization, exclusion and oppression. In addition, that theoretical framework has to be created by developing empirical studies that gather the experience of disabled people themselves.

DE European Workers' Committees; trade unions; collective bargaining; labor
   relations; employers; multinationals; Spain; Europe
AB Since September 1994, when the Directive 94/45/EC on the creation of European Works Councils came into force, the trajectory followed by their introduction in Spain has been similar to the one in the European Union. However, in spite of such parallel evolution, the coverage rate in the multinational companies with headquarters in Spain or those adhering to Spanish legislation on this subject, has always been lower than the European average. The priority of the Spanish multinational companies towards Latin American markets -with the resulting exemption of the obligation to create a committee with the above characteristics- but also the existence among Spanish employers of a cultural conception that is particularly reluctant to share control of the company's power with its workers, the persistent "local" vision of collective bargaining and the labour relationship by the Spanish unions, are some of the main causes that surface when it comes to explaining the small degree of development experienced by European Works Councils in Spain in respect of what is happening in the rest of Europe.

It aims at showing the relationship between the generation of practical acquisition processes (ethnomethods) of some body activities and the development of a practical sense (the one that Bourdieuan habitus refers to) and certain affective economy (the one that the Eliasian habitus refers to) throughout continued immersion in such activities. In order to do this, the study of a practical sense acquisition and a certain control over violence in the generation of normal patterns during the practice of aikido and boxing was chosen.

DE field theory; sociology of culture; state; Max Weber; Norbert Elias;

AB Bourdieu created the concept of field, taking his inspiration from Weber, in order to analyse cultural F production. Later he extended it to highly varied realities. In this extension, the concept showed great methodological advantages, but lost precision. Furthermore, Bourdieu combined the Weberian anti-functionalist methodology with a critical version of classical functionalism. In this article we evaluate the virtues and limits of the concept. Using Weber, we show the advantages of the concept for analysing cultural production. Combining Norbert Elias with an analysis of Dobry and Mann, we evaluate the usefulness of the concept for analysing, from a non-functionalist perspective, state organizations. Analysing the dynamics of autonomization of the fields, we specify the meaning of autonomy. We conclude by proposing a delimitation for applying the concept to particular social domains.

AB The study of intellectuals has been transformed into an autonomous discipline, characterised by a differentiated analytical object and placed between different academic fields such as history, sociology and political science. In this article, we shall take a brief look at the main theoretical and methodological currents on this theme, and shall place them within the historical context in which they appeared. We shall see the appearance of intellectuals as a result of the way modernity has developed, and how the first theoretical approaches that attempt to understand its configuration start emerging. This phenomenon has spanned the entire 20th century and crossed into the beginning of the new millennium where, again, passionate academic debates on its continuity or disappearance have been unleashed. The death of the intellectual as a social actor is debatable but today, the validity of studies about intellectuals is undeniable.

DE nuptiality; Spain; men; temporary employment; unemployment; housing;

ID MARRIAGE; COHABITATION; EUROPE
AB Spaniards are getting married later and in smaller proportions. Gary Becker's economic theory of the family and Oppenheimer's theory of marriage timing try to explain these trends. The aim of this paper, focused on men's nuptiality patterns, is to determine whether the hypotheses derived from such theories apply to the Spanish case. To this end, the Spanish Labour Force Survey is used, and the method of artificial cohorts and logistic regression are applied. The findings show that unemployment, fixed-term contracts, the cost of access to the housing market and women's absolute rate of employment are negatively related to the likelihood of getting married. From these results, a discussion on how Spanish society has handled the socio-economic changes that have taken place in the last three decades with respect to the process of family formation is established.

   logistic regression; Spain
ID GENDER
AB Today, the segregation of occupations according to sex is an invisible frontier that structures the production system (61% of all workers find themselves in occupations that are either predominantly male or predominantly female). Our main purpose in analysing occupational segregation is to understand whether this separation implies differences in opportunities and/or labour rewards. In order to carry out this study, first the very phenomenon of occupational segregation is described and quantified with the help of the 2001 Census (to avoid sample error, something which might occur if we work with a very disaggregated -three digit- National Occupational Code, CNO-94). Then, through multinomial logit regression and using the Labour Force Survey (EPA) and the Survey on Salary Structures (EES), personal characteristics, jobs and the businesses associated with segregated occupations are studied. The results demonstrate both the quantitative importance of the phenomenon and its close relationship with gender stereotypes. Furthermore, some characteristics of female occupations that call the theory of human capital into question and clarify some assumptions of the theory of labour market segmentation, emerge.

AB The article examines the factors that support a glass ceiling for women in politics, especially, at the local level, and, by extension, in political life. focusing on the demand factors, in particular the predominant organizational culture within political parties. To do so we analyse the application of legal parity in the 2007 local elections, the first elections held after the introduction of a quota which grants a minimum of 40 per cent and a maximum of 60 per cent to either sex. Given the large amount of candidatures presented throughout the state, this research focuses on Catalan municipalities with more than 5,000 inhabitants where the quota was enforced. The existence of parties with internal quotas and parties that have not adopted them allows us to test whether legally imposed parity blurs differences between both groups in relation to women's representation.

DT Article
DE democracy; citizenship; Latin America; social movements; Zapatismo
AB This article studies democracy in the Councils of Good Goverment (Juntas de Buen Gobierno, or JBG) in the Zapatista Movement. The JBGs are analysed as a study case for upholding a proposal for research into democracy in Latin America: that the political social movements in the region are, contrary to common belief, useful tools for the analysis and improvement of democracy in Latin America. The point of departure is that, according to the United Nations Development Programme (2004), effective elections live side by side with high levels of poverty and inequality in Latin America. This combination represents various risks for the continuity of democracy in Latin America. This piece of work joins forces in the task of researching and discussing democracy in order to assist in its taking root in Latin America. The article proposes: 1) a definition of democracy that is supported on human dignity, and 2) an analysis of the political social movements that are useful for the study of democracy. Starting out from this approach, the text looks into the political institutions and processes of the JBGs. The JBGs are the institutionalization of the regional political management processes in the Zapatista territories. For that reason, is important to consider the JBGs in the improvement of democracy in Latin America.

TI The social perception of divorce in Spain
SO REVISTA ESPANOLA DE INVESTIGACIONES SOCIOLOGICAS
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE divorce; public opinion; attitudes; Spain
AB Divorce is a reality that was soon introduced by democracy in Spain. The divorce law was passed in 1981. This was only possible because the social context was right and because of the existence of favorable perceptions, that recently allowed a new, even more liberal, reform to take place: the 25th anniversary of its legal existence. First, this project proposes an analysis of the history of re-search into the perception of divorce in Spain. It focuses on the period when the law originated, at the end of the 1970s, and extends to the beginning of the 21(st) century, this analysis moving arounc two basic aspects: its acceptance and justification. The results show perceptions that have evolved quickly but which define a bipolar tendency. Spain is one of the countries where divorce is most justified, but it is also one of those that shows a large social group that adopts traditional positions.

AB All texts about sampling present vie available methods for sample selection and the characteristics that the universe which is the object of study must possess, in order for the most suitable method to be selected. All of them point to the need to have prior knowledge of the universe before carrying out any sampling. This implies that there has to be some source that provides detailed knowledge of the object of study domain. This requirement poses some difficulties when the samples are selected from the population in general. These difficulties are due both to the limited access to documents reporting the characteristics of the population living in a specific area, and to the inaccuracies that these documents contain. This is why the samples drawn from the population in general use various methods of sampling jointly In this paper, an evaluation of the quota sampling applied to the 2004 Barometers of the Sociological Research Centre is carried out.

AB This article examines the relations among three crucial variables within the literature o social capital. It discusses the conceptualization of each of them and how to make them operational, and analyzes their mutual interactions and the role of other classical variables, such as voluntary associations, in their origins. The survey data come from the Citizenship, Involvement, and Democracy project, undertaken in 12 European countries between 1999 and 2002. The empirical findings run in the opposite direction to the patterns established in most of the literature regarding the relationships between social trust and political confidence, between social trust and satisfaction with democracy, and the arguments supporting the idea that voluntary associations create both social trust and political confidence. The implications of these findings are both methodological and substantive.

AB This paper analyses the dimensions of the support given by Spaniards to the European Union (EU). In order to do this, the main theoretical approaches that exist for explaining European public opinion, which are based on affective, utilitarian and national political factors, have been taken into account. The three theoretical viewpoints are tested, independently and jointly, through various regression analyses in order to find out which are the elements that most influence the Europeanism of Spaniards. Our research shows that the perception of the economic and social benefits that community integration carries with it continues to be the main dimension for explaining the favourable attitudes shown by Spaniards towards the EU. However, affective aspects, such as confidence in European institutions and identification with Europe, are also highly relevant. The political factors are of secondary importance, but it can be seen that satisfaction with the performance of national democracy is related to the integration of citizens into the European political system.

As well as clarifying the key role of demographic developments in the rise of modernity, the concept of reproductive revolution offers a better way to integrate sociology and demography. The former has tended to pay insufficient heed to sexual reproduction, individual mortality and the generational replacement of population. Some key results of the reproductive revolution are discussed. As well as reviewing some empirical evidence for the concept, its implications for debates on the demographic transition, failing fertility, the social regulation of sexuality, the decline of patriarchy, rise of reflexive indentity, "population ageing" and family, are briefly discussed. The article discusses these ideas in relation to arguments about the family and fertility initially proposed by Davis (1937).

ID ORGANIZATION
AB In the same way as any other type of social organization, NGOs evidence the existence of gender inequalities in their structure and internal functioning. This paper aims at analysing this issue in the case of Development NGOs, through the study of the practices, dynamics and rhetoric that go on inside them. Particular attention is paid to one of its effects: the (in)visibility of women in this kind of organization, an examination being made of the two dimensions of this phenomenon. On the one hand, the paper studies the invisibility of gender issues, which arises out of the inequality that exists in such organizations. On the other hand, we focus on the excessive visibility of anything that goes against established rules, starting out from the processes of change in the gender roles that are occurring in some Development NGOs.

DT Article
DE action; power; resistance; domination; bound; subjection; work;

AB In this paper we present the analysis of a work experience under the Methods Time Measurement (MTM). This analysis can help us shed some light on the enigma of how and why, in certain contexts, we sustain with our action relations of subjection that we experience as injurious and which we cannot accept as being legitimate. We shall defend the thesis that the special combination of commitment and resistance that is present in the production carried out by workers establishes them as subjets of the production bond, to the extent that they develop and express in that combination their sense of autonomy and their own dignity and self-respect. At the same time, however, we shall see how that resistance binds them to subjection, as it makes the production order possible and efficient. At least in this case, if the workers sustain an injurious bond it is because their actions take place in a veritable iron cage where their dignity has turned into one of the basic pillars of their subjection.

DT Article

ID SECULARIZATION; COUNTRIES
AB This paper shows the results of an empirical and theoretical analysis intended to determine the current state of religiosity in Europe, that is, the degree to which Europeans give their allegiance to either a religious world view or a secular one. Applying multiple correspondence and cluster K-means analysis to the data gathered from the ISSP European survey "Religion-II", a new typology based on five basic cultural positions has been developed: religious; believers; sceptics; agnostics and atheists. These results show the quantitative extent and the qualitative importance of scepticism. Through an interpretation of the contents of each type, it shows that the scepticism regarding both religious and secular world views represents, at this particular moment in time, an essential key to European culture. We cannot affirm that there is a return to religious matters, but it is clear that the secularisation process has lost some of its original strength. Post-modern Europe is immersed in a cultural crossroads, and will have to decide about its future. The article ends by showing the three possible strategies for settling the doubt: the Kierkegaardian resolution, whereby Europeans will take up either exclusive religious or secular positions; the Borgian solution, whereby religious and secular content and forms will be hybridized; and the Hegelian dissolution, through which Europe may possibly develop a new cultural synthesis built from the remains of the old secular and religious world views.

AB The aim of this article is to propose a theoretical approach for the sociology of sociology which results in two basic practical tools. To start off, the article puts forward a general criticism of the sociology of sociology that takes its inspiration from the classic observations of Merton and Gouldner regarding the improvisation used when carrying out work on the sociology of sociology. After this, we propose two theoretical tools, both of which are based on the ample tradition of the sociology of sociology, for carrying out work in this field: "historical-practical criteria,, and minimum research workforce". These tools make it possible to provide an answer to three key questions that are very often glossed over - How does a particular author see himself? How do others see him? From what viewpoint is he actually looking? - to help us avoid the problems we have analysed critically in the first part of the article.

DE political parties; nationalism; electoral performance; political

ID POLITICAL-PARTIES
AB Electoral support for ethno-nationalist parties is based on the mobilisation of ethnic and cultural identities, which are generally understood to be primordial and, therefore, deeply rooted and highly stable. This paper poses the following question: to what extent do ethnic or national identities provide nationalist parties with a competitive advantage with regard to other parties, based on other types of allegiance, such as class or religion? In order to answer this question, the paper compares the incumbent nationalist and non-nationalist parties of the regional governments of Canada, Denmark, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom in the last five decades with respect to three empirical indicators: electoral performance, fluctuation of voting levels and how long governing parties stay in office. The results suggest that incumbent nationalist parties are, in general, less severely punished by voters at election time than non-nationalist parties, especially in coalition governments. However, this apparent advantage does not provide nationalist parties with longer periods in office.

AB This article examines the xenophobia that exists on two levels of population density in Almeria province: towns and suburbs with high immigrant density levels. We conclude that the density of immigrants encourages xenophobic attitudes and behaviour among the population, both among individuals who live in towns and among those who live in suburbs, as well as the differentiation and segmentation of xenophobia depending on the country of origin. Moreover, negative stereotypes regarding undifferentiated immigrants have a higher xenophobic referent, and this perception decreases as interaction in a neighbourhood context increases.

AB How can the proportionality of proportional representation (PR) systems be measured? This question has been confused with the question of the so-called "thresholds of representation". This article reviews the history of the discovery of thresholds by political science, attempting to clarify their conceptual foundation and the misapprehensions surrounding them. Their valid use as an electoral system proportionality measure is ruled out, and the notion of thinness (measured by Droop) is proposed for replacing them. The article concludes with possible conceptual contributions that are brought together in a terminological proposal.
