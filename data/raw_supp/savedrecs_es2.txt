ID GLOBALIZATION
AB Cosmopolitanism represents a way of dealing with difference and similarity within changing societies in a globalized world. Amongst other things, cosmopolitan theory claims that the cosmopolitan feels part of a community transcending the borders of national societies and actively embraces diversity among people. Yet, we know little about what cosmopolitans are like and what distinguishes them from non-cosmopolitans on empirical grounds. Using data from the Eurobarometer 57.2 (European Commission 2002), I explore the link between cosmopolitanism and a subjective meaning of 'being European', i.e., whether cosmopolitans express different European identities compared to non-cosmopolitans. Results of statistical analysis show that many people feel close to fellow Europeans and thereby express one kind of cosmopolitanism; however, it remains difficult to say who these people are as socio-demographic variables play a negligible role. With respect to the meaning of 'being European' it is striking that cosmopolitans have not only developed a stronger but also a more open European identity. This confirms central normative claims of cosmopolitan theory and demonstrates further possibilities to strengthen cosmopolitanization across Europe.

ID BUSINESS TRAVEL; MOBILITY; WORK; GENDER
AB International business travellers are sometimes described as a cosmopolitan elite, with a strong international orientation but a low preference for local involvement and local obligations. This article uses Swedish survey data to investigate these claims, by comparing the orientations of persons who frequently travel abroad at work with the orientations of other workers. Frequent international travellers generally have more cosmopolitan orientations than others, but the local ties are not significantly weaker among frequent travellers than among occasional travellers or non-travellers. In some respects, notably social networks and associational activities, international travellers tend in fact to be more involved than non-travellers in all the four examined spheres - locally, regionally, nationally and internationally. Concerns among social theorists that highly mobile, locally disconnected elites are undermining social cohesion may therefore be exaggerated. Theoretically, the study suggests that localism and cosmopolitanism should not be treated as necessarily opposite and mutually exclusive phenomena, but that mobility in various forms may be used to combine local and cosmopolitan resources.

AB This paper suggests a cross-country comparative framework for the study of inter-organizational relationships. It provides a perspective that links the micro, meso and macro-levels of analysis, dealing with the following issues: (a) the role of socio-organizational factors in relationships across organizational boundaries; (b) legal contractual arrangements, human capital features, and the practices of using information and communication technologies as key factors in the environment in which inter-organizational relationships are embedded; and (c) convergence versus divergence of cultural and institutional patterns of national business systems. Also, the effects of governance regime (Anglo-Saxon vis-a-vis Continental-European) and population size (large vis-a-vis small) are argued to play an important role in determining the quality of inter-organizational relationships across Western European national business systems. The conceptual argument presented in this article is illustrated by reference to Germany, the UK, The Netherlands and Ireland.

   DUALISM Some lessons from Ukraine

DE informal economy; economic development; active citizenship; social

ID INFORMAL ECONOMY; TRANSITION; NAPLES; WORK
AB This paper evaluates critically the conventional hierarchical representation of the formal/informal employment dualism, which depicts formal employment as extensive and positively contributing to economic development and social cohesion, and the separate realm of informal employment as weaker, inhabiting the margins and impairing progress and development. Although the discourses of informal employment as weak, marginal and separate from formal employment have been previously put under the spotlight, there has been little questioning of whether informal employment is a negative phenomenon. Through a study of Ukraine, however, this paper finds evidence that informal employment positively contributes to not only economic development as a seedbed for enterprise and entrepreneurship but also social cohesion as a primary vehicle for delivering community self-help. The outcome is a call for a finer-grained understanding of informal (and ultimately also formal) employment that recognises its plurality of forms and their varying consequences for economic development and social cohesion.

AB Various mechanisms, including lower productivity, discrimination and composition effects, have been cited to explain the disadvantaged position on the labor market of young people, women, and persons nearing the end of their working life. This article relies on two hypotheses. First we adopt the perspective of life cycle theory, therefore this phenomenon is also understood as a consequence of giving priority on the job market to fathers between 35 and 40 years old. Second we consider that having a job and the level of earnings are two different dimensions of the labor market and of the way people can be advantaged or disadvantaged. In the case of the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary in the period running from the 1980s to the early 2000s, the arrangements made vary in time and by country, as is shown by employment chances and earnings for a variety of groups, corresponding here to the life stages of youth, motherhood or fatherhood, and old age. This information brings to light which groups are disadvantaged and in what way. The configurations observed change with the countries' economic and socio-political transformations, becoming more diverse by country at the end of the period. Older workers appear excluded from the labor market in Hungary; young people in Poland are integrated but paid relatively low wages; in the Czech Republic, where employment rates are relatively high, mothers are less likely to work.

TI EFFECTS OF DIVORCE ON CHILDREN'S EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT IN A

DE divorce; Italy; intergenerational effects
ID FAMILY; DISRUPTION
AB Previous research has found parental divorce to have negative effects on children's educational attainment; in addition, it has been noted that the effects of divorce are not the same in all western societies. However, research on Catholic and southern European countries is missing. The aim of this paper is to add to the research on the relation between parental divorce and the educational attainment of children in Catholic and southern European societies. Italian society differs from other western societies with respect to many characteristics of its family structure, its cultural and religious systems, its social welfare system, and also with respect to the legislation, frequency and characteristics of divorce. Based on data of the Bank of Italy Survey of Households' Income and Wealth, we find that the educational level of the children with divorced parents is lower than the educational level of children with married parents. The analysis indicates that the education of children born to the least educated divorced mothers lags significantly behind children of the least educated married mothers, while the educational level of children of highly educated mothers does not deviate from that of children of highly educated mothers who remain married. Next, contrary to what has been found in other European societies, this research shows that widowhood has a significant negative effect on children's educational attainment as well. Finally, the study also demonstrates that the negative effect of divorce cannot be explained by the negative impact of the religious climate of the region of residence.

AB Until recently data on mortality by socioeconomic status were not available for the initial period of mortality increase in the former Soviet Union from 1965 to 1979. Newly discovered data from the Russian State Archive of Economics allow us to close this gap and to compare mortality trends in urban Latvia and several urban areas of Russia with the concentration of rising male mortality among manual workers already found in several eastern European countries. A similar trend appears in these data for rising mortality to concentrate among manual workers over time. Unfavorable trends in the life expectancy of the total population were largely driven by mortality increase among manual workers. Possible determinants of the pattern include a special type of economic growth in the USSR in the 1970s and 1980s associated with dominance of heavy industries and military sector, and low consumer goods' production, high prevalence of hard manual labor, massive rural-urban migrations and poor living conditions of new coming industrial workers, growing psychosocial stress and high prevalence of adverse health behaviors. These characteristics are discussed in the framework of an incomplete modernization and distinct health life styles in state socialist countries.

AB In this paper we theoretically and empirically explore the question whether the unequal distribution of different aspects of social capital (networks, trust, norms) over a number of social dimensions (gender, age, income, employment status, and educational level) is smaller in countries with more developed welfare systems. Our data cover 13 Western industrialized countries and two periods in time (1981, 1999). The paper adds to the existing literature in several ways: by focusing explicitly on the empirical study of social capital inequality, by relating this subject to (quantitative and qualitative) welfare state characteristics, and by studying it from a cross-national and longitudinal perspective. We find that in the sample of countries analyzed there is no clear relationship between social capital inequality and welfare state characteristics. However, whether generally welfare states do not reduce social capital inequalities remains an issue for future research.

AB This article investigates socio-structural cleavages in relation to social policies in Switzerland. It examines the extent to which vertical stratification, age and gender explain variation in individual social policy preferences. We use survey data on reported voting behaviour in 22 direct democratic referendums on distributional issues between 1981 and 2004. Our two main findings are the following: (1) age seems to be the most relevant line of conflict in most distributional issues and (2) vertical stratification (income and education) and gender are less important in explaining individual voting decisions. Our data also suggest that material interests based on socio-structural characteristics account for only part of the variation in social policy preferences, and that value cleavages are also important.

AB This article studies the impact of a range of state institutions on citizens' contacts with family and close friends in 20 countries. Recent studies have shown large country level differences in social participation. We aim to explain these differences from an actor centered institutionalist perspective. We present two lines of reasoning. According to the first, a high level of social security crowds out social participation, as intimate networks are no longer needed as an economic safety net. The second line of reasoning proposes that corruption or a lack of civil rights drive citizens to seek refuge in their secure intimate contacts. In a comparative, multi-level design we focus on participation in the nuclear family, in the extended family, and with the best friend. We test the two lines of reasoning simultaneously on ISSP 2001 data. We find that states matter. State institutions are an important determinant of social participation. Our findings mainly confirm the second line of reasoning, whereas the crowding out thesis is only supported for contact with the extended family. Moreover, we find that the contextual effects are not similar across social groups: the poor are more strongly affected by the institutional design than the rich.

It starts off with the thesis that life circumstances and social networks (especially family and neighbourhood) have a greater influence upon the understanding of the role and importance of education then age. We have analysed the quantitative and qualitative data from the research on social networks of the elderly in Slovenia and focused on two generations (parents and grandparents) at two different points in time (1987 and 2005). We have established that regardless of the various external encouragements, the most important factors for further learning are family values and the individual's attitude towards learning that is formed throughout life and is influenced by social networks.

AB In this paper we address the question of the relative importance of within and between country differences in income and material deprivation in the European Union in the context of recent suggestions that insufficient attention has been paid to the latter. In particular, we respond to the argument that the 'state bounded' relative income approach obscures the significance of EU-wide reference groups. Making use of EU-SILC 2004, we have sought to quantify the magnitude of relevant within and between country differences and their relative impact. Overall, our analysis supports the view that the predominant frame of reference is a national one. The limited impact of European reference groups observed in our analysis does not require explanation in terms of the emergence of a European social stratification system. Furthermore, the significance of such comparisons depends not only on the expectations of those affected by European inequalities but on the degree of legitimacy afforded to ensuing demands. While an EU-wide income-threshold can provide information regarding progress of the Union towards greater social cohesion, its usage for this purpose does not require a strong sense of European identity. Given the current status of the European Social Model, it would seem unwise to attribute an undue degree of policy relevance to the relatively modest impact of EU-wide reference groups revealed in our analysis.

ID IDENTITY; TOURISM; TRAVEL
AB To what extent can the experience of travel become also a journey of self-discovery leading to a reconstruction of identities? Taking 'a year out', inter-railing, going abroad on a language study or an au pair stay: these are some of the most common forms of youth travel in contemporary Europe. As almost ritual ways of moving, they may be likened to initiation journeys. This article explores the significance of travel in young people's lives, and in the process of identity construction. These issues are explored in the travel narratives of a group of young people who took part in an autobiographical and mixed method project on identities which was conducted in England and Italy. The meaning of travel in these young people's lives is appreciated through their own words and written diaries. Young people's agency and role in constructing their travel experiences is analysed, as well as the extent to which fate, in the shape of societal expectations and norms, as well as parental intervention, may actually predefine some forms of travel as 'institutional' rites of passage. Travels may offer a scenario for an individualised construction of self, which may also involve the co-participation of significant others. The experiences of young women backpackers in this study point out how travelling can still be a way of defining alternative gender identities.

ID FAMILY
AB This paper focuses on eco-communes as sites of resistance and political activism. Based on a post-structuralist narrative analysis of interview materials, this paper elaborates on the ways in which life in a commune is narrated and represented as an identity project with a mission to bring about social change. The environmentalists studied make sense of their choice to live in an eco-commune as something that was triggered and facilitated by important crossroads and fateful moments that they had encountered in their past life. They also work on their identity as eco-communards by discursively problematizing their personal relation to themselves (self) and to others (spouse and family), as well as by constructing new forms of subjectivity, intimacy, and relatedness through communal life. Life in the eco-commune thus represents a form of resistance and political struggle that Michel Foucault has referred to as politics of self; it represents not only direct opposition against the social order of contemporary Western consumer society but also more subtle resistance against the normalized forms of subjectivity that it entails.

TI WHO CHOOSES THE WEDDING GUESTS, THE COUPLE OR THE FAMILY?

DE wedding; wedding guests; family relations; relationality
ID CULTURE
AB Marriage has become an individual choice in most European countries. In this article we study entry into marriage, i.e., weddings, which in the contemporary research literature are often presented with an emphasis on modernity: consumerism, celebration of romance, and the experience of a unique and individual occasion. The wedding guests are an important part in the making of 'the perfect day' but the topic has largely been neglected in the literature. In this study we analyse the selection of wedding guests in 12 weddings (six French and six Finnish) to investigate the dynamics of the interplay between individual preferences and the determinants that are more relational in origin. Three empirical questions are presented: first, who is responsible for choosing the guests? Second, what is the distribution of wedding guests between kin and non-kin? And third, who are the non-kin guests: are they friends first met by the couple alone, or also by the wider family? The results show that despite the predominantly individualistic discourse expressed by the couples, a wedding is still a familial affair: the configurations of family ties are influential in constraining as well as enabling the choices available to the couple.

TI SHARING THE SAME FATE

ID HELP
AB Peer support has become a growing source of consolation for individuals in contemporary social life. This article examines the social bond between selves and their fellow sufferers 'sharing the same fate' in support groups and personal networks. Analyzed fateful conditions include serious illness, premature loss of a spouse through death or abandonment, infertility and family disruptions. The results show that selves colonized by agonizing life experiences confront social isolation and turn to their fellow sufferers in order to find understanding. A distinct kind of social bond is proposed between fellow sufferers involving sharing at the level of generalized experiences. Further analysis of different states of the bonds and their consequences is drawn from Thomas Scheff's distinction of the social bond as one of three states: attuned, engulfed or isolated. When attuned to fellow sufferers, peer support can be genuinely self-empowering and healing, but also other consequences emerge. In engulfed bonds with fellow sufferers, the particular self stands at risk of being overpowered by others. Isolated bonds with fellow sufferers may not be capable of breaking the lonely state of suffering. This paper provides an elaborate empirical understanding of the interplay between fate, the social and the individual in the context of peer support. The data is made up of repeated in-depth interviews with 22 Finnish women and men that contain narrated life stories, accompanied by information about their network, of significant others and support contacts.

DE haunting; individualization; subjectivity; relationality; psycho-social
   studies; psychoanalysis; racialized belonging; masculinity
AB This paper uses the notion of 'haunting' to explore how even those who might be considered to be particularly individualized are inhabited by the traces of the lives of others. The paper works with a single detailed case study taken from UK based research on the personal lives and values of people living outside the conventional cohabiting couple. It develops a psycho-social-analysis of interviews with Ben, a black English man in his 50s who is a 'strong' case of the individualization of personal life. Ben represents himself as highly self-reliant and self-sufficient, yet his narratives repeatedly return to the central importance of his long dead father; the paper suggests that his interviews, and his subjectivity, are 'haunted' by the ghost of his father. It explores the ways in which conflicted issues of gendered and racialized belonging and identification, and questions of ethical subjectivity, are worked out in relation to his dead father. The paper is informed by psychoanalytic and sociological writing on psychic and socio-cultural processes of haunting, particularly the work of Christopher Bollas and Avery Gordon. It contributes to the re-thinking of sociological theories of individualization, challenging sociology to take seriously a psychoanalytically inspired ontology of relationality, and the impacts of past relationships on subjectivity.

SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE reflexivity; sociability; drinking habits; young adults; diaries
ID NARRATIVES
AB This paper analyses narratives in drinking and pub diaries written by young Finns aged 23-35. Drinking occasions in Finland are highly sociable gatherings in which one is oriented towards intensive interaction with one's friends. Thus, in the diaries the writers also reflect upon their expectations, descriptions and evaluations of these gatherings and the sociability they offer. In the analysis we focus on how during these occasions the writers adapt themselves to the perceived expectations of others, integrate these expectations with their own aspirations, or are sometimes compelled to change their aspirations. On this basis, we also pay attention to how this work of reflexive orientation functions to strengthen the expected course of one's own life, or as implying fateful moments, that is, transitions or turning points in the life course. In the analysis we apply G.H. Mead's concepts of 'I' and 'me'. The paper identifies three different kinds of 'I-me dialogues'. First, loosening oneself momentarily from reflexivity to the collective body of friends; second, binding oneself reflexively to the common will of the group; and third, loosening oneself from group commitments, that is moving towards individual reflexivity and desires. Of these dialogues, the last mentioned contributes most often to fateful activity in which the writers' life course is at stake. By contrast, the other two more collectively oriented self-talks rather refer to positive peak experiences that give emotional momentum to continue with one's existing life plans.

DE youth; qualitative longitudinal; biographical; critical moments
ID TRANSITIONS
AB The idea of epiphanies, turning points and critical biographical moments is a central analytic category of life history research in general, and of youth studies in particular. In this paper we explore how we have engaged with ideas of 'fatefulness' (Giddens 1991) and biographical 'choice' in a longitudinal qualitative study of young people's transitions to adulthood, tracing the employment of theoretical and analytical devices through time to assess their usefulness in this context. We attempted to operationalise Giddens' idea of the fateful moment in relation to biographical data asking how the analysis of a formal narrative device (critical moments, turning points) might play a part in mapping and theorising the configuration of structural conditions, individual responses, timing and chance. We reviewed earlier analyses, and the changes of interpretation brought about by the accumulation of biographical data through time, recognising the provisional nature of interpretation in longitudinal research and analysis. The process of revisiting and revising our deliberations over the meaning and significance of the critical moments within biographical narratives confirms the interpretative value of focussing on these narrative forms, yet suggests that late modern theoretical frameworks with their emphasis on reflexivity may have a limited contribution to make to understanding the configuration of biography and history. We suggest that this makes a theoretical and methodological contribution to biographical and narrative approaches to the study of young people's lives, transitions to adulthood and trajectories.

AB Food safety is a vital concern and a salient regulatory arena, with important implications for consumers, producers and retailers of food. Following the BSE crisis in 1996, and with the alleged aim to restore consumer confidence in food, national and fragmented food safety regulations across Europe were transformed into a new European-wide food regulatory system. This included a new legal and regulatory framework, a new institutional set-up of public authorities, and new roles for public and private actors. The article analyses how the division of responsibilities for food safety has changed both across the EU as a whole and, more specifically, in six European countries. Based on seven case studies, which were prepared as part of a comparative research project, TRUSTINFOOD, the article analyses how core principles of the new EU food safety policy was put into practice in Denmark, Germany, Italy, Norway, Portugal and the UK. The article demonstrates how changes in regulatory practices in EU and the six countries converge with respect to formal regulatory framework and diverge with respect to practical implementation and institutional reform. It is a shared perspective to restore consumer confidence by enhancing institutional independence, transparency and consumer agency, but conditions for this differ between the countries. The structure of food markets and the political agendas around food issues continue to vary in different national contexts but the new food safety policy may further the development of the single European market and thus promote changes within the food production systems in Europe.

The data were collected from a survey given to a sample of 247 females and 223 males from six regions in Turkey. Statistical analysis revealed that gender, education level, and socio-economic status had significant impacts on knowledge, attitudes, and responsible behavior. Participants who were more aware of the impacts of nature made important suggestions at both the national and international level.

AB Social capital has been recognized as one of the most influential concepts in social and political sciences. It is assumed that it has significant influence on several issues such as health status, educational achievement and environmental attitudes. In the present article we attempt to investigate the influence of social capital on the tendency of European citizens to contribute money for the environment using data from EVS 1999/2000. Firstly, an estimation of individual social capital is calculated for European citizens with the use of Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Secondly, the relation between individual social capital and willingness to pay (WTP) is examined. Thirdly, further evidence is provided by introducing in the analysis the influence of other factors such as income, age, gender and educational level. In addition, the influence of contextual factors on WTP is explored. Through the results of the study it is observed that most European citizens are willing to pay for the environment and their decision is influenced significantly from elements of social capital. Furthermore, on a contextual level only some of the factors investigated explain the tendency to contribute money for the environment.

SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE cultural capital; symbolic capital; education; paternalism
AB Through the application of Bourdieu's ideas of culture and cultural capital to a specific city located in Southeastern Turkey, this article identifies the forms of cultural capital, including education and consumption, that became important in class formation since the end of the nineteenth century. The article identifies changes in the historical forms which symbolic and cultural capital have taken. In this city, as non-Western pre-capitalist culture was abandoned, partly due to forced modernization, previous patterns of hierarchies that generated the social groups/relations began to transform. While a nuanced set of practices were distinguishing features of social life, the whole set of practices of generosity, kindness or politeness was filtered through the prism of paternalist domination. From the end of the nineteenth century onwards, however, a symbolic struggle involved questions of taste and culture. Drawing on the struggle between the 'old' and 'new' wealth, this article scrutinises the role of cultural capital in class formation from a historical perspective in relation to family, embodiment and education.

AB Relations between race, nation, class, and gender as categories of social inclusion and exclusion have been subject to contemporary international debates in the social sciences. Critically reflecting upon these debates, this article examines the complex interplay of patterns of discrimination based on race, nation, gender, and class in an international racist campaign in the early 1920s. It was conducted by a wide range of organisations and individuals from different backgrounds in objection to the use of black French colonial troops in the Allied Rhineland occupation. These were denounced as a 'Black Shame', a primitive alien element in 'civilized' Europe. Patterns of inclusion and exclusion referring to the four categories were not strung together in a purely summative way. Gender, race, nation and class presented flexible, interlocking categories, and could even substitute for one another, when the 'Black Shame' was condemned as French aggression against white womanhood, the German nation, European civilisation, and the white race, and used as an ideological call for the cohesion of all Germans and 'Whites'. I focus on the central role of the category gender in the campaign, and argue that campaigners used the German woman figuratively as an embodiment of the German nation and white race, seemingly threatened by desecration. German women, who refused to play this role and had relationships with black soldiers, were socially excluded from both imagined communities - nation and race. The discourse on the 'Black Shame' is an example of the intensive connections of the categories race, nation, gender, and class in modern racism and racist discrimination. My research advocates their conceptually combined and historically reflexive analysis.

AB The relationship between social status and religiosity could be illuminating in the explanation of religiosity. This has been suggested by numerous sociologically minded authors. Although not consistent across all national samples, findings from the current study, based on World Values Survey data (1999-2001), did indicate the predominance of a moderate but positive association between low social status and high religiosity among European countries with a Christian heritage. Consequently, the results lent limited support to the classical deprivation thesis, since in none of the samples analyzed could a positive association between high social status and high religiosity could be found.

ID RIGHTS
AB Beck (2006) has suggested that trans-national migration and the consolidation of human rights are features of an emergent cosmopolitan society in which we see a blurring of distinctions with respect to the rights of citizens and noncitizens. This paper argues that the presence of noncitizens on national territory has rather been accompanied by an expansion of distinctions in a system of civic stratification. It outlines the construction of asylum seekers as a 'target group' within this complex, and the withdrawal of welfare support from 'late claimers'. However, the paper also considers the limits placed on the erosion of rights through the human rights challenge that followed, in which the European Convention on Human Rights played a central role. Finally, the paper elaborates the interplay of formal entitlement and informal status in the process of change, and examines the implications of the whole account for cosmopolitan thinking.

From a methodological point of view, this concept is an invitation to reintroduce in EU studies the comparative approach as well as long-term history. This paper also leads to a detailed reflection on the concept of empire itself and proposes a modernized definition of it. The use of this concept enables to shed a new light on the EU and some of its policies. If the EU cannot be considered an empire, it can nonetheless be said that it is undergoing a process of imperialization. This raises the question of the transformation of the European project and to the consequences of this transformation.

AB Do members of the committees under the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) find that there are coalitions of specific member states in these committees? If so, then what kind of side payments hold these coalitions together? For the first time in scholarly literature, and based on an empirical investigation, the findings in this paper document that two opposing coalitions - with the United Kingdom and France as the respective leaders - exist in OMC committees where mutual learning is the raison d'etre. In the existing theory on this subject in the EU, it is claimed that consensus decision-making leads to a weakening of coalition-building. All three committees analysed in this paper build on consensus decision-making, which is achieved after intensive meetings between all the members. However, it is contended that the 'argumentative contest' working method of the OMC committees leads to more - not less - coalition-building. On the basis of a test, it is also shown that these committees are primarily held together by side payments in the form of 'promises relating to policy among the like-minded'; however, 'payments allied to subsequent decisions' add to the cement of the coalition-building processes stemming from the OMC working method.

AB International and transnational processes pose distinctive challenges to the traditional boundaries and conceptual frameworks of the discipline of social policy. International actors can no longer simply be 'added on' to traditional national studies. Rather, a new vocabulary and epistemology is needed to capture the complexity and liminality of the encounters between actors, sites, discourses, scales and contexts. In this text, based on empirical insights from South East Europe, we interrogate the ways in which various kinds of network-based organisations, and new intermediaries have effectively depoliticised social policy, whilst emphasising the possibilities of a new internationalisation of political struggles and mobilisations.

AB The paper attempts to empirically test skill demand on the Austrian labour market between 1985 and 2005 by making use of job advertisements. We analyze job advertisements covering a time span of 20 years. This allows us to examine whether there is a trend towards increased merit selection. Our empirical research is based on a content analysis of 975 newspaper job advertisements. We expand on the operationalization of education by looking at both educational level and field of study. Results indicate that jobs described in advertisements increasingly demanded various types of skill. Besides educational merits, other types of skills are also relevant in modern-day economies: social and personal skills. It is demonstrated that the driving force in changing demands is not only compositional change (with the expansion of high-skill demanding jobs), but also changes within occupational groups.

AB This paper investigates the impact of gender differences in tertiary education, i.e., field of study and level of tertiary degree, on two selected labour market risks: unemployment and low-status jobs. Using Labour Force Survey data from the year 2000, results of the logistic regression models and non-linear decomposition analyses generally confirm our expectation that the field of study explains a sizable portion of the gender gap in unemployment and low-status jobs in both countries. However, the level of tertiary degree earned explains only part of the female disadvantage behind holding a low-status job in Spain. The analyses also show that compared to men, women with a degree in a predominantly male field of study seem to be systematically disadvantaged in both Germany and Spain, particularly with respect to unemployment. Overall, the analyses reveal that gender differentiation in tertiary education leads to similar outcomes in two very different institutional contexts.

AB Previous research has shown that track mobility during secondary education is influenced by parental background. However, family background effects might vary due to institutional variations in the educational structure. Therefore, in our paper we compare social selectivity of track mobility in two countries, Germany and The Netherlands. Both countries offer a hierarchically tracked educational system, but differ in details. Further, both countries established educational reforms in the late sixties, changing the conditions for track mobility differently. In our empirical analyses using data from the Family Survey Dutch Population and the German Life History Study we find that changing to a higher track is more likely for students who face the threat of status demotion, whereas changing to a lower track is independent of status maintenance motives. Intra-secondary transitions occur less often in The Netherlands than in Germany and are less motivated by status maintenance. Educational legislation reduces the effects of relative education of the parents only on upward mobility in Germany and only on downward mobility in The Netherlands.

AB The post-war settlement rested on confidence that state welfare combined with neo-Keynesian economic management supported economic progress and enhanced social stability. New approaches from the 1970s onwards inspired by monetarism saw extensive state welfare as a damaging economic burden. The welfare settlement that is currently emerging in European debates argues that a welfare state centred on social investment, combined with appropriate de-regulation and use of social benefits to support employment mobility can again contribute to economic and social objectives in a virtuous spiral of growth and justice. In practice, however, most European states have been far more successful in what might broadly be called negative activation (less regulation, restrictions on passive benefits and targeted help for high-risk groups), than in investment to enhance the knowledge base and improve mobility. The differences between the new social investment welfare state and more limited de-regulated welfare system seem to be less marked in practice than the tenor of policy debate implies.

AB The article studies the development of social services in Britain, France and Germany since the 1980s. In this period services grew strongly and were extended to large population groups, although the welfare state was in crisis. Moreover, the power of the state was enhanced. The share of public service provision declined somewhat, but this was more than balanced by increased public funding and intensified state control of delivery. The paper argues that the rise of social services does not signal a 'new' welfare state. Rather, the belated expansion of social services compared to other areas is explained by the fact that services have become crucial for the economy and the labour market only recently. Since this was the case, they have followed the classical path of welfare state expansion.

DE poverty dynamics; social policy; welfare regimes; southern Europe;

ID POLICIES; GREECE; SPAIN; STATE
AB This article aims to assess the extent to which social policies address current and persistent poverty in southern European Union countries in general and Portugal in particular. The southern European welfare regime, which includes Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, has been seen as less developed and less generous in covering social risks. Additionally, the southern European welfare regime presents several inefficiencies that make social policies much less successful in tackling current and persistent poverty. In spite of having recently followed a common path of welfare reforms, southern European countries are far from achieving substantial results in poverty reduction in recent years. Possible explanations of enduring poverty may rest on cultural and institutional factors such as less state accountability in the context where a prominent role in welfare provision rests on families, high levels of tolerance of inequality and poverty, and, in broader terms, in attitudes toward inequality and poverty embedded in social and political practices. In this framework, the case of Portugal is further developed and contrasted with others countries in southern Europe.

AB The main question this paper seeks to tackle is whether men and women, as some argue, commit themselves to employment differently or for different reasons. The focus is thus on the mechanisms behind non-financial employment commitment (such as the possible effect of family situation, occupational position, and of different work-related preferences and experiences). The question is comparatively investigated in Sweden and Great Britain, where, in spite of many similarities, the existence of different societal/cultural contexts with relevance for gender and work has been suggested. The results in this paper suggest that the most important motivator for non-financial employment commitment is interesting work, which was found to have a positive effect both as a work goal and as experienced in the workplace. Although women and men in both countries displayed quite similar patterns, some country and gender differences appeared in the way occupational position and degree of education relate to this type of commitment. Higher occupational position and education where more clearly related to higher degrees of commitment for British women than for British men, while the Swedish gender pattern was reversed. In the concluding discussion, possible explanations and implications are discussed, and avenues for further research are suggested.

SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES

DE care credits; France; gender; Germany; pension norms
AB European pension systems are in the process of change. A general development is the retrenchment of public schemes. In combination with the aim of individualizing pension entitlements, it is crucial that the pension situation of women, and of mothers in particular, be improved. Some European countries attempt to reduce the gender pension gaps with child care credits. This paper takes a closer look at the French and German systems. Can adjustments to the pension norm, in terms of different allowances for child care as introduced in both countries, balance gender pension gaps? Following the logic of the individual factors, the duration of insurance and the level of paid contributions, the main factors are analysed to evaluate the efficiency of care credits. Within the complexity of pension-related factors, adjustments to the originally male pension norms have very ambiguous effects, and they are insufficient to de-gender pension gaps.

AB The article first describes how the European Union has replaced the idea of nationally bounded freedom to move, settle, and work with the idea of free movement for all Europeans and the notion of non-discrimination. The second section gives an analysis of the extent to which citizens of different European countries support the idea of non-discrimination between nationals and European foreigners. The empirical basis for our analysis is the 'European Values Study'. The descriptive findings show that the idea of non-discrimination is not supported by the majority of the European citizens, and that there are substantial differences between the countries. In the third section, we explain these differences by referring, among other factors, to the level of modernization of a country, the value orientation of the respondent, the level of education of the respondent, and the unemployment rate.

ID EUROPE
AB This paper takes its starting point in the public discourse, of politicians and academics, that suggests that Europe, specifically the European Union, is suffering from a 'crisis of identity'. This is believed to stem from the recent enlargements, the pending 'problem of Turkey', and disarray over the European Constitution. This issue is addressed in two ways: first, through an exploration of the main current models and meanings of 'Europe', and second, applying an anthropological approach to identity, through examining the relationship between models and meanings of 'Europe' and local, regional, ethnic and national identities. In the first place, this suggests that there is not, and cannot be, agreement over the shape and meaning of 'Europe'. There is, rather, rooted in histories, geographies, politics, and cultures, a range of different Europes, which only coincide imperfectly, at best. In the second place, Europe is always viewed from local, regional, ethnic and national points of view. Each approach converges on the same conclusion: there can never be a clear-cut, consensual unified model of Europe. This is a normal situation, not a crisis, and, if anything, is one of the strengths of the European Union project.

ID STATE
AB As 'Eurobarometer' surveys indicate, European populations are increasingly sceptical about further EU enlargement, especially as far as Turkey is concerned. Austria's rejection of negotiations with Turkey has been remarkable. While the Austrian government has been in line with European council resolutions, policy makers of different parties have reiterated their claim for alternatives to full membership for Turkey. Furthermore, opinion polls have shown that the Austrian population's refusal of Turkey is above EU average. Embedded in the popular arguments why Turkey should stay outside the EU, we find what Ralf Grillo has called 'cultural anxiety': essentialist views of 'our' and 'their' culture cause fears about a fast growing and predominantly Muslim population that would flow into EU labour markets and threaten 'us', in particular 'our' democracy, equality and human rights. Against this backdrop my interest will neither be focused on a further analysis of whether Turkey is sufficiently prepared for EU accession nor on the European Union's absorption capacity. In this paper I will rather focus on the emergence of hegemonic and counter-hegemonic cultural practices of selfing and othering in order to better understand the extensive refusal of Turkey's EU accession in Austria.

DE migration; intra-EU mobility; European integration
AB The first part of this paper describes the small but constant expansion of the cross-state mobile population within the EU in the two decades preceding the 2004 enlargement. This expansion is puzzling in the light of the economic growth and the income convergence of member states over the same period. While the level of geographical mobility within the EU is frequently held to be 'low', data show that it should have been even lower given the rise of prosperity and the decline of income differentials in the EU15. In fact, it is argued that pro-mobility policies and the rise of non-labour migration have countered the diminishing appeal of intra-EU mobility that might be expected on the basis of purely economic conditions. The second part of the paper discusses the rationales and reasons of mobility. A distinction is drawn between observers' and social actors' views of the benefits of free movement. While the former usually put an emphasis on economic rewards, the latter are more likely to stress emotional and identity-linked returns. Survey data on Western European citizens who have resettled in another EU member state are revealing of the multifaceted causes and consequences of geographical mobility. In particular, these data show that identification with Europe and support for EU institutions in the mobile population are strikingly higher than among the general population. While it is true that cross-state mobility can entail economic benefits raising productivity and innovation, its political dividends are possibly even clearer.

AB This article considers the role of European Union (EU) cultural policy within the process of Europeanization. It will trace the development of EU competence on cultural matters in general, and of the flagship programme 'European City of Culture' in particular. The latter will be observed both in its overall implementation and in the exceptional edition of 2000, when in order to celebrate the millennium nine cities shared the title, allegedly bringing the European reconfiguration of space into full light. This will show that the minutiae of cultural policy-making are never far removed from far-reaching discourses on European identity. How the gap is overcome, rhetorically and practically, provides the strategic vantage point for analyzing how the creation of a 'European cultural space' may be suggesting new ways to think of spatiality in its connection to culture and identity formation.

AB This paper seeks to disentangle analytically the trends towards the subsidiarization of social policies in Europe addressing how the social policy reforms changed actors' governance arrangements and altered the government scales involved over the last few decades. Following an introductory analysis of the main causes of the subsidiarization of social policies (sections 1 and 2), attention is devoted to the differences between welfare systems in Europe (section 3) and the way they influence the directions of change. The hypothesis is that, despite the fact that the subsidiarization of social policies is a converging rhetoric in most European countries' social policy reforms, the impact of the process varies according to the specificities of the respective regulatory frames at the national or sub-national scales. This is exemplified in the final part of the paper (section 4) which considers the Italian case and the main critical dimensions that emerge through these processes.

AB Despite embracing the rhetoric of transnational flows and networks, comparative research on media content continues to fall prey to methodological nationalism. When it comes to empirical measurement, researchers often, despite their best intentions, fall back on techniques that assume that the discourses circulating within particular nationally bounded communicative spaces are homogenous. In this article, we developed a set of propositions and analytical approaches that should help to overcome this impasse, and used them to examine the newspaper debates on the EU Constitutional Treaty in seven European states: the Czech Republic, Germany, France, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Switzerland, and the UK. We suggested that instead of focusing solely on comparisons between nationally bounded communicative spheres, we should also look at differences between class-related communicative spaces. By adopting such an approach, we can acknowledge both sub-national segmentations of communicative spaces and transnational linkages, while at the same time not losing sight of the importance of the national. The results support our initial contention that the research on European mass communication ought to move beyond comparisons between national units and the levels of their respective Europeanization, and examine how European issues are conveyed in media catering to different social classes.

AB This article analyses the personal spatiality of people with different economic and cultural backgrounds, using Estonia as an example of a 'new' EU country and Sweden as an example of an 'old' one. On the basis of survey data, the contacts, interest and feeling of cultural closeness of different cultures and the connections of these with socio-demographic variables, societal trust, and regional identities are analysed. The results show that personal spatiality is spread homogeneously over social groups in Sweden. In Estonia, personal spatiality differentiates socio-demographic groups and is related to general social trust. The society is separated into a personally 'globalised' group and a group that feels uncertainty in connection with EU enlargement and globalisation. In the new member states of the EU, cultural adaptation without overcoming transition trauma may cause cultural isolation, even xenophobia. Avoiding resistance against transcultural communication patterns contributes to the development of common values and interregional economic cooperation between EU member states.

TI The changing shape of class voting - An individual-level analysis of
   party support in Britain, Germany and Switzerland
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES

ID STRATIFICATION; TRANSFORMATION; EMPLOYMENT; COUNTRIES; EVOLUTION; FRANCE
AB In the 1990s, sociologists engaged in a heated controversy about class voting. Although empirical evidence accumulated, positions remained surprisingly divided. This paper argues that this disagreement is due to two factors. Firstly, it reflects diverging understandings as to the concept of class voting. Secondly, it is explained by the use of class models that do not satisfactorily represent today's social stratification in Western Europe. In consequence, this paper uses a detailed multi-class schema and examines two cleavages running through the social structure: (i) the economic divide separating holders of organizational power from the workingclass, (ii) the cultural divide opposing high-skilled classes engaged in interpersonal work settings (who hold a liberation view of community) from low-skilled classes occupied in object-related tasks (who hold an authoritarian view of community). Based on individual level data, our analyses show that classes continue to systematically differ in their party support. There is strong electoral evidence for the traditional economic cleavage in Britain's and Germany's class structure, while in Switzerland the cultural cleavage seems more salient. Hence, class voting continues but appears to involve more (and different) class-party alliances than just leftvoting by the woking class. Among others, we find salaried professionals in the social and cultural services to rally the libertarian left, while managers support parties on the right. Moreover, where a right-wing populist party alternative exists, it attracts disproportionate support from production workers and small business owners.

TI Party politics in Portugal - Municipalities and central government
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES

DT Article
DE mayors; members of parliament; independent candidacies; parties
AB Since the Portuguese revolution of April 25th, 1974, and the beginning of the democratic regime (with the first elections for parliament held on April 25th, 1975), political parties dominate the electoral process, both on central government and on the municipalities. The analysis of the political elites, their party filiations and recruitment and their social backgrounds has occupied Portuguese social scientists for the last years. With this paper, the author proposes to establish the relationship between these two levels of government, national and local, and access the importance of political parties in each of them. Many mayors' political careers include vertical mobility, both upwards and downwards: from mayors to members of parliament to members of the European Parliament and ministers or even Prime Minister and President of the Republic (in the case of two mayors of Lisbon), or from ministers and members of parliament to mayors. In all of these cases, their party and their position within the party has played a central role, even when some individuals have pursued other party choices in order to get re-elected, or even have presented independent candidacies (only possible since 1997).

AB In this study contradictory hypotheses are tested about the changing income advantages of Communist Party (CP) members derived from the Elite Circulation Thesis and the Elite Reproduction Thesis, using cross-sectional datasets from before and during the transformation process. CP members are matched with non-CP members on several important income determinants such as human capital, occupational class, market capital, age, gender, and marital status. Independent-samples t-tests, on differences in mean personal (ln)income reveal that CP members earn more than non-CP members do before and during the transformation process. An ANOVA shows that the income advantages of CP members are most persistent in the Czech Republic and Russia while they get smaller in Slovakia and Hungary. Comparing the four countries suggests that the remaining income advantages of CP members may partly be explained by transformation specific differences between countries.

AB This study delineates a scheme for examining Bourdieu's theory which relates social structure and cultural consumption (the homology thesis). Interpreting homology as the exclusive mapping between the space of cultural consumptions and social structure e.g., 'high' art as the exclusive domain of the upper class, is inadequate. Bourdieu's theory allows a more refined scheme which incorporates habitus. I elaborate this scheme and derive some propositions regarding the pattern of music consumptions and social structure. A Multiple Indicator Multiple Cause model is used to examine the homology thesis directly; where in the measurement part, a latent class model is used to derive types of consumers (or space of cultural consumption), and simultaneously, in the structural part, a logistic model is used to estimate stratification effects of being in one of the types. Using survey data sponsored by Arts Council England, it is shown that the space of music consumptions is inhabited by two types of music consumers: the popular and the dominant class. Furthermore, this space is shown to be structured by social class thereby lending some support to the homology thesis.

AB This paper provides an overview of the main ongoing employment changes taking place in Portugal and particular emphasis is given to the information and communication technologies (ICT) sector. However, due to its heterogeneous composition, both intensive and low-knowledge services are addressed in this sector, ranging from ICT companies in general to call centres in particular. Starting with a brief revision of both optimistic and critical approaches to the new service-based economy, the paper seeks to contribute to this theoretical debate through the analysis of a very singular context, the Portuguese one, based on the results of a research project. The main argument points out that employment changes in the ICT sector are associated with labour segmentation and growing differences in work and employment conditions, including gender inequalities.

AB In this article, we evaluate the effect of both formal and informal childcare support systems on the post-divorce labour supply of divorced mothers. To this end, we model the change in working hours before and after divorce by using a multilevel approach, estimating the impact of both micro- and macro-level determinants. Although we find empirical evidence for the hypothesis that a country's institutional environment plays an important role in facilitating employment as a strategy for mothers to cope with their financial losses following partnership dissolution, our conclusion is that the change in labour supply is more responsive to the whole of a country's family policies rather than to so-called 'domain-specific' indicators of formal and informal childcare provision. Furthermore, our empirical evidence suggests that at the micro-level, formal and informal childcare strategies are connected. The complementary role of informal support systems, facilitating the use of formal childcare, is an important finding from a policy point of view. However, further research will have to make clear which conditions have to be fulfilled in order to help divorced mothers to combine work and care, thus enabling them to mitigate the economic consequences of partnership dissolution.

AB It has often been argued that Southern European countries are more familialistic in their culture than Western and Northern European countries. In this paper, we examine this notion by testing the hypothesis that adult children are more responsive to the needs of their elderly parents in countries with more familialistic attitudes. To test this hypothesis, we analyse the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). We focus on three indicators of need: (a) the partner status of the parent, (b) the health status of the parent, and (c) the education of the parent. Using Heckman probit models, we examine the effects of these variables on whether or not the parent receives instrumental support from children, thereby controlling for whether or not children live independently from their parents. We estimate effects of need on support and we compare these effects across 10 European countries, using both graphic devices and a multilevel probit model where individuals are nested in countries. We find significant cross-level interactions of need variables and the degree of familialism in a country. Our analyses, thereby provide more positive evidence for the hypothesis than earlier studies, which have focused largely on comparing aggregate levels of support among countries.

The problem does not only stem from the still-living legacies of the past. It stems also from the EU need to provide EU governance with EU-oriented learned professionals in order to come to terms with the rising multidisciplinary complexity of EU decision-making and manage the challenges of current social, political and economic mainstreams. The paper deals with the above issues by focusing on the recent EU quest for expertising EU governance and governing professional EU expertise in a number of evolutionary stages: EU professional and higher education law-policy making; EU reaction towards the so-called 'globalization wave' as regards EU epistemic communities; EU 'learning economy' and 'Bologna Convention' models; the impact of the Nice Treaty on the re-assessment of European professional realms. The need for a European sociology of European professions is stressed in conclusion.

TI European regulation of professional education - A study of documents

SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES

ID STATES
AB National governing and regulation of professions is to some extent challenged by contemporary international regulation, and partly replaced by considerable international re-regulation - firstly by the European Union, and secondly by globalization of the markets for capital, goods, services and labour. Issues regarding professions are being negotiated at the European level by European professional federations and EU public authorities. These new trends raise questions for the sociological analysis of professions regarding standards of professional education, forms of public regulation, strategies of market closure or autonomy. This paper is a summary of the policies for and the formal regulation of professional education in the European Union. Data are based on policy documents, directives and agreements with a particular focus on the cases of architects and psychologists. Psychology demonstrates most elements of a professional project, proactively emphasizing education, research and academic status and new tasks on an international market. Architecture demonstrates a more established occupation defending the market and emphasizing the social status and the ubiquitous and general role of architecture. There has been a shift from 'hard' regulation to more 'soft' regulation, allowing more room for professional actors to organise themselves and define their rules of mobility, as well as more initiatives from below and within national and supranational associations, making the policies more contextually determined compared to the external directions from above in the 1980s.

ID LEMONS
AB The paper provides an analysis of the major controversy which occurred between national aviation authorities during their work on the European harmonization of the aircraft technicians' competence. The debate focused on the institutional method to assure the high skills level required for that profession: should Europe introduce a system of personnel licensing or a system of company-led training? Should competence assurance and monitoring be assigned to the aviation authority or should these responsibilities be delegated to approved companies? A series of 20 extensive interviews with aviation stakeholders in France, Germany and the United Kingdom showed: (i) the company training option highlights the fact that 'organization' is a traditional strategy for competence assurance in high-reliability contexts (like aircraft maintenance), the other main alternatives being occupational regulation and sorting by well-informed markets. (ii) The quality recognition required for the international outsourcing of safety-critical services favours the licensing system. In contrast to licensing, the design of the company training system fails to generate the transparency and trust necessary to reassure foreign customers. (iii) Both systems of competence assurance are densely intertwined with specific industrial relation patterns and vested interests. The distortion of these - national or local - equilibriums by European harmonization encounters strong opposition from the industry and/or unions.

DE healthcare; governance; medical profession; European convergence
ID EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE
AB The building of a European nation challenges entrenched ties between the state and the professions. Yet, in relation to healthcare, European law is especially weak and professional power is particularly strong. Against this background, the present paper aims to map out the specific configurations of the changing governance of healthcare and the dynamics arising from intersecting contexts of change. We argue that the 'healthcare state' is strongly shaped by national regulatory frameworks, while the platform for the power of a self-regulatory medical profession is increasingly international in nature. Across countries managerialism and performance measures together with evidence-based medicine and clinical guidelines are meant to improve the accountability of professionals and the safety of the public. However, the new regulatory tools may also have the opposite effect and indeed serve as a means to reassert professional power; here, the heightened internationalization of healthcare even provides new opportunities. We use material from different countries gathered in a number of research projects to assess the changing governance of healthcare and its contexts. The paper concludes by highlighting the significance of both national regulatory frameworks and (international) professionalism.

DE cultural professions; copyright law; EU-Directive; knowledge-society;

AB European continental countries traditionally emphasized the character of the cultural possessions as a public good. Now the technological development, accelerated expansion, internationalization, and the commercialization of the cultural economy bear a new quality of contradiction between social and economic demands in the field of cultural work. This problem is discussed with regard to the framework for freelance work in cultural professions in Germany. The main focus is on the specific institutional arrangement, which supports professionalism in the field of culture, without providing a privileged status comparable to the established professions. One central column of this arrangement is the German copy right law, which defines - in contrast to the Anglo-Saxon model, created as an investment protection - an individual property right of 'intellectual property' ('Geistiges Eigentum'), against misuse, and economic exploitation. Against the background of the structural changes in the media in the 1990s, the EU is supporting the reform of copyright regulations in the European member states. It is claimed that present EU directions, developed within the concept of a 'European knowledge-society', break with the leading concept of cultural professions, but without providing a consistent foundation to solve the societal challenges of present culture and media production.

SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES

DT Article
DE professional markets; European and state regulations; policy networks;
   professional representation; trade-unions; collective action; architects
AB This paper is devoted to the regulation of architectural activity in Europe and especially in France and to the ways architects manage this regulation. The globalization of this activity has generated a strong consciousness that supranational regulation is necessary, both among architects' professional associations and in governments. One of the main difficulties is the differences in the division of labour from one country to another. But European regulation supposes that national states will implement the directives into national law. France is an example of the lightest possible adaptation. This is all the more surprising as the architectural profession in France is characterized by structural weaknesses to resist international competition and as the administration is willing to help it adapt to this competition. The history of trade unionism and the structure of representation explain some of the difficulties because of a particular trait of the architectural profession: what I call a weak 'reflective capacity'. The paper is partly devoted to defining this notion and showing its relevance for the sociological analysis of professions. This weakness encourages individual strategies of adaptation to increasing international competition, without the professional associations and their representatives being able to control these strategies and their consequences for the profession. This demonstrates that the various sources of regulation are not exclusive and must be studied together so as to understand their interrelations.

AB The increase in unemployment that occurred in France at the end of the 1970s is one aspect that has favoured the creation of jobs specializing in the field of social welfare for the unemployed. This paper focuses on the analysis of the professional group of advisers specializing in job seeking. The first section traces the circumstances of the emergence of such a group and explains the heterogeneity of these advisers who seem, nevertheless, to have developed a specific common expertise and the same interpretation of their professionalism. In the second part, the activity of these professionals is situated in the larger framework of unemployed policies which result from a combination of international, European and national influences. The study of recent changes to unemployment policies reveals the effects of the 'macro' on the 'micro' level. In the third section, it is explained that new measures of social welfare for the unemployed tend to challenge the moral and deontological principles of these advisers whose professional identity and professionalism are challenged. These challenges to their identities are due to the intensification of the follow-up of the unemployed and to the application of bureaucratic, monitoring and measurement techniques and logic to assess the efficiency of the tools for promoting a quick return to work.

AB The paper examines some of the ways in which the problematic of activation is put into play in the European Employment Strategy (EES) and Danish employment policies. The limitations of causal analysis and convergence approaches are discussed and a different analytical framework based on the concept of normalization is proposed. It is argued that while various forms of activation were present in Denmark well before the launching of the EES in 1997/1998, the latter has contributed to the normalization of the Danish employment policies by sustaining activation as the key element of such policies and by disregarding political interventions based on alternative problematizations of labour and well-being.

AB Italy has one of the highest incidences of long-term unemployment among OECD countries. The share of first-time jobseekers among the long-term unemployed is outstanding compared to that of the unemployed who have lost a job. Using data from the Italian Household Panel survey and event history analysis, this paper investigates the impact of individual, familial and institutional factors on the duration of unemployment spells of Italian first-time jobseekers and those unemployed who have lost their job, and assesses the issue of duration dependence. Findings emphasise the importance from a policy perspective of analysing these two unemployment experiences separately. The two unemployed groups undergo very different processes of exiting unemployment due to some specific institutional and structural features of the Italian socio-economic context. Results indicate that in Italy the chances of finding a first job decrease with time, and education proves to be effective only after long job searches. On the contrary, among Italian adult unemployed the probability of finding a new job largely depends on individual and familial characteristics rather than on mechanisms associated to the length of time spent unemployed.

AB Working fewer than full-time hours has been seen as a crucial way in which women workers can balance demands from home and paid work. But working part-time holds a range of negative repercussions for other aspects of worker's lives, in particular their economic well-being. Examining objective and subjective indicators of economic well-being, the paper uses data from the European Community Household Panel Survey to consider the ramifications of working short hours for women in Europe. The paper is concerned with the generalisability of the very weak situation of part-timers in Britain. It asks whether and how the economic problems faced by women at the bottom of the occupational hierarchy differ according to societal context. The papers shows that part-time low level workers had the lowest monthly wages relative to their compatriots in each country examined, though the intensity of wage disadvantage varied substantially across the sample. The research did not uncover a universal positive correlation between women's relative wage positions and individual level measures of economic well-being, however. The most prevalent association between working part-time in a low level occupation and facing a weak economic position occurred at the level of household economies. The paper concludes by asking how we best research economic well-being, including whether it should be approached via an individual or household level analysis.

AB This article contributes to the search for explanations of the cross-national variation in fertility rates by studying the influence of social policy, economic and cultural factors on fertility in the former EU15, while giving special attention to one case: The Netherlands. This country lacks good social policy for supporting parents to combine work and care and nevertheless has a relatively high fertility rate. This article addresses the backgrounds of that phenomenon, using comparative macro level data from several sources, such as 'the child benefit package', the European Values Studies, OECD and Eurostat. We argue that bivariate relationships cannot explain cross-national variation in fertility rates. Therefore, we analyse configurations of factors, which shows among others that high availability of part-time jobs for women constitutes only part of the explanation for the Dutch fertility level. Good economic prospects and high male wages in combination with relatively low female human capital make that Dutch families can afford children at their own costs when men work full-time and women work part-time. Therefore, the low level of social policy that supports parents in the indirect or direct costs of children does not result in low fertility rates.

AB The market-enhancing regulations of the European Union (EU) place political and economic constraints on the Member States. This has been expected to induce convergence of social policies, generally in a downward direction. At the same time the notion of a European Social Model has been launched as a strategy to make marketization socially acceptable, pointing to a development in a different direction. This paper examines key aspects of the development of the main social insurance programs during the period 1980-2000 in 14 EU Member States. Are there significant signs of convergence in the replacement rates of social insurance programs and do broader development trends of the social insurance systems indicate converging institutional models? The results indicate divergence rather than convergence of social insurance replacement rates. In terms of institutional models there is no evidence of a common European Social Model in the area of social insurance over the past decades.

AB After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, surveillance pressure on immigrants increased considerably. The trend was the globalization of surveillance of the world population but especially of immigrants. 9/11 was not a turning point, however, since surveillance was already headed towards being globalized. The post-9/11 context accelerated this process. The economic and political developments that have taken place after 9/11 demonstrate that the processes of globalization, immigration and surveillance are closely linked. Today, immigrants from Turkey in Germany experience surveillance within this context. The regulations of the European Union, the policies of the German government and global political-economic processes play interdependent roles in this surveillance which is now more intensified, focused, arbitrary and widespread. Those groups who are economically, religiously, politically, and culturally marginalized are the primary targets of surveillance. The case of immigrants from Turkey can be used to exemplify the surveillance of immigrants in advanced capitalist countries.

AB By comparing the US environmental justice movement with recent European developments, this paper suggests an environmental justice framework which is based on the idea of environmental justice as a heterogeneous process rather than an analytical or normative category. Using major debates on environmental justice particularly in the UK and Germany as a touchstone, eight dimensions of environmental justice are carved out and integrated into a processual model. It is discussed how environmental justice as a process may become robust enough to integrate and react to changing natural and social conditions.

TI Solidarity within Europe/solidarity without Europe
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE society; humanity; Europe; 'rest of the world'; global; political
AB Both in EU policy discourse and in theoretical interventions on Europe, a dilemma was constructed, which has remained implicit. The dilemma in question concerns on the one hand, European solidarity, that is, solidarity within Europe and, on the other hand, solidarity of Europe with 'the rest of the world'. It is posed in the usual either/or form: either Europe creates and strengthens its social solidarity ( its society) or it creates and strengthens its human solidarity ( or solidarity in the name of humanity or humanity); it cannot do both. The dilemma is the wrong way of putting the issue, since it is not only based on an asymmetry between the specificity of 'social' Europe and the indeterminacy of 'the rest of the world' but it also separates Europe's colonial history from the relevant present. The two solidarities need to be brought back together, both for conceptual and for pragmatic reasons.

ID DIALOGICAL SELF; MOVING CULTURES
AB Through the adoption of a dialogical, self + other model, which can appreciate the presence of different discourses and cultures within the self, I have investigated the identities of young migrants. A sample of young Europeans participated in the research, narrating their migration stories with a variety of autobiographical methods which integrated interviews with diaries and visual media. Young migrants refer to their condition as foreigners as an ambivalent one, which, involving also much suffering, oscillates between two different ways of positioning the self. A dream of return is always dominant for the outcasts, who either feel at the margins or do not wish to immerse themselves any deeper in the society they have moved into. Migrating means instead reaching a different level of experience and knowledge of the world to the outsiders, who can successfully translate the detachment of their special positioning into a creative and hybrid reconstruction of identities.

TI 'On par'? The role of the au pair in Switzerland and France
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES

DT Article
DE au pair; role; interaction; spousal relationships; caregiver
ID CHILDREN
AB The role of the au pair as outlined in the 1969 Council of Europe's European Agreement on 'Au Pair' Placement is ambiguous. Although they provide child care for pay, au pairs are supposed to be treated as members of the host family. Based on in-depth interviews with au pairs in Switzerland and France, this paper examines how au pairs define their role. Results show how au pairs' definitions of their roles vary and are constructed through interactions within the host family. The au pair's definition of her role is constructed through work and non-work dyadic interactions with the host mother. The relationship between mother and the au pair does not happen in isolation, however but is shaped by the intimate relationship between the host mother and host father. The triadic relationship between the au pair, host mother, and host father further shapes how the au pair defines and experiences her role.

AB The paper reports a representative study of inhabitants ( age > 13) of the common border regions of Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic. Based on Stephan and Stephan's integrated threat theory three hypotheses are tested, namely that ( 1) the experience of threat due to the EU enlargement leads to a higher prevalence of nationalist attitudes, that ( 2) positive intercultural attitudes lower the impact of enlargement-related threat on nationalism, and that ( 3) the impact of a threat experience on nationalism will be most pronounced in a border region where status differences and repercussions of historic conflicts are most salient, namely the region where the Czech Republic borders on West Germany ( Bavaria). Findings support the first hypothesis. Hypothesis 2 finds little support, while Hypothesis 3 is largely supported. In the Western Czech/Bavarian border region the most imminent conflict potential exists; only there the hypothesis of a mediation effect of positive interpersonal attitudes finds partial support.

AB The Albanian case represents the most spectacular instance of East-West migration after the dismantling of the Iron Curtain. This paper examines the ways in which Albanians have been able to access employment in Greece and analyzes the processes through which the exclusion of Albanians in employment has occurred. In doing so, we acknowledge the multi-dimensionality of the concept and we look at what kind of inclusion different groups and individuals of Albanian origin achieve in the Greek society and why some migrants do better than others. We will identify three groups of migrants: those who have no contact with any networks of support, are unable to find a job and are in need of help; those who are at risk, fragile in economic terms, without access to social provisions or benefits; and finally those who after regularization have a relatively stable job, and access to social provisions and benefits.

DE poverty; income; income comparisons; Europe; nation state; regions
AB In this paper three methods of relativizations are used: ( 1) we apply the conventional poverty approach: the poor are those whose income remains below 60 percent of the national equivalent disposable income, ( 2) we collapse nations together into one data pool and calculate a poverty line for the EU, and ( 3) we decompose nation states into smaller units representing the poorest and richest areas. Within-nation differences seem to be more pronounced than differences between nations. In the Nordic countries incomes between regions as well as between individuals are more evenly distributed and, consequently, the national means are more representative for the whole countries. Moreover, the Nordic cluster, together with central Europe, is robust against the method of comparison. The method affects the Mediterranean countries. The use of the European poverty line leads to poverty rates two to three times higher than analyses based on national data. The regional variation in these countries is the widest. For this reason, conclusions based on national means may be misleading and national means obscure more than they reveal. In societies with large socio-economic and regional variation in income, and consequently in consumption capacities, purchasing power parities implicitly assuming homogeneous consumption patterns over society may give a distorted picture of the price levels in the country in question.

AB In this paper we consider the consequences for measurement of material deprivation, consistent poverty and economic vulnerability of the shift from the ECHP data set to the EU-SILC instrument. Despite the restricted number of deprivation items available in EU-SILC, we show that there is a substantial overlap between such measures when they are estimated using EU-wide and a set of Irish specific indicators. By placing the EU-wide measures in the context of the full range of Irish indicators, we demonstrate that they allow us to identify clusters of individuals sharply differentiated in terms of their multidimensional deprivation profiles. They also provide an understanding of the socio-economic factors associated with such differentiation that departs in only modest respects from that derived from the more comprehensive set of Irish specific indicators.

SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE child poverty; ethnic minority groups; employment; UK policy
ID SELF-EMPLOYMENT; LABOR-MARKET; BRITAIN; MINORITIES
AB In 1999, the British Government stated its resolve to end child poverty within a generation. In doing so it recognised both the extent of child poverty in the UK and the moral imperative to do something about it. At around the same time, a government study of ethnic minority employment was undertaken, which was to lead to the establishment of the cross-departmental ethnic minority employment task force (EMETF) and a Public Services Agreement target for the Department for Work and Pensions on closing the ethnic minority employment gap. Despite apparent overlaps between these two agendas, given that many minority ethnic group families have children, and worklessness is one of the main causes of child poverty ( though by no means the sole one), they were not really integrated. Nor has integration between them been seen - or encouraged - in European reporting processes covering topics linked to social inclusion and exclusion. In 2006, however, a link was made when the EMETF asked for a paper on child poverty to form the background to its work. This article builds on that initial link, discussing the intersection between child poverty and ethnic minority unemployment policy by illustrating the extent of child poverty as ethnically differentiated and exploring the ways in which it is related to aspects of employment. It goes on to consider the policy implications for both employment policy and income maintenance policy more generally, before examining the obstacles to an integrated approach both in terms of knowledge/understanding and the ways in which the two policy areas are conceived.

SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES

ID SERVICES; LABOR
AB Currently, deregulation of social welfare provision is underway throughout Western Europe. The major tendency is for disorganisation, together with the emergence of welfare markets. This is also changing the way elderly people are provided with personal and socio-medical services. Focusing on domiciliary eldercare, the paper explores if this is accompanied by a change in what Kohli has termed the moral economy of old age welfare. Departing from a general reflection on the organisation of social services in modern welfare capitalism the paper sketches evolutions in the eldercare system of three major European countries, with a special focus on the role of civic rationales and professional norms in the organisational field under consideration. It is argued that the moral economy of eldercare has become fluid, thus implying a broader transformation in the societal treatment of old age.

SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES

DT Article
DE Lisbon process; knowledge-based economies; benchmarking; accountability;

AB The EU faces a number of major challenges: to shift its support from the industries of the past to the knowledge-based industries of the future; to rescue the Lisbon strategy, designed to build a knowledge-based economy but so far achieving little; to re-engage with the European public after the difficulties with the Constitution. The paper argues that these challenges are intimately connected and that it is only by addressing them together that there is any hope for success. It elaborates these connections with particular reference to a reinvigorated Lisbon strategy with a strong social dimension. It concludes by delineating the corresponding challenge that faces the research community: to undertake a fundamental revision of its analysis of social policy in relation to modern economies; and to build a new toolkit for intelligent benchmarking.

TI The Norwegian field of power anno 2000
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES

DT Article
AB This article, in the line of Bourdieu ( 1989), belongs to the research domain about elites and the field of power. Using data from the Norwegian Power & Democracy survey on elites, conducted in 2000, it specifically seeks to uncover the main dimensions and fractions in the Norwegian field of power. Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) has been used to address this issue. The three main findings are these: firstly, our results show that the three most important principal dimensions in the field are an economic capital axis, then an educational and social capital axis, and then an axis separating the judicial positions from positions in culture, organizations and politics. Secondly, the political positions are the most accessible. Thirdly, the public judicial group is the most homogeneous.

ID EUROPEAN-UNION
AB The article highlights activities and findings of the Belgian initiative regarding gender budgeting, which are put against the background of theory and practice developed so far elsewhere. Attention is drawn upon the opportunities of gender budgeting to push further forward the policy goals of gender equality, thereby overcoming a number of problems commonly associated with the currently widely propagated strategy of gender mainstreaming. The article provides first-hand information on the origin of the Belgian initiative, its political location, the activities performed and the methodology used. Analysis of findings addresses a number of key dimensions in gender budgeting, including (i) the overarching importance of the political location, (ii) the internal management and monitoring function of gender budgeting and the importance of prevailing budgetary systems, and (iii) the external accountability function of gender budgeting and the need to link up with outside-government initiatives.

ID SOCIAL-POLICY; EUROPEANIZATION; STATE; WORK
AB This paper looks at childcare provision in Spain from the perspective of policies for the reconciliation of work and family life. The goal is to understand how social care - and childcare in particular - has been placed within the different policy domains of the welfare state, and how this condition affects its opportunities for policy development and innovation. As a point of reference, the study takes into consideration the recent EU benchmark regarding childcare provision in the context of the European Employment Strategy. The investigation looks at the impact of the institutional configuration of the welfare system and the labour market on the development of childcare provision and policies for the reconciliation of work and family. The paper suggests that, given a strong policy legacy in family policy and social services, childcare provision is expanding under the decentralized education system although it has not been articulated in terms of policies for the reconciliation of work and family life, which impacts on female employment. Legislative changes improving the conditions of female employees who give birth have recently been introduced in labour law, although the structure of the labour market and practices in employment relations pose obstacles to their effective implementation.

   biography
AB The Dutch government attempts to base its social policy on a life course perspective, and it promotes such a perspective in Europe. This has led to the introduction of a Life Course Saving Scheme ( starting in 2006), which aims to enable good management of the 'peak hour' of life and to facilitate transitions between and combinations of the activities of working, caring and learning. This important and ambitious policy can be seen as a pioneering example for European countries, however, the present realisation is not sufficient according to research and problems to deal with. This article examines ( 1) whether the Dutch government's life course policy is based on a sound scientific basis and ( 2) whether the new Life Course Saving Scheme can realise the policy aims as formulated.

AB Research about fertility has focused in the main on studying separately the influence of communication networks and social capital on reproductive behavior, but it has rarely tried to integrate both network properties theoretically or analytically. We therefore discuss a general model of purposeful behavior that perceives individuals' subjective perceptions of the utilities of different courses of action to be affected by structures of interpersonal influence. Resources needed to realize desired goals are furthermore shaped by exchange relationships that build social capital. These considerations are empirically applied to explanations of the intentions of 758 Polish men and women ever to have a first, second, or third child. Personal networks are especially relevant for the considerations to have a first or second child. The intentions of childless respondents are positively influenced by network partners who are at a similar stage of their reproductive biographies or who have already taken the step of having a first child. However, respondents with one child have a higher probability of intending to have a second child the more they have access to fertility-related social capital.

DE social capital; hiring process; immigrants
ID STATUS ATTAINMENT; LABOR-FORCE; OCCUPATIONS; RESOURCES
AB This paper studies the role of social capital in the status attainment process and examines the link between the hiring process and the potential pool of social capital embedded in a person's network. The analysis is based on a sample of people newly employed by the municipal services in Malmo, the third largest city in Sweden. Jobs in this sector of labour market are mainly low-paid, and are dominated by women and immigrants. The position generator method is used to measure social capital, understood as assets captured by individuals in social networks. The findings demonstrate that access to social capital is positively related to work experience, a higher educational level, having a partner, and active membership of voluntary associations. It is also apparent that being an immigrant is associated with a substantial social capital deficit. Regarding the return on capital, the results show that both human capital and social capital were rewarded with higher wages and more adequate jobs. Furthermore, we found that social capital is associated with better labour market outcomes, whether or not respondents reported that they obtained their current jobs using informal job-search methods. Results also show similar returns on access to social capital for natives and immigrants.

AB Traditionally, employee control has been considered a buffer against stress, but debate about the transformation of work raises new questions. Can individual control really counteract the high demands in downsized organisations? Or does it make flexible work even more difficult to define and delimit, physically and emotionally? This article, based on survey data from 800 Swedish employees, studies the effect of job control on work hours, work-family conflict and psychological wellbeing. The results show that high job demands are associated with longer work hours, more work-family conflict and lower wellbeing, while control has positive effects, even when demands are high.

AB In this paper we analyse the health effects of fixed-term contract status for men and women in West-Germany and Spain using panel data. This paper asks whether changes in the employment relationship, as a result of the liberalisation of employment law, have altered the positive health effects associated with employment ( Jahoda 1982; Goldsmith et al. 1996). Using information on switches between unemployment and employment by contract type we analyze whether transitions to different contracts have different health effects. We find that unemployed workers show positive health effects at job acquisition, and also find the positive effect to be smaller for workers who obtain a fixed-term job. We also establish surprising differences by gender and country, with women less likely to report positive health effects at job acquisition. For West-Germany, this was found to be a function of the dual-burden of paid and unpaid care within the home.

AB As a result of an initiative by the European Statistical Office as part of its Statistical Harmonisation Programme, a prototype of a common European Socio-economic Classification ( ESeC) has been created. ESeC is a categorical social class schema based on the concept of employment relations. The paper explains the conceptual basis of ESeC, describes the categories of the classification and how they may be collapsed for analytic purposes, as well as indicating how it is operationalised. The operational variants of ESeC, depending on the data available for its construction, are also discussed. In the second part of the paper some key findings of comparative analyses which use ESeC to examine issues relating to unemployment, education, poverty, deprivation and health across the EU are summarised. These analyses demonstrate the potential of ESeC as a major advance for an improved understanding of the patterns of European social inequalities. As such, this new classification should be of vital importance to both academic and policy researchers.

ID BAYESIAN INFORMATION CRITERION; MODELS; ASSOCIATION; CRITIQUE
AB Research on socioeconomic homogamy was developed by stratification researchers who used marriage patterns to describe how open stratification systems are. In cross-national studies primary concern on marriage homogamy lies in examination of commonality and differences in their social structures. Following large-scale international studies we use the European Social Survey data 2004-2005 to examine the association between spouses' educational levels. Loglinear analysis is applied to assess: (i) degree of association between education of spouses, (ii) patterns of barriers to intermarriage, (iii) variation in homogamy for partners with the same education for primary, uncompleted secondary, secondary, and university levels, and (iv) asymmetry in marriage patterns between women and men. The strongest association between spouses' education is in Slovakia, followed by Czech Republic, Norway, Germany, Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, Estonia, and Slowenia, whereas the lowest association displays in Luxembourg, France, Sweden, Finland and Belgium. In addition to previous research we found intercountry variation in division into post-communist and Western democracies. In line with all earlier studies we found - upon examination of parameters estimated for educational levels - a uniform tendency according to which the difficulties of intermarriage varies monotonically with differences between educational level of spouses. The tendency toward in-marriage proved to be the strongest in the lowest educational levels - such pattern takes place in the 14 countries. Finally, our analysis substantiated presence of net tendency to 'marry up' higher educated husbands by women but we find that it is by no means an universal rule and in seven, out of 22 countries examined, it is men who 'marry up' higher educated wives.

AB This article addresses why the literature on Inequality of Educational Opportunity (IEO) reaches diverging results concerning the decline or persistency of IEO over time. The main argument in this article is that the diverging results may be caused by the fact that the social class variables used to capture trends in IEO act as proxies for unobserved family-background influences that are substantively different from social class. The article analyses extremely rich longitudinal data from Denmark spanning three generations within the same family lineage. It demonstrates, first, that the effect of social class on secondary schooling is overstated when other family influences, conceptualised as economic, cultural and social capital, and unobserved family influences are not taken into consideration, and second, as in the other Scandinavian countries, that IEO has declined significantly in the postwar period.

AB This article addresses how the type of higher education participation an individual has chosen is related to his/her success on the labour market after graduation. In the first part of the analysis, the ideal types of 'from school-via higher education-to work' transitions are formed with the help of cluster analysis. In the second part of the study, the relationship between the type of transition and the socio-economic prestige of the occupation obtained after graduation is analysed through regression analysis. Data used in the analysis comprise educational and labour market histories of graduates with master's degree in seven European countries. Results indicate that there are significant variations among European countries in terms of the most common types of transitions. In addition, the study shows that the socio-economic level reached soon after graduation does in fact depend on the type of the transition, independently of other individual characteristics.

ID IDENTITIES
AB Globalisation and Europeanisation are complementary and partly overlapping processes that identify the increasingly supranational context in which political and educational systems are operating. This article explores how Turkish youth in two German and English secondary schools relate to the European knowledge economy, and how their political identities are shaped by school dynamics ( ethos, curriculum and peer cultures) and social class positioning. Drawing upon mainly qualitative data, the paper indicates that when the concept of Europe is allied to multiculturalism, there is the possibility of including minority ethnic groups like the Turkish Muslims and giving them the opportunity of relating to the European knowledge economy. If, however, Europe is understood as a white Christian concept, then Turkish teenagers will struggle to relate positively to Europe as a political identity. The article not only gives voice to young Turkish Muslims in Europe but also assesses the potential for Europe to be a common ground for all youth to negotiate their identities.

AB Although citizenship and youth have traditionally seemed to be two terms with very little in common, recent years have shown an enormous interest in analysing their relationships. On one hand, exploring how the new generations become citizens is a key issue for understanding the characteristics of the civic life of a society. On the other, the concept of citizenship has revealed itself as a potent conceptual and analytic instrument for explaining youth transitions. In order to acquire a deeper comprehension of these relationships, we believe it necessary to advance in their empirical study, to acknowledge their multidimensional character, and to defend a dynamic perspective of citizenship. This paper approaches the study of citizenship from its cultural dimension and proposes an analytical framework for the empirical study of the discourses and representations of what being a citizen means to young Europeans. Our analytical framework is structured along two axes: the dimension of belonging and the dimension of involvement.

SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES

DT Article
DE trust; money; euro; European Central bank; identity; mimesis
ID MONETARY-UNION; IDENTITY; COLOR; MONEY
AB This article starts from a pervasive puzzle that characterises the use of all money: Why would anyone actually exchange real goods and services for a piece of paper, a token coin or an electronic blip? The author of this article argues that market participants accept money in an exchange based on the trust that others will do exactly the same. While it is the basis of any existing monetary order, trust becomes particularly relevant in the case of a newly created currency such as the euro. In addition to being new, the euro is also a supra-national currency and, therefore, lacks some of the political and cultural factors that help facilitate trust in single nation-states. How can one conceptualise the formation of trust in the euro under these circumstances? This article examines the evolution of trust along two dimensions: horizontal and vertical trust. Horizontal trust gets established through mimesis and identity. Vertical trust relies on institutional mechanisms - in particular the interaction between a specifically assigned agent of monetary trust ( the European Central Bank) and guardians of trust ( other political actors as well as societal players).

AB This article investigates to what extent nationalist and anti-out-group drives contribute to the explanation of political euro-scepticism, in addition to economic and political drives. The authors disentangle individuallevel, regional-level and country-level effects by using the European Social Survey, covering 21 European countries (n = 34,160), which is enriched with region and country characteristics. Perceived threat from immigrants as well as political distrust increase political euro-scepticism, explaining low levels of euro-scepticism among higher educated people, higher income categories and socio-cultural specialists. At the contextual level, the authors find that scepticism increases with the distance to Brussels. Moreover, it is found that in countries where television broadcasts are dubbed, euro-scepticism is lower than in countries using subtitles. The authors find small effects from intra-EU trade and number of foreign tourists. In particular, differences between countries in political euro-scepticism are explained by duration of EU membership.

   and citizenship; European political communication; European integration;
   communication rights; depoliticization
AB In this article I correlate the lack of a common European public space for information and communication with the lack of a sense of a common EU citizenship and common European identity. The demonstrable deficit in communication is both vertical and horizontal. It alienates citizens from their elected representatives but also from crucial current public affairs. Citizens remain thus ignorant about power brokering in Brussels. It affects equally people from different coutries, individual citizens across the Union. I argue that both the growing ignorance of European citizens about Europolitics and their mounting disaffection with it derive from an entrenched political communication deficit. I hold that this malaise sustains the longlasting EU political crisis and its notorious democracy deficit. The study locates these crucial political and communicative problems, but when examining policy efforts to remedy them, similar policy gaps and non-policy-making are manifest. I analyse the media landscape, which with regards to contents of political news and current affairs, is nationally based, nationally oriented and controlled. This is then juxtaposed with the prevailing condition of huge voids and gaps in publicising, screening and in monitoring Europolitics. I then correlate the broadly documented ignorance of Europeans about their common political affairs with the absence of pan-European common public space. Similarly, the documented disaffection and abstention of citizens from political activity and Europolitics more specifically is accounted for by the absence of a common European political communication system. I further argue that, in the twenty first century, the medium of television, which in synergy with new media such as the Internet becomes interactive, is the best instrument to fill these gaps of the still missing common pan-European public space. The new media landscape offers the technical preconditions for the development of 'communications rights' strategy and, thus, for the development of a common televised public space that can approach the functions of a pan-European public sphere by allowing both active information functions, debate and dialogue between Europeans horizontally. Notwithstanding these new technological possibilities and in spite of the pressing needs for trans-national communication on Europolitics and between citizens, such potential is not exploited by European leaders. This results effectively in the abandoning of the crucial requirements for political communication to the 'forces of fate'. It is empirically proven that nationally entrenched and commercial media have quite different objectives and priorities from those necessary for the function of a complete political communication. The former assume localist or nationalist perspectives whereas the most dominant of latter ones pursue globalist and exclusively profit seeking strategies. By definition, neither category can serve the objectives of European integration and or serve citizens' needs from the European perspective. So, although communications' rights can now be readily deployed, although pan-European television channels can contribute to a complete and responsible political information and communication, and although these are fundamental prerequisites for the development of a common European identity, a European solidarity and for the much sought after European integration process, these means are not taken advantage of. Hence, the point is that this problematic condition frustrates both EU citizens and the objective of European integration.

AB In this article I argue that journalistic coverage on environmental I risk issues can contribute to the emergence of a European public sphere. The transnational character of environmental issues and the need to find political solutions for them on national and transnational levels pose challenges to the journalistic coverage. I examine this by considering three empirical studies, all of which use content analysis as their main methodology. These studies compare the coverage of issues such as biotechnology, air pollution and BSE in European media outlets. My conclusion is that coverage on environmental risk issues in national media, though not synchronous and consensual but rather asynchronous and controversial and stressing the own national point of view, does contribute to the emergence of a European public sphere.

AB This article addresses the growing concern about a communication deficit in the European Union, and specifically with the notion that communication technologies may be deployed to overcome existing deficiencies in the dialogue between the union and its citizens. It examines proposed solutions to the deficit, including the notion of a European public sphere, and the creation of 'e-Europe' with the increasing digitalisation of many processes and institutions in the hope that this would make them more accessible, accountable, and effective. It argues that these hopes are rooted in myths, both technocratic and bureaucratic, that ignore the persistence of social divisions in media and communications technology use, and in the necessity of universal values as part of the national and parochial experiential of European citizens before it could be expanded to a transnational level.

SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES

DT Article
DE children in the news; news-values; journalism; childhood
AB Research on the ways children are presented in the mainstream news media has recently become a focus of attention in Media Studies, stressing news approaches that oscillate between demonizing children and picturing them as a powerful symbol of victimization. Furthermore, children themselves do not make any statements: they are simply not heard. Similarly, there is an emphasis on episodic events, imbued with emotional or moral components. There is also a focus on risk situations, delinquency or parental advice on how to deal with new generations. This contrasts with little attention being paid to economic and social policies based on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Based on these ambivalences, a longitudinal analysis of Portuguese newspapers (1970-2000) and a comparative analysis of European newspapers during a week in 2000, have been carried out in order to determine what and how they report children and related issues, and what frames have been changed or maintained. Consequently, the article explores the many facets of reporting and the implications for our public life, particularly with regards to children.

AB This article considers the possibility of a European public sphere contributing to a reduction of the so-called 'democratic deficit' through engagement of citizens in the European project and enhancing processes of identification beyond the local or national environment. We elaborate on our interpretation of the European public sphere, emphasizing that political actors, including citizens, are engaged in political communication about Europe, either directly or indirectly through media or Internet-based representations. The study presented in this article investigates the extent of Europeanization of political communication on the Internet by measuring the visibility of communication about Europe on websites produced by various political actors in nine EU member states in the context of the 2004 European Parliament election. Two-thirds of the websites included in the study actually had European Parliamentary election-related content on the front page at the time of the election; a percentage we consider relatively low because of the search strategy followed. Actors addressed general European issues somewhat more frequently on their websites: in nearly three-quarters of cases, which can be considered an indicator of the existence of a European public sphere.

AB This article presents an analysis of changing spatial relations in the Baltic region from an Estonian viewpoint. Changes in spatial relations during the last decade are indicated by the density of personal contacts, news flows, cultural exchanges and trade relations between Estonia and other countries. The empirical analysis is based on statistical data and survey results. Analysis of media content has been conducted to reveal the level of attention given to different foreign countries. The results show that the structure of mediated spatial relations differs from the social space of practical interactions between people. The spaces of direct economic relations and personal contacts in Estonia are centred on the Baltic Sea, illustrated by the dominant roles of Finland and Sweden, an increasing proximity to other EU countries and the weakening role of Russia. At the same time the mediated social space of Estonia is changing following EU enlargement; from the representation of a bi-polar world dominated by political centres located in Russia and USA towards a multi-centred international space, demonstrated in the growing influence of core EU countries.

ID CITY
AB Public transport is often given a key role in the reinvigoration of European cities. The paper explores the relationship between urban citizenship and urban transport through a study of four cities (Athens, Bologna, Dublin and Helsinki). Urban citizenship is considered to comprise both 'social cohesion', i.e., the participation in the public space of the city, and 'social inclusion', the right of all inhabitants to physical mobility within the city and hence to access employment and social facilities. Despite the claims of urban planners, there is only weak evidence that reducing car usage contributes to social cohesion, but there is however stronger evidence that reducing car dependency contributes to social inclusion.

AB In this article we examine the occurrence of social capital in 21 different countries. Our study starts from the premise that the countries under scrutiny represent different kinds of welfare state regimes. The concept of social capital we separate here into bonding social capital, bridging social capital, generalized trust and informal support. Our main question is whether or not social capital varies systematically between different welfare state regimes. In this respect, our aim is to put to the test two opposite assumptions: the society-centred hypothesis that assumes that strong welfare states may weaken the preconditions in which social capital emerges and the institution-centred hypothesis that assumes that social capital emerges expressly in societies with strong welfare state institutions. Although mainly confirming the latter assumption, our research findings also emphasize the fact that the different forms of social capital are connected to welfare state regimes in different ways. On the basis of our results, it is possible that the welfare state both prevents and promotes the development of social capital, depending on the respective meanings given to social capital.(1)

AB The article examines the patterns of Internet use in 15 European Union countries. In the theoretical part, it is discussed how the social scientists have addressed the consequences of the diffusion of the new information and communication technologies (ICT). It is asked whether there is a potential in the use of ICT for increasing social inequalities within and between the affluent societies. In the empirical part, it is examined whether the 15 European countries selected have qualitatively different patterns of Internet use from each other. Results from Eurobarometer 56.0 survey data collected in 2001 (N= 16,200) show that the basic socio-demographic factors explain the use of the Internet rather similarly in the then EU area. However, it is also revealed that the institutional differences between European countries affect the strengths of socio-demographic factors.

AB Although the availability of social support and psychological attachment to work have been shown to influence mental well-being in unemployment, the main determinant suggested in research is economic strain. Yet, though the level of state support in unemployment is the most crucial determinant of economic strain, there has been little research on the impact of welfare benefit regime on mental well-being among the unemployed. In this paper we compare the impact of benefit regime by comparing the unemployed in Britain, Ireland and Sweden. We find that the type of benefit received is an important determinant of mental distress with income replacement benefits being more beneficial than flat rate benefits. Results also show that different systems differentially impact on different groups with income replacement benefits tending to maintain pre-unemployment differences in distress and flat rate benefits equalising these differences.

DE migration; mobility; multilevel; European Union
AB Individual mobility within the European Union has remained rather low, in spite of large socio-economical differences and the lack of political restrictions for citizens of member states. Taking this as a starting point, this paper sets out to develop a more appropriate view by combing aspects of economic and sociological migration theories both at the macro and micro levels. For this purpose, the Eurobarometer survey 54.2 of 2001 is analysed by applying a three-level regression. Therefore, different characteristics of 15 European countries, 196 nuts-2-regions and about 7,000 respondents aged younger than 45 years are considered. Analyses show that the assumption of push-and-pull models - namely, that people leave less developed places - applies only within countries. In fact, the highest migration intentions can be observed in regions with a developmental gap compared to the overall level of a country. But between countries, the effect is quite the opposite - the highest intentions can be found in highly developed countries. However, the explanatory power of macro-level variables is rather low compared to that of individual characteristics. Therefore, research should place more emphasis on individual characteristics, to estimate a migration potential more accurately.

AB This article analyses the economic integration of transnationally mobile Europeans into the German labour market. The measure used for the degree of integration is their relative income. Specifically, the article attempts to answer the question, whether and to which degree the integration of transnationally mobile Europeans into the labour market depends on their national origins or on their social origins. Based on the concept of transnational social mobility which goes beyond classical migration research, we will point out the factors that position mobile Europeans in the labour market and the feedback effects on national class systems. The results show that it is not national origin but social-structural characteristics that explains the positioning of EU-transnationals. The empirical basis of this article is primary data on Berlin's labour market gathered in the beginning of 2002.

DE cross-cultural research; insider/outsidership; access to data; aspects
   of gender; power and control; the principle of reciprocity
AB By adopting a reflective-reflexive approach, the paper explores aspects of positionality in relation to gender and culture and examines in what way they affect the generation of status and power within the relationships and social interactions of the research participants. By drawing on my personal experience as a female researcher operating in a male-dominated, foreign and yet familiar setting, I will analyse the mechanisms involved in the negotiation of the positions occupied by the various players and how this determined my status in terms of insider/outsidership. Particular attention will be paid to the facilitation of access to the field and the construction of knowledge. The data informing this paper were collected as part of a study of school-based models of initial teacher training in Germany, including contributions from the directors, tutors and mentors of three teacher training Seminars as well as my own observations. The relatively small sample of respondents and the researcher's subjective perspective of reporting and interpreting the findings preclude any conclusions of a general nature to be drawn. However, interesting data emerged, suggesting that aspects of gender and culture as well as the researcher's biographical background constitute powerful factors in the positioning of the research participants, which have methodological and epistemological implications. In the light of these findings I would argue that by adopting a reflective-reflexive approach the quality of the research account can be enhanced by making the mechanisms involved in the negotiation of positions of power and control more transparent. Finally, the analysis presented is intended to act as a caveat against the simplistic assumption that a researcher's familiarity and biographical affiliation with the setting will assist him/her in establishing and maintaining control over the research process.

TI Work-life balance in Europe: A response to the baby bust or reward for
   the baby boomers?
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The academic analysis of work-life balance (WLB) has too often followed the public policy debate without sufficient reflection on its origins, the accuracy of the assumptions it tends to make, or the analytical adequacy of the concepts it uses. This paper suggests that what are usually assumed to be the causes of the debate (longer hours and greater stress at work, along with the collapse of the male breadwinner division of parenting and employment responsibilities within couples) are nothing of the sort. Rather the debate's origins lie in states' concerns about demographic trends, especially low and falling fertility, which they fear threatens the future of the labour supply and viable dependency ratios between those in work and those dependent upon them. The WLB debate can thus be seen as part of a specifically liberal discourse about 'population ageing' that seeks to legitimate the rolling back of a welfare state by arguing that current levels of support cannot be sustained in a globalising world. This analysis reveals two new features of WLB policies. First, most are quite contradictory. What makes them popular (such as enabling the 'baby boomer' generation to withdraw from work on favourable terms) also makes them unlikely to address their goal of specifically supporting parenting and avoiding a 'baby bust'. Conversely effective support for parenting may require far more fundamental change than most WLB policies envisage. Second, demographic change has heightened the importance of the inter-generational transfer of resources between those now retired from employment, those currently in it, and those yet to enter it. This reveals a key feature of WLB policies to be how far these transfers are socialised or left to the family.

   flexible working time or opportunity for time sovereignty?
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English

DE human resources policy; regulation; working time accounts; time
   sovereignty; conduct of life
AB Working time is once again on the agenda. Actors in industry and politics are demanding the extension of working time and greater, market-oriented flexibilisation in the interest of cutting costs. At the present time the advocates of further reductions in working time and greater time sovereignty for employees have little say. At the same time, the compatibility of work and life has become an increasingly important issue, not only as a problem for working mothers but for corporate human resources policy as a whole. Forms of regulating flexible working time that promise to balance various time interests are therefore particularly important. One option of major interest is the institution of working time accounts, which permit flexible overtime as well as the use of 'banked' time to meet personal needs without generally extending working time. The study provides insight into corporate working time arrangements in various sectors and employee time choices in reconciling company requirements and private interests. Neither side has yet made adequate progress in creating the preconditions for a successful balance.

TI Work-life balance and industrial relations in Italy
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE work-life balance; welfare state; industrial relations; trade unions
AB This article examines the work-life balance system in Italy, with particular regard to the role played by extra-statutory arrangements and provision - extra leave, benefits and allowances for parents provided by employers, in-company creches, family-friendly working hours, etc. originated from collective bargaining and industrial relations at company-level. The Italian pattern of welfare state and women's employment is characterised by weak state support, a relevant role of intergenerational solidarity, one of the lowest fertility rates and still low women's activity rates. As for human resource management and industrial relations' contribution to work-life balance, empirical evidence shows that a certain number of extra-statutory arrangements and provision has been implemented at company level. Though, they are not enough to fill the gap with countries where state social protection is higher. The articles argue that industrial relations may play an important role in fostering a better work-life balance, on condition that a priority is given to decentralised collective bargaining and new 'territorial pacts' involving a wider range of social actors - not only unions and the companies, but also families, local governments, caregivers and the cared-for. Particularly for unions, this could be a possible response to unionisation decline.

TI Welfare states and work-life balance - Can good practices be transferred
   from the Nordic countries to conservative welfare states?
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE work life balance; welfare states; reconciliation of work and family;
   childcare leave systems
AB Within the European Employment Strategy benchmarking and learning from good practices are main mechanisms to improve national performance. This is also the case for WLB strategies which are reinforced because of economic reasons to increase employment and population growth. The paper asks for the main criteria for public policies to promote WLB and whether or under which conditions such policies are transferable between the successful Nordic countries and the less successful conservative countries like Austria and Germany. Denmark and Finland are used as 'good practice' examples. The analysis shows that childcare leave regulations are an important instrument to encourage mothers for continuous working careers. But the consequences of these regulations concerning employment turn out to be quite different, even in measures with similar orientation. What we can learn from the Nordic countries is that the consistency of welfare state regulations and institutions are an important precondition for a successful WLB. This calls for an interplay of different fields and means that the imbalance of family and work and family reconciliation can hardly be solved by flexible working contracts or longer parental leave possibilities.

TI The organisation of time over the life course: European trends
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE life course; working time; work life balance
AB Over the last decades, the life course approach has developed into a major research paradigm. The notion of life course provides a common field of research and a heuristic conceptual device aiming at studying individuals trajectories over time. In its modern version, the life course approach can be said to represent a major innovation in our understanding of complex social phenomena, making time, context and process core theoretical dimensions of social behaviour. Most of the research using this approach has stressed the extent to which social structures and individual factors shape the life course of individuals and has focused on the developmental consequences of alternative life trajectories. One of the main features of the life course approach is therefore to recognize the crucial role time plays in our understanding of individual behaviour and structural changes in society. The second important dimension of the life course approach is its attempt to take a holistic view, in that the analysis no longer focuses on isolated specific events, phases or demographic groups as being discrete and fixed but considers the entire life as the basic framework for empirical analysis and policy evaluation. The link between individual trajectories on one hand and historical period, social structures, as well as human agency on the other is also at the core of the life course paradigm. The notion of life course posits therefore that life trajectories are constituted by a palette of sequences of events that are both individually and socially constructed. The main objective of this cross-country comparative paper is to analyse to which extent the design of national welfare state regimes shape households' patterns of labour market integration over the life course. An analysis of the various national regulatory frameworks, with special focus on institutional opportunities and/or barriers to combine paid work with other social activities, is provided. Special attention is also given to companies' human resource and time management and whether human resource strategies encompass a life course perspective. By linking the specificity of the various regulatory and social protection systems to the country's current patterns of labour market integration the authors not only examine the impact of the overall institutional framework on time allocation over the life course but, also the extent to which the current working time options actually affect the sustainability of the social protection systems. Finally, in the conclusion, some policy implications are suggested with a special focus on the needs of finding new forms of time organisation and distribution of income over the life course. According to the authors these new forms of time management might contribute to a better work life balance for employees and might favour positive compromises between firms' productive efficiency and employees' needs for a larger control on their time structures over their life course.

ID INFORMAL CARE; COSTS
AB As the number of older people in need of long-term care increases, efforts to support older people remaining in their home are intensified in most OECD countries. In this context, there is a movement towards allowing more individual choice for older people receiving publicly funded long-term care at home. Having more flexibility in terms of how to receive care can increase the older person's self-determination and that of his/her informal caregivers. Having a choice among alternative care providers can empower older people as consumers and may help strengthen the role of households in the care-management process. The main aims of this article are (i) to categorise and analyse different types of arrangements allowing home care users more choice and map the prevalence of such arrangements in OECD countries, (ii) to give an overview of some country-specific outcomes in terms of care quality for care recipients, and (iii) to discuss some implications for employment and fiscal sustainability.

DE care; professionalism; consumerism; informal care; market; family
AB One of the icons of the Dutch welfare state reforms is the Personal Budget. With the introduction of this budget, care patients now have become consumers. They can manage their own budget and employ a care worker who cares according to the cared-for's wishes. The Personal Budget intends to create a market of care, as well as a shift of balance of power from professionals to care receivers. In practice, the market has not come yet. Instead, the majority of budget holders employ a family member. This is important as it gives recognition to informal carers. On the other hand, this may hamper the employment career of people with care responsibilities as they are likely to be constrained in their care relationship. Another caveat is that the Personal Budget undermines the professionalisation process of care workers. When consumers are in charge, care workers are no longer the custodians of their professional development. This may have unwelcome consequences for the quality of care in the long term.

AB Reforms that aim at empowering recipients as 'consumers' are often seen as self-evidently favourable and unavoidable. Current narratives on public-sector change describe the previous service regimes as rigid, uniform and inhumane, whereas reforms are regarded as offering a flexible and responsive future. Accordingly, consumerism has become a major driving force behind Nordic welfare reforms. This paper presents a more nuanced analysis of the suppositions about the past systems for home care services and offers a critical view on current reforms and the assumptions underlying them. Empirical examples are drawn from field research and personal interviews undertaken before (1995) and after (2000) the Norwegian home care service was caught in the wave of New Public Management reforms. The paper demonstrates how contractual arrangements implemented in the name of the consumer run counter to established practices based on personal trust and continuous dialogue on needs.

AB In the United Kingdom, New Labour articulated a consumerist view of the relationship between the public and public services. Its view of the citizen-as-consumer was the source of considerable political controversy and debate - both within and beyond public services. In this paper, I explore four aspects of consumerism in relation to social care in the United Kingdom: the political context of the rise of the 'citizen-consumer'; the place of the citizen-consumer in social care policy; the responses of organisations providing social care to consumerist pressures and lastly the impact of consumerism on characteristic tensions in public services.

DE consumerism; care; elderly; choice; home help
AB Traditional welfare institutions are challenged by the desire to design our own individual welfare packages. Politically, the response can be to introduce choice in social policy, also from the aim that the pacified welfare client should re-materialise as an active welfare consumer. This paper analyses the development of the form and concept of consumerism in social policy, taking the domiciliary care for the elderly in Denmark as an example. It seems that consumerism has become part of the logic of governance, and new forms of responsibility have been created which not only empower but also condition the individual citizen. The consumerist approach implies a new social construction of social policy; a second-generation do-it-yourself social policy in which the imperative is to secure the right to choose, more than equality of opportunity to choose or equality of outcome.

   influencing mobility
ID SEX SEGREGATION; ATTAINMENT; TRANSITION
AB After the collapse of the USSR, the post-Soviet states chose different strategies to build up their economy and society. In our research, we use data of young adults in five countries that represent these strategies. Baltic countries, Estonia and Latvia, are the examples of 'bottom up' shock therapy which opened opportunities to everybody and therefore everybody was engaged. Belarus is an example of a country with a still ongoing command economy with very few changes to the market in the late 1990s. The Russian region, Sverdlovsk, and the Ukraine region, Kharkov, are examples of 'top-down' privatisation and still shrinking economy in the late 1990s. We hypothesize that different paths of transition influenced intragenerational mobility patterns for young adults. We estimate the impact of respondents' gender, education, income, economic sector and the characteristics of parental background on intragenerational mobility. We found that Belarus differed from other regions, as young adults there were the least mobile, and the chosen factors had very little explanatory power in the analysis of intragenerational mobility. In the Baltic countries, intragenerational mobility was well explained by typical factors of mobility in a market society. Seven years of transition to the market is too short a time to make statements about long-term trends, but we can still investigate three major strategies to the market and predictability of intragenerational mobility.

ID POLICY
AB Though activation has been a key theme in recent comparative scholarship on social policy, existing research has arguably failed to capture some important cross-national differences in the extent of welfare state adaptation it entails. Conceptualising activation as but one unemployment policy reform indicator alongside 'unemployment support homogenisation' and 'unemployment policy co-ordination', and empirically sketching reform trends in four European states, this article argues it is possible to identify a cleavage between countries where activation policies are part of an unambiguous adaptation of labour market policies to the emergent post-industrial economy, and countries in which similar trends of policy adaptation have been more constrained, hesitant and uneven. To account for this fracture it is necessary to understand the differing ways that conventional unemployment policies were institutionally articulated within national political economies, as this bears on the feasibility of a new paradigm of labour market regulation emerging.

AB Youth labour markets where informal recruitment practices predominate are likely to amplify existing inequalities among young job seekers. Whereas most literature on informal recruitment focuses on characteristics of individual job seekers and the nature of the jobs they obtain, this article suggests to relate this important issue to overarching dynamics of welfare and labour market institutions. Analyses of survey data among young people with a history of longer-term unemployment in eight European countries suggest that comprehensive welfare state arrangements may substitute for the importance of personal network resources in the job search process. Thus the welfare state may intervene by providing active measures to facilitate the job-matching process and by providing economic means to make young people less dependent on their social network. The level of youth unemployment also seems to be related to the extent of informal recruitment, which is found to be more widespread in the countries with high rates of youth unemployment.

DE special education; inclusive education; learning opportunity;

AB With educational expansion and rising standards, ever more students are being transferred into special education. These programs serve children and youth with 'special educational needs' (SEN), a heterogeneous group with social, ethnic, linguistic, physical, and intellectual disadvantages. An increasing proportion of students at risk of leaving secondary school without qualifications participate in special education. While most European countries aim to replace segregated schools and separate classes with school integration and inclusive education, cross-national comparisons of special education's diverse student bodies show considerable disparities in rates of SEN classification, provided learning opportunities, and educational attainments. Analyses of European special education demographics and organizations emphasize institutional instead of individual explanations. Findings from Germany and the United States further demonstrate that which students bear the greatest risk of becoming less educated depends principally on the institutionalization of special education systems and on definitions of 'special educational needs'.

AB This is a study of the relationship between trust in institutions and attitudes to gene technology in general, and GM food and stem cell research in particular. The role of so-called active trust is emphasised, meaning that trust is neither conceived as a trait nor a one-dimensional concept. The study uses data from a Eurobarometer survey of gene technology in Europe, conducted in 2002. People's attitudes in five European counties, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and United Kingdom are compared, and the significance of trust in institutions in these countries is investigated. The results show that trust in institutions has an impact on attitudes to gene technology. Trust in experts, stakeholders and official bodies are associated with positive attitudes to GM food and stem cell research, whereas trust in Non-Governmental Organisations is associated with negative perceptions of these technologies. This confirms the significant role of active trust.

ID INTEGRATION; MODEL
AB This paper focuses on the development of an employment anchored social policy framework within the European Union and explores how changing governance structures within the EU may influence national policy in this area. National Action Plans on Employment and Social Inclusion are the key pillars of the EU employment anchored social policy framework. The associated open method of policy coordination (OMC) is the process through which these plans are formulated. The achievement of the EU employment objectives is considered as is the issue of quality in employment and the constraints on its achievement in the context of a labour market characterised not only by the growth of high quality jobs but also by a substantial proportion of low quality jobs and a policy framework that gives primacy to economic over social policy. I consider the potential and limitations of the OMC for enhancing social policy objectives in the EU, in particular the gender equality dimension and conclude that a single OMC process involving all member states is essential in employment-enhancing areas if an employment anchored social policy is to be sustained, gender equality is to be achieved and the radical potential of OMC realised. The theoretical context within which these questions are addressed encompasses issues relating to governance of social policy at the supranational level and its linkage to national welfare regimes.

LA English
DT Article
DE social support; precariousness; women; neighbourhood; social networks
ID STRESS; MODELS
AB This paper examines the extent to which families living in precariousness in contemporary European cities draw on social support as a key resource in their struggle against poverty. The comparative observations and analysis presented draw on national level survey data as well as local level qualitative data collected in selected European neighbourhoods, under the auspices of the BETWIXT project.(1) More specifically, our analysis focuses on the active modes and mechanisms for requesting and providing solidarity and support at times of familial crisis. The comparison of the Irish and Italian experiences illuminates the persistent involvement of households in informal support provision, even as family structures alter and welfare regimes change. We demonstrate the dynamics underlying the phenomenon of social support among precarious families living in deprived urban areas in the cities of Dublin and Turin. We address the dialectics between agency and structural constraint by examining whether or not family and/or social support networks are reinforced or further weakened by factors such as economic hardship, unemployment, and neighbourhood dereliction. We conclude that the effects of precariousness are multiple and contradictory: precariousness can create anomie and individualisation but it can also act as a spur to greater community cohesion. Such cohesion can also be expressed in terms of heightened social divisions along ethnic lines (the case in Aurora, Turin) and class lines (the case in Kilmainham, Dublin).

AB A recurring assumption is that undeclared work is market-like and motivated by monetary gain and thus that participants make a rational economic decision to engage in such an enterprise. In consequence, the predominant public policy response has been to seek to deter this work by ensuring that the expected cost of being caught and punished is greater than the economic benefit of participating. Here, however, and drawing upon evidence from 861 face-to-face interviews conducted in England, an alternative reading of undeclared work is presented more appreciative of the heterogeneous work relations and motives involved and its variable meanings. This identifies how although some undeclared work is market-like and conducted for monetary gain, there is also undeclared work conducted under social relations and for motives more akin to unpaid mutual aid. The paper then explores the various policy options that could be adopted and their implications.

DE food safety; trust; Russia; Denmark; Norway
ID DISEASE; RISK
AB In this paper we argue that institutional conditions should be taken into consideration when consumers trust in food safety is analysed. Our survey results demonstrate that levels of trust in food safety varies considerably across our three selected countries: Russian consumers expressing the lowest level of trust, Norwegian consumers the highest and Danish consumers expressing levels of trust in food safety which were in between. We find empirical evidence in all countries that consumers trust in food safety is related to their evaluation of how their national food control authorities perform, as well as to what extend they trust market mechanisms to secure food quality. However, while trust in food safety in the Scandinavian countries is more likely to rest on trust in public food control, trust in food safety more often depend on trust in market mechanisms in the St. Petersburg region.

TI Revolution, class and globalisation in the transition from state
   socialism
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE revolution; social class; globalisation; transition; state socialism;
   Russia
AB With the disintegration of communist rule in central Europe and the USSR, the social formation of state socialism ended. What has followed is described in Western sociology and political science as a transformation or a 'transition' to democracy, markets and capitalism. The paper considers traditional Marxist approaches to the transition to capitalism and criticises the model of state capitalism as well as the world system approach. In contrast, it is contended that three social classes played a major role in the fall of state socialism and a move to capitalism: endogenously - the acquisition and administrative classes, and exogenously - the global political class. The political leadership of Gorbachev was crucial in tilting power away from the loyal administrative class. It is argued that different combinations of these class groupings determine the type of social formation which is evolving. The globalisation of capitalist companies and the direct role of global economic forces had little importance under state socialism, but have had more significance since 1989. With respect to the penetration of transnational companies, important differences have developed between the central European countries and those of the former USSR. Barriers limit the spread of global capitalism: among these are disparities between the interests of local domestic and export industries, the legacy of state socialism and the continued presence of state ownership. In this context, global capitalism is evolving in central Europe whereas in Russia and Ukraine there is a hybrid social formation containing elements of state economic control, national capitalism and global capitalism.

AB This paper explores the changes that are taking place in European higher education: a shift from the Humboldtian notion of the university to one that operates under quasi-market pressures. While increasing the culture of accountability in universities, this development, linked to shifts in their sponsorship and associated 'missions', is associated with an erosion of traditional mechanisms of trust. The focus is on UK experience, which is now extending internationally. Lessons are drawn on some of the institutional changes and problems that may lie ahead for European universities.

ID TRANSITION; MOBILITY; EXPERIENCE; EARNINGS
AB The main question raised here is whether new rules of income distribution in Eastern Europe resemble opportunity structures in developed market economies. Implicit in theory of modernisation is hypothesis that returns to education stood at the highest in most developed capitalist societies. In the long-standing debate on the transition of post-communist societies to the market economy nobody compared Eastern European countries with Western nations in the first decade of transition to capitalist system. In what follows I attempt to fill this gap. I focused on direct comparison of effect of education on incomes in a number of countries representing both capitalist and post communist societies. Data come from International Social Survey Program 1996 and 1999. The analysis provides evidence that in the end of the 1990s economic benefits to education were still less in countries undergoing transition than in capitalist societies. However such knowledge provides only guidelines for understanding the most interesting question: to what extent post communist societies approached market-based patterns distribution of incomes. Although the analysis went beyond former studies, it displays only static picture. Due to lack of comparative cross-systemic data, on education returns, going back to 1980s, one has to concede that we will never find unequivocal empirical arguments which prove that effect of education under the planned economy was really lower. Contrary to most theories, one cannot exclude that this association might have been higher or the same as in the Western societies at the time.

AB This paper explores school-to-work transitions in three new EU Member states, Hungary, Slovenia and Estonia, focusing on the effect of the level of education and social background on the timing of the first significant employment and the match between educational qualifications and occupation among school leavers. So-called cohort effects are a focal point as well, since transition process and outcomes seem to be largely influenced by the dynamics of economic and social changes in the transition economies. To explore the early career developments of job entrants in the three transition countries during the 1990s, the study utilizes the European Union Labour Force Survey ad hoc module on school-to-work transitions, which has been launched in Hungary, Slovenia in 2000 and in Estonia in 2002. Event history methods are applied to explore transition to first significant employment, while the match of educational qualification and occupational attainment is modelled using multinomial logistic regression techniques.

AB This paper compares class patterns of 'conformism' in four Western countries, taking as its point of departure arguments, which suggest that conformism/ authoritarianism is more prevalent in the working class than other classes. Data from the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) are used in order to compare class attitudes towards sexual behaviour and civil rights/liberties, in Britain, Germany, Sweden and the United States. This study finds that class patterns in attitudes differ little between the countries in question, although aggregated levels vary quite substantially. It is also concluded that class differences in attitudes towards civil rights/liberties are almost exclusively a result from different levels of education, while significant class differences in attitudes towards sexual activities remain also after taking education levels into account. The implications of the results for social stratification and political articulation are discussed.

AB This article compares the socio-economic determinants of welfare attitudes in the Czech Republic to those in Sweden, using survey data from the 1996 ISSP survey 'The Role of Governments'. Many theorists of the transition have claimed that the post-communist countries have a different political dynamic that their west European neighbors. For example, David Ost claims that that citizens of post-communist countries during the 1990s were not sure of which class they would belong to and therefore, were not sure of their class interests. Similarly, Zagorski claims that in post-communist countries educational level becomes one of the most important determinants of welfare and socioeconomic attitudes, because the reform process is very complicated. Those with higher levels of education can better understand the complexities of the reforms and are more willing to accept short-term disadvantages for long-term gains. However, many experts have also claimed that the Czech Republic presents an exception to these trends. It is the one country in which party-competition is based on socioeconomic issues and voting is class-based. This study tests these three hypotheses, to determine whether the Czech Republic really does provide an exception to the general post-communist development.

DE informal care; comparative social policy analyses; family values;
   development paths; care arrangements; childcare
AB In many European welfare states in the last decades, the state provision of social care services has increased, in part even in spite of retrenchment policies in other areas of state welfare policies. Informal childcare has, however, survived everywhere in Europe, until today a substantial proportion of care is provided informally in the family. The degree to which informal care has been formalised, and the social rights and state provision in relation to formal and informal care, differ substantially in comparison of European societies. In comparative social policy analyses, the explanatory framework is often based on a kind of evolutionary approach. According to this argument, the degree of formalisation of informal care is determined by the degree to which welfare states support gender equality and the labour market integration of women. It is argued here that such explanatory framework is not sufficient. It is not taken into consideration that informal care has itself been modernised: and that the promotion of informal family care does not necessarily contradict ideas about gender equality. Within Western Europe, with respect to the role of informal care, at least two different development paths can be distinguished. Differences with respect to the underlying family values contribute considerably to the explanation of such differences. The quality of social rights in relation to informal care, on the other hand, varies according to the welfare regime and the underlying welfare values.

The paper then goes on to consider possible meanings and significance of such developments, in particular whether it is possible to argue that they may contribute, or have the potential to contribute to the emergence of a sense of 'Europeanness' among followers of football, especially the young.

DE family change; family policy; family and welfare state reform;
   demographic and social risks; gender and family relations; family in
   European society
AB Family change and the risks associated with it form the departure point of this article. The intent is both to elaborate the nature of family change in European societies and to interrogate contemporary policy on the family in the light of emerging changes and risks. The first part of the article undertakes an overview analysis of the main changes affecting families, looking at structure, organisation and relations. It then moves on to consider the key risks and challenges posed by recent changes for individuals, states and society. The risks discussed include the seeming lack of readiness to commit to parenthood, a polarisation between parenthood and partnership, overburdening of women and risks around care. The final section of the article turns to the state's response, in terms of what it has been and what it might (need to) be. It shows how policy on the family, while a growing area of intervention, has actually narrowed in scope, becoming more an arm of employment policy and operating to a rather unidimensional model of family, viz. the two-income family. The underlying story is of a continuing divergence between states' responses and what people wish for their family life. When it comes to the family, states it seems are always out of date.

AB Large-scale European research programmes have provided an impetus for social science researchers to co-operate more closely not only across national and cultural boundaries but also across disciplines and research paradigms. Attempts to make sense of diversity have led to a blurring of the traditional methodological divide between quantitative and qualitative paradigms, opening up new perspectives and creating opportunities for synergy and complementarity. The paper draws on examples of the methods used in a cluster of European projects and networks in the field of family and welfare to illustrate the epistemological and practical problems raised when applying multi-methods approaches to research into European societies. It argues that, once these problems have been overcome, by combining methods within and across projects, researchers can expect to gain a deeper understanding of social phenomena in different national settings and develop new insights into complex issues.

TI Vulnerability and multiple deprivation perspectives on economic

SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE economic exclusion; multidimensionality; vulnerability; multiple
   disadvantage; latent class analysis
ID SOCIAL EXCLUSION; POVERTY; INCOME
AB In this paper we address issues relating to vulnerability to economic exclusion and levels of economic exclusion in Europe. We do so by applying latent class models to data from the European Community Household Panel for thirteen countries. This approach allows us to distinguish between vulnerability to economic exclusion and exposure to multiple deprivation at a particular point in time. The results of our analysis confirm that in every country it is possible to distinguish between a vulnerable and a non-vulnerable class. Association between income poverty, life-style deprivation and subjective economic strain is accounted for by allocating individuals to the categories of this latent variable. The size of the vulnerable class varies across countries in line with expectations derived from welfare regime theory. Between class differentiation is weakest in social democratic regimes but otherwise the pattern of differentiation is remarkably similar. The key discriminatory factor is life-style deprivation, followed by income and economic strain. Social class and employment status are powerful predictors of latent class membership in all countries but the strength of these relationships varies across welfare regimes. Individual biography and life events are also related to vulnerability to economic exclusion. However, there is no evidence that they account for any significant part of the socio-economic structuring of vulnerability and no support is found for the hypothesis that social exclusion has come to transcend class boundaries and become a matter of individual biography. However, the extent of socio-economic structuring does vary substantially across welfare regimes. Levels of economic exclusion, in the sense of current exposure to multiple deprivation, also vary systematically by welfare regime and social class. Taking both vulnerability to economic exclusion and levels of exclusion into account suggests that care should be exercised in moving from evidence on the dynamic nature of poverty and economic exclusion to arguments relating to the superiority of selective over universal social policies.

ID SEX-DIFFERENCES; SCHOOL
AB This paper examines gender differentiation in early labour market outcomes across twelve European countries. In spite of the fact that the educational attainment of women has now surpassed that of men in many countries, differences persist in the type of educational courses taken by young women and men. Countries differ in the extent of educational segregation by gender but certain regularities are evident, with health/welfare, education and arts courses dominated by women and engineering courses dominated by men. Gender differences in field of study are found to play an important role in channelling young people towards gender-typical careers. Thus, countries with higher levels of educational segregation by gender are found to have higher levels of occupational segregation by gender. However, gender continues to have a strong direct effect on labour market outcomes in both track-differentiated and general educational systems.

AB The aim of this paper is to present a descriptive overview of patterns and labour market outcomes characterising the labour market entry in Estonia compared to the EU countries. The assumption that labour market institutions and educational systems have an impact on the labour market entry process makes up the starting point for the formulation of the hypotheses. The hypotheses have been formulated on the basis of the comparison between the educational systems as well as labour market institutions in Estonia and in the EU countries. The paper draws upon data from the Estonian Labour Force Survey (ELFS) 2002 and from the 1997 ELFS' macro level data about the EU countries. The paper will present evidence concerning differences in labour market outcomes between new entrants and experienced workers. Based on macro level data, the analysis will attempt to empirically identify distinct country clusters.

AB This paper distinguishes the characteristics of recent trends towards older ages of leaving home in Spain. Based on analysis of in-depth interviews with young people and parents from Bilbao in the Basque Country, I explore how familism and family solidarity play a key role in the current trend towards delayed family formation, focusing on the postponement of leaving home. This analysis illustrates the various leaving home strategies that young Basque people adopt, and how these are negotiated with parents and other family members. The analysis of the interview data also captures the ways in which young people negotiate with and recreate family culture, both while living in and leaving the parental home. The different strategies adopted by young people are classified by a typology based on the extent to which young people recognise and conform to a prescribed cultural model of behaviour, namely leaving home to get married and (preferably) buy a property.

ID ETHICS; FOOD; UNCERTAINTY; DEMOCRACY; KNOWLEDGE
AB The article argues that the crisis of legitimacy of environmental policy is closely connected with its declining effectiveness and efficiency in front of the growing saliency of uncertainty. Trust and responsibility are relevant analytical dimensions for addressing this issue. Contrary to the former, the latter has been poorly explored in its applications to policy issues. To this purpose a typology is presented, which helps to understand the evolutionary logic and current weakness of environmental policy. Theoretical reflection is supported by a study on public views of food safety. Trust and responsibility confirm their relevance. Opinions about the different actors involved in the food chain and the regulatory and control systems are contradictory, while attempts to provide trust with solid grounds are confronted with attitudes of mistrust, suspicion and resignation. Overall, citizens' concerns remain largely unanswered. This indicates that institutional and corporate unresponsiveness represents a major issue, negatively affecting the social legitimation of food policy.
