AB This paper analyses the notion of difference (viz. otherness) which is held to be 'normal' and thought to deserve general respect. This claim is put into question with regard to manifold empirical works in disability studies which draw attention to the context of a culture of sensibility for differences which resist a general normalization of otherness.

AB For the past years the German labor market has become more differentiated and diverse. Yet the existing flexibility and dynamic does not indicate pluralization alone. An explorative qualitative study on routine services, carried out between 2009 and 2012, provides insights about the consolidation of a certain social status. Our findings are pointing to a process of "proletarianization". Integration in different labor market institutions is selective and leads to a stabilization of disadvantaged perspectives and an unprivileged status for routine service workers. Work is marked by strategies of social rationalization, which enforce an ongoing dynamic of disqualification and devaluation. A specific control system produces a process of segmentation that undermines positional advantages. The loss of future perspectives risks the consolidation of disadvantaged perspectives because the idea of possible change is not available.

ID WORK; ORIGINS
AB The paper aims at reflecting on subject-related work orientation from both a theoretical andempirical perspective. In the German sociology of work and organization the thesis of a normative subjectification is primarily understood as the subjective half of a transformation process. The claim on self-realization in work is assumed to provide emancipatory aspects, because it would aim for more autonomy in the contextual constraint of a labour-oriented society. Our analysis questions this assumption. We will confront theoretical approaches to youth and socialization underlying the thesis of normative subjectification with the socio-structural thesis on the distinctive character of self-realization. Employing a multivariate and representative data analysis of the ALLBUS 1991 and 2010, we will show that normative subjectification neither is a youth phenomenon nor is it independent of social origin. Self related work orientation occurs less among ambitious youths than with established elderly. Our reading of the concept of habitus suggests that our findings can be decoded as a distinctive semantic that legitimates social inequality and its reproduction.

AB In the German educational system school achievement in primary school is crucial for long-term educational success due to the early transition to secondary education. Various studies have shown that school achievement differs between children with and without migration background. We focus on migration-specific inequalities of fourth graders in terms of their school achievement. According to Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital, social inequalities are reproduced, since on the one hand only higher social classes possess cultural capital and on the other hand cultural capital is a prerequisite to succeed in the educational system. This paper discusses if the concept of cultural capital can be used to shed light on migration-specific inequalities. Analyses based on the the project Immigrants' Children in the German and Israeli Educational System (N = 631) show that grades in German classes and independently measured reading performance are positively correlated with familial resources regarding cultural capital. Furthermore, under controlling for cultural resources no migration-specific inequalities are observable.

AB This study investigates whether and how characteristics of the pre-school educational sector are associated with differences in health and socio-economic inequalities among adolescents in European and North American countries. Data were collected from the school based "Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC)"-study in 2005/2006, which includes 11- to 15-year old adolescents from 34 European and North American countries (n=159.824). Hierarchical regression models were conducted for multiple psychological health complaints, including individual determinants (family affluence, age and gender) and macro-level determinants from the educational pre-school system (participation rate in public and private pre-school institutions), controlling for national wealth. Socioeconomic inequalities in psychological health complaints were found in the majority of European and North American countries. Adolescents, living in countries with high participation rates in private pre-schools showed lower likelihoods of reporting psychological health complaints and smaller socioeconomic inequalities in health complaints in comparison to countries with low participation rates. In contrast, the participation rate in public pre-school sector was not significantly associated with health complaints and inequalities in health complaints. Reducing health inequalities should continue to be an important public health strategy with emphasis on the young population in all countries. Macro-level characteristics, such as in particular characteristics of the pre-school sector, are - besides individual characteristics - considered as relevant factors in tackling socioeconomic inequalities in health among young people.

AB This article critically discusses the work of the physicist and STS scholar Karen Barad, one of the most influential and important representatives of contemporary materialist scholarship. Barad's perspective of "agential realism" combines insights from Niels Bohr, one of the leading figures in quantum mechanics, with elements of poststructuralist theory. The article starts with an overview of the central ideas and concepts of agential realism, highlighting how Barad develops her theoretical perspective by a critical engagement with the writings of Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Niels Bohr and Emmanuel Lovinas. The second part of the article argues that agential realism mobilizes and prolongs the insights of theories of "situated knowledge" within feminist science studies, and it stresses the analytical strengths of this research perspective before focusing on two conceptual ambiguities and theoretical problems in Barad's work that so far have not attracted sufficient scholarly attention. The third part of the paper focuses on inconsistencies in how matter is conceptualized within agential realism, while the last part argues that Barad's notion of responsibility is at risk to depoliticize ontological questions. The article concludes by offering an account of the theoretical and empirical potential of agential realism.

AB Proceeding from Bourdicu's habitus and capital theory, this paper asks whether the cultural resources of families and the surveyed students have an impact on the status attainment process between the ages of 15 and 45. The analysis is based of the life45 survey, which rests on a follow-up of a youth study conducted by Fend et al. between 1979 and 1983. As a result it can be shown by means of a structural equation model that there is a substantial transmission of cultural capital between the parents and their children and that the student's cultural resources have an effect on their educational attainment (reproduction effect). Besides this social heritage the amount of cultural capital by the age of 35 also depends on the educational attainment. The effect of cultural capital during the life course is limited to the end of the vocational education.

SO SOZIALE WELT-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIALWISSENSCHAFTLICHE FORSCHUNG UND
   PRAXIS
LA German
DT Article
AB Dieter Claessens was one of the first professors of sociology in post WWII West Germany. Marked by his experiences of war and imprisonment, he began to concentrate on the question which mechanisms give internal structure and stabilization to society. Influenced by the sociologists of the 50 s, the categories organizing his work were,status' and,role'. In his first major study, Claessens showed the ever changing nature of,status', from pre -industrial times to the modern middle class era. He understood,status' as the mediator between social and individual claims, whereby the binding tie of status is seriously endangered by the growing mechanization of the work place and everyday lives.
   The threatening loss of social binding, according to Claessens, is opposed by the growing importance of the so-called Primarstatus" [primary status]. As a natural part of every individual, the Primarstatus" emancipates itself from its social environment and becomes the determining drive in the struggle of the individual for social acceptance and ascent. The ambition to climb up the social ladder, so Claessens's judgment, marks the motive protecting the individual from a state of dissolution. He even thinks of a so-called,Aufsteigergesellschaft' as being egalitarian, and yet he senses the price being paid for this kind of social stabilization. He finds his rescue in the middle class family. Family, status, and social ascent - this is in his eyes what it takes to have a stable society.

The naming of foreign/mainland brides is a by-product of Taiwanese identity. However, their self -naming as new migrant women is exposed to the risk of re-essentialization. Following the reflection on the categorizing even if positively made, it will discuss the possibility of exclusive individuality. Finally, this article will suggest that in addition to the idea of humanity and full citizenship "all are created equal", the idea of otherness "all are created different" should also be underlined.

ID CUMULATIVE ADVANTAGE
AB Evaluations of scientific productivity are part of the common daily business in all scientific disciplines including sociology. An extensive, but contested project to measure research quality in German sociology was the Forschungsrating of the Wissenschaftsrat (WR) that was completed in 2008. A group of 16 renowned sociologists evaluated about 250 research units using five categories from "excellent" to "not satisfactory". The evaluation of research was based on over 10,000 publications in a compiled database and about 700 submitted exemplary pieces of research (journal articles, contributions to edited volumes, editions of volumes, monographs). How can this ambitioned project retrospectively be assessed? How is the return compared to the investment? The article aims at a reconstruction of the evaluation on the level of research units. Results prove that the judgment of research quality is overwhelmingly influenced by output measures such as the number of publications in peer review journals. To a large extent the judgments can be predicted by few quantitative indicators. Obviously, the experts also took the size of units into account.

ID SOCIAL-SCIENCES; HUMANITIES
AB We analyze the citation impacts (,cited') and citation practices (,citing') of sociological journals which publish mainly in German, and discuss major drawbacks of using the journal impact factor (IF) to assess the quality of these journals. First, sociological literature moves very slowly in terms of citations, whereas journal impact factors (IF) measure short-term impact at research fronts. Second, the citation distributions are heavily skewed because of the so-called Matthew effect (Merton) of cumulative advantages; one should not use quasi-averages (such as the IF) given this skewness. The alternative of using non-parametric statistics (e.g., percentiles), however, requires delineation of the reference sets. We discuss the unsolved problems in the case of (inter)disciplinary delineations and show empirically the ecological fallacy in nevertheless attributing journal characteristics to individual papers. Algorithmic constructs (e.g., the various rankings) cannot be used for policy or management purposes without validation or specification of statistical error.

ID IMPACT FACTOR
AB Although the debate about the Journal Impact Factor and other forms of quantitative performance measurement rages on those whose performances shall be assessed through these instruments have rarely been consulted on this topic. In a first attempt to fill this gap, this article studies the effects of quantitative performance measurements on the work and careers of young academics in Germany. On the basis of 20 interviews with academics from ten different disciplines who already obtained their Ph.D. but have not yet received tenure, three arguments are developed: (1) In contrast to the academic tradition of pure devotion to the cause, the increasing use of quantitative performance measurement contributes to turning science into a "career job". (2) Especially those scientists who are focused on vertical advancement strategically try to enhance their publication output in order to increase their chances for success. (3) Self assurance and routine in the publication process largely depend on the support of mentors.

AB Owing to conceptual and technical problems, the Journal Impact Factor is not a valid measure of a journal article's quality. Still, it is employed because it can easily replace the assessment of content and promises objectivity as well as comparability. It will continue to be used as long as it can serve as a pseudo solution sciences for increasingly frequent evaluation problems particularly in the life, sciences. There is some hope that the emerging movement against the use of Journal Impact Factors grows faster than first attempts to use them in sociology.

AB The Impact Factor had it's day. Altmetrics and the Future of Science Abstract: Altmetrics is a response to criticisms of the journal impact factor as a means in research evaluation. By extending the resonance spectrum from scientific sources covered by traditional bibliometries towards non-scientific sources, Altmetrics draws on user-generated data in the Social Web. Altmetrics suggest measuring the broader impacts of research by numbers. Triggered by the idea of a democratization of science, the implementation of Altmetrics is booming. Moreover, Altmetrics tools act as a catalyst of the digital shift towards Open Science. As a side-effect, however, the accompanied demand for popularity might superimpose epistemic criteria.

ID GLOBALIZATION; ELITES; FRANCE
AB Through an exactly repetition of a study in 2005 this paper tests the results of an analysis about the internationality of top managers. It analyses the nationality and the careers of top managers of the economically most powerful European (Germany, France, UK, Italy and Spain) and non-European countries (China, Japan and USA). The essential findings are: There still exists no global or transnational business class. The internationalization of the managers in the eight countries shows different trajectories. On the one hand, in Germany and the UK it progresses relatively quickly. In China and Japan it regresses. In the other four countries, there is only a slow progress of internationalization. The main obstacles for internationalization are different career types. In countries where careers happen partly in governmental institutions (China and France) or traditionally in one company only (Japan) it is very difficult for foreigners to climb the ladder to the top. Only in conjunction with such career patterns elite universities constitute an obstacle for internationalization.

AB In accordance with the single market programme, EU-research policy aims at a stronger orientation towards the economy. Its core instruments are the 'Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development' that emphasize a economic logic and challenging the traditional structure of the German academic field. European research policy is guided by the discursive model of a global knowledge economy. German research policy, however, is substantially shaped by the German Research Foundation, which represents the model of academic autonomy, financing diverse research topics and universities. Based on the latest data, this paper observes how the 7th Framework Programme's focus on economics and 'Global Research Universities' opposes the more pluralistic logic of the German Research Foundation. Tracing this tension empirically, fundamental questions are touched concerning the future of German higher education: While big and technical universities profit from European competition, smaller universities and especially those focusing on social sciences and the humanities are losing ground.

AB This paper presents some results of a meta-analysis of studies researching the so-called "pedosexual victim-to-victimizer transition". This transition relates to persons having been victims of pedosexual abuse and becoming adult pedosexual offenders (child molesters). Our meta-analysis is based on a total of 26 studies investigating the victim-to-victimizer transition with the data of 3781 observed and questioned persons. The results verify the transition hypothesis impressively. In addition, a large amount of the effect variance can be statistically explained by estimating multi-level models with various moderator variables, although each single moderator variable has only a small influence on the size of the transition effect. A publication bias potentially that is distorting the results of meta-analyses could not be detected.

AB The traditional peer review process for the assessment of scientific performance has been increasingly supported by citation analysis. However, bibliometric methods require the use of appropriate indicators to be meaningfully and significantly. The trend of performing bibliometric analyses by amateurs is most problematic.Seemingly easy to handle tools serve requests of decision makers for impact data and rankings. In this article we plead for the application of professional citation analysis embedded into bibliometric research. For example, journal impact factors are not suitable for measuring the performance of a researcher, because they do not allow conclusions about the impact of single papers published in a specific journal. The h index measures output (number of publications) and impact (number of citations) in one single number and connects both parameters arbitrarily. Instead, percentiles are far better suited for measuring the citation impact of publications and researchers. Using percentiles, publications of researchers and their citations can be visualized as beam plots. Beam plots show at a glance, how productive a researcher has been in a specific year and how often his publications have been cited in relation to comparable publications.

ID IMPACT
AB The argument between propagators and opponents of quantitative performance measures in research and higher education is at a stalemate. On the one hand are those who promote enthusiastically quantitative performance measures, not giving much thought to issues of misrepresentation and unintended consequences. On the other are the 'essentialists' denying the admissibility of transforming qualitative assessments into quantitative ones and reverting to a fundamental argument about the nature of science in general and the university as its core institution in particular. In between are the 'pragmatists' who occupy a strategic position in being the forward oriented vanguard combining reflective analysis and shaping the technology of indicators and their applications. I argue that the confrontation of promoters and essentialists is missing the point. Blind belief in the technology of numbers is as misplaced as its outright rejection that does not recognize the strength of social change driving it. In fact, individual scientists, universities and research institutions, large scientific publishing companies as well as science policy and bibliometricians are entangled in a tight arrangement in which quantitative measures have become the central currency and everyone profits from dealing with it in some way. Control by numbers is a social technology fired by digitization and has replaced trust in institutions. The old world of academia is thus past. There is no alternative to the pragmatists' efforts to shape that technology.

TI From deprofessionalization to reprofessionalization in hospitals? Locum
   doctors between market, organization, and profession
SO SOZIALE WELT-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIALWISSENSCHAFTLICHE FORSCHUNG UND

AB Regulatory reforms in the health care sector confront hospital doctors with the phenomenon of deprofessionalization of their work. In this context, managerial instruments become increasingly important to medical decisions, which can lead to dysfunctional outcomes (e.g. in terms of patient care quality). This development comes along with the disengagement of physicians who leave the organization to become self-employed. As locum doctors, they work for an appropriate fee in different hospitals on a temporary basis. In view of the different kinds of commodification at the individual and organizational level, our main research question is: How does the commodification at the organizational and individual level affect the professional behavior of doctors in hospitals? We refer to a qualitative study with locum doctors, employed physicians, chief physicians, and hospital managers. As a result of individual level commodification, locum doctors manage to overcome organizational restrictions, which in turn can lead to a reprofessionalization of the medical work since they have the freedom to take medical decisions based on professional standards and not solely on economic criteria.

AB This paper investigates the frequency of church attendance during the course of life., Firstly, we test the expectation of 1) a positive impact of a Christian socialization and good inter-generational relations in the family socialization and generational hypothesis. 2) a positive impact of family attachments and occupational involvement 3) a negative impact of occupational success self-transcendence hypothesis, and 4) a positive impact of experiences of illness and death crisis hypothesis. Secondly, Christian convictions are discussed. We also expect that the frequency of church attendance should increase monotonously (confirming ageing hypothesis). The sample consists of 1301 former German high school students, first interviewed in 1969 at the age of 16, and re-interviewed at the age of 30, 43, and 56. Without control of Christian convictions the socialization hypothesis is confirmed for some indicators; the self-transcendence hypothesis is confirmed only for family attachments and the crisis hypothesis is not confirmed at all. With controls for Christian convictions the remaining effects are reduced. In both analyses,the ageing hypothesis could not be confirmed.

TI "How to handle me". The biographic relevance and prospects of advanced
   health care directives
SO SOZIALE WELT-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIALWISSENSCHAFTLICHE FORSCHUNG UND
   PRAXIS
LA German
DT Article
AB In Germany the Advanced Health Care Directive ("Patientenverftigung") gives citizens the option to define the acts medical staff may and must not take in an anticipated final treatment situation (living will). Based on a case study on the subject matter, this paper assesses which individual horizons of relevance the matter pertains to and what the potential consequences of this new option might be. To that end, the work recaptures some of the central arguments that dominated the discourse in the media. Thereby, efforts were made to pass the bill and it established inter-subjectively divisible imaginings of one's (own) final medical treatment as the most devastating personal disaster. It appears to be a necessity to write a living will as quickly as possible since the final treatment scenario is being perceived as an ever-present threat; a risk. Based on the reconstruction of group discussions, this paper focuses on the specific prospects of the living will and its subjective meanings. In this context, it is possible to distinguish between four typical ways of addressing the subject matter of living wills: radical fiction, bureaucratic assurance, reflective scepticism and sovereign refusal. This indicates that the use of living wills reveals relatively little about the relevance and the degree of reflection on one's own passing and death. Instead; it should be viewed as an indication of the need to assure oneself and the need to make one's own decisions on a voluntary basis. Being compelled to imagine a dramatic (final) treatment situation one finds oneself in and one's own death create a sense of security in the here and now.

ID CONTINGENCY
AB Bruno Latour rightly suggests that sociology should "indulge in empirical metaphysics" in order to put the relation between philosophical, respectively metatheoretical argumentation and social practice back on its feet. But Actor-Network-Theory (ANT) as proposed by Latour lacks a meta-theoretical foundation to conceptualize multiple reflexive relations. Drawing upon Gotthard Gunther's work, we propose a perspective that tries to fill this conceptual gap. The proposed approach allows for empirical research that is sensible to phenomena of societal differentiation without confusing theoretical claims with social practices.

AB Different disciplines have been analyzing the blurring boundaries between spaces of work and consumption Yet, this disciplinary division has impeded the insight that individuals are not only acting as workers or consumers, but that they obtain a twofold role as workers and consumers in their everyday life. This article shows that companies are already addressing their employees in their twofold role as workers and consumers. On the one hand companies provide various goods and services to satisfy their employees' consumer needs. On the other hand, companies approach their employees to perform as consumers for company purposes as they are interested, for example, in their consumption experiences to enhance innovation processes. This article shows that in both cases consumption plays an important role in shifting and blurring boundaries of the working sphere. Moreover, it is illustrated that processes of blurring boundaries in the working sphere and the consumption sphere can be interrelated.

AB Biotechnological developments have boundary expanding effects on living and embodied practices as well as on societal patterns and codes. The increasing erosion of modernity's constitutive basic principle, the bifurcation of nature and culture and related divisions such as as lived body/body, natural/artificial, human/machine unfold indeterminate spaces of the cognitive-discursive and practical-material. Exploring the field of aesthetic surgery, the article shows the risky handling of these indeterminate spaces and focuses on the de- and restabilization of modernity's taken for granted matters of facts and divisions. Employing a practice-oriented and in depth-hermeneutical cultural analysis, the paper deciphers the practiced divisions in place and discusses their challenging effects.

AB Experimental results on allocation situations show that giving behavior is strongly determined by sociological factors and driven by both egoistic and social motivations. With a factorial survey design we investigate how employers in small and medium sized companies in Germany decide how they would allocate 10.000 Euro between themselves and fictitious employees that vary regarding some characteristics. We focus on the relative strength of fairness norms and sanctioning power of the employees on the bonus payment as well as how both is being influenced by different informational conditions. For this, subjects are randomized into one of three decision environments that differ in their degree of transparency of the allocation. Knowing that there is a possibility for a bonus and knowing how it is allocated among the employees switches further motives for a bonus payment on and at the same time strengthens viz, weakens, though differently, both sanctioning considerations and the pursue of fairness norms. Although the fairness norm of proportionality dominates in each of the environments its degree strongly varies between non-transparency and transparency, indicating the divergence between subjective fairness ideals and social desirability. The impact of sanctioning power of the employees becomes absent through complete transparency. Altogether we show that social control not only influences the amount of bonus paid, but also the criteria of how to allocate.

AB We study the decision process in a group dictator game in which three subjects can distribute an initial endowment between themselves and a group of recipients. The experiment consists of two stages: first, individuals play a standard dictator game. Second, individuals are randomly matched into groups of three and communicate via instant messaging regarding the decision in the group dictator game. In contrast to former studies our results show that group decisions do not differ from individual decisions in the dictator game. Furthermore, the analysis of the chat history reveals that players make proposals according to their preferences as revealed in the single dictator game and that these proposals in groups drive the final allocation.

AB There is a growing body of research showing that people altruistically enforce cooperation norms in social dilemmas. Most of this research analyzes situations where norm violators are known and group members enforce cooperation among each other. However, in many situations norm violators are unknown and detection and punishment is enforced by third parties, such as in plagiarism, tax evasion, doping or even two-timing. Our contribution is threefold. Conceptually, we show the usefulness of inspection game experiments for studying normative behavior in these situations. Methodologically, we present a novel measurement of strategic norm adherence and enforcement, asking for continuous, "frequentistic" choice probabilities. Substantively, we demonstrate that norm adherence in these situations is best understood by coexisting distinct actor types. Self-regarding types learn the inspection rate and calibrate their norm violations to maximize own payoffs. Other-regarding types reciprocate experienced victimizations by stealing from other unknown group members; even at additional costs. We specify both mechanisms by agent-based simulation models and compare their relative explanatory strength by behavioral and attitudinal data in inspection game experiments (N = 220). Our results suggest a modern sociological perspective, which combines homo oeconomicus with homo sociologicus. Further, our findings contribute to understanding conditional norm compliance in broken windows" dynamics, since we show under controlled conditions that such dynamics may result jointly from self- and other regarding mechanisms.

AB Surveys on prejudice often yield biased results as the respondents give "socially desirable" answers in many cases. By contrast, in our study on prejudice and discrimination, we conducted four field experiments in the City of Zurich wherein members of different nationalities or religious groups asked a favour. For example, passers-by were asked a favour by a person wearing a headscarf; and, conversely, without a headscarf in the control condition. In another experiment, persons were addressed in High German and, in the control condition, in Swiss German. A fifth experiment dealt with the reactions of employers in German-speaking Switzerland to unsolicited applications. With respect to everyday behaviour, no significant differences between the groups could be substantiated in the extent of their willingness to do someone a favour. All four experiments pertaining to little favours in daily life did not yield evidence of discriminatory behaviour, be it against Germans or Muslim minorities. However, note that the experiments were carried out in the City of Zurich and that the extent of discrimination might be substantially higher in other regions of Switzerland. Moreover, our findings suggest that certain ethnic groups are discriminated against in the labour market, even in cases when applicants have Swiss citizenship and the same professional qualifications as native Swiss.

In order to test whether moral or sanctioning cues reduce the extent of deviant behaviour, we conducted a field experiment. Besides these two stimuli, in form of information signs, we also included indicators of social control into the analysis. Our results show that posters reduce the probability of crossing on red. Thereby, the effect is slightly stronger for moral cues (reduction of 13 percentage points) than for sanctioning cues (reduction of 7 percentage points). However, the presence of other pedestrians has the strongest effect on jaywalking reducing the probability of jaywalking by 23 percentage points. If another person deviates from the norm, this causes a contagion effect and more of the observed subjects cross the street on red.

AB Modern societies are currently undergoing fundamental transformations concerning their regimes of surveillance and control. Established reactive activities of controlling and punishing deviant behavior are more and more giving way to proactive approaches that focus on the extensive acquisition of available data, regardless of reasonable suspicion. Mostly affected by this broadening governmental and commercial data collecting activities is the Internet.However, the social consequences of a comprehensive surveillance like altering the individual behavior in the digital space have hardly been studied. This research project which has been carried out in winter 2012/13 at the University of Rostock takes first steps to develop this field of research. It examines the impact of Internet surveillance on user behavior. The findings indicate a significant quantitative decrease in Internet activity of users believing to be monitored. However, only marginal changes concerning the content of visited websites are found.

AB Scenario-techniques or vignettes have been frequently used in the analysis of sensitive topics. However, up to now it remained an open question whether vignettes as an indirect technique of attitudes measuring lead to more valid measures of sensitive topics as classical, direct measures, e.g. with items. The study is based on the assumption that the detailedness of the descriptions and the disposition to respond in a socially desirable way will have an impact on the assessment of attitudes towards pro-social behaviors. In particular, the assumption that more detailed vignettes lead to more honest responses is analyzed on the basis of two split-ballot experiments. In one experiment, the vignettes refer to the experience of a pro-social opportunity in everyday life. This experiment focuses on a concrete situation of everyday life experience. In another experiment, the vignettes refer to pro-social opportunities in 'ordinary life'. Here, the special normative expectations towards the concrete situation are of interest. Computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) of adult inhabitants of a German city aged 18 to 65 were carried out (n = 560). Logistic and OLS-regression analysis revealed the result that the presence and intensity of responsibility for pro-social behavior depended on the detailedness of the vignettes only in vignettes that are related to 'ordinary life' referring to normative expectations. The results are discussed with regard to the underlying methodological assumptions.

ID WORLD
AB In the past thirty to forty years, the notion of 'knowledge', perceived as crucial driver for the economic development of nation-states and as key element for successful measures of international development cooperation, has been increasingly shaping global academic debates, national-level policy-making and development discourses worldwide (Stehr 1994, 2001). This paper critically assesses two differing, but overlapping discourses of knowledge, captured under notions of 'knowledge society' and the poverty alleviation-oriented 'knowledge for development', as communicative and discursive constructions of reality and redraws normative, factual and hegemonic characteristics of both discourses. Conceptually the paper builds on approaches of communicative and discursive constructivism. In particular, the sociology of knowledge approach to discourse developed by Reiner Keller (2011 a, 2011 b, 2005, 2003), Hubert Knoblauch's thoughts on communicative and instrumental action (1995, 2001) as well as Jo Reichertz' concept of 'communication power' (2010) guide the analysis. Drawing upon + a social constructivist and knowledge sociological (and additional to a post structural) perspective, the assessment of two global discourses of knowledge with local institutional, organizational and social consequences confirms the necessity to evaluate discourses and the discourse-inspired and discourse strengthening, communicative action of collective, powerful and less powerful actors concerning the construction of knowledge and power relations.

AB Environmental justice is a relatively new topic of environmental politics and environmental sociology. It mainly deals with the observation that underprivileged social groups more often live in areas of low environmental quality. In a first step, the article gives a short sketch of the U.S. environmental justice movement and of the international research about socio-spatial differences in the exposure to local environmental problems. In a second step, the justice concept within the debate about environmental justice is critically reviewed. It will be shown that socially unequal environmental conditions cannot necessarily be qualified as injustice. Additional factors must be at work that inequality turns into injustice, i.e., that unequal environmental conditions lead to justice claims. The article develops a set of hypotheses about such factors. These hypotheses seem to be important for research about social inequality and social stratification in general.

LA German
DT Article
AB In contrast to the general schooling system, standardized competence assessment in higher education is still underdeveloped. Interestingly, this also holds for the subject sociology where the competence for empirical methods and the consciousness for the necessity of valid indicators are supposed to be high. Furthermore, the developments regarding the "Bologna-process" and the current discussion in Germany about the so called CHE ranking suggest that there is a considerable demand for valid measurement instruments permitting to assess the acquisition of competencies by university students. In the present paper, we evaluate the feasibility of defining and measuring "sociological competencies". Alongside with general considerations, we present results and insights from a pilot study in which the competencies of 540 sociology students were measured in the style of the PISA studies. Sociological competencies are conceptualized as subject-specific cognitive performance dispositions, partitioned into sub-dimensions, operationalized by test items and scaled drawing on methods of item response theory (IRT). The findings demonstrate not only the general feasibility of comparable projects, but also show good scale characteristics of the competence indicator as presented here. Selected empirical analyses point to a high external validity of the indicator. Altogether, our results show that the idea of a standardized competence assessment in sociology should be pursued and further developed in the future.

AB In modern society, intimate relationships are generally seen as irrational and selfless; nevertheless, they are often described in terms of exchange in social sciences. According to theories of differentiation and exchange, this article is trying to assess the plausibility of exchange metaphors for the explanation of intimate relationships in the face of contradictions in the empirical research with exchange assumptions (I). For this reason, exchange concepts (II) are confronted with the modern semantic of love (III), with martial and long-term relationships (IV) and with the early phase of beginning relationships (V). Many inconsistencies between the principle of exchange and the modern conception of love are found, but also some possibilities to explain long-term relationships and even more the first contacts made to indicate a relationship in the light of exchange theory. Especially this last constellation is able to kindle love on the basis of uncertain reciprocity.

AB Social sciences have discussed the issue of governance of complex systems for a long time. The following paper tackles the issue "governance of complex systems" by means of experimental sociology, in order to empirically investigate the performance of different modes of governance. The simulation framework developed is based on Esser's model of sociological explanation as well as on Kroneberg's model of frame selection. The performance of governance has been measured by means of three macro and two micro indicators. Surprisingly, central control mostly performs better than decentralized coordination. However, results do not only depend on the mode of governance, but there is a relation between performance and the composition of actor populations, which has yet not been investigated sufficiently.

AB In this paper I aim to contribute to the debate about hegemonic relations between the West European "core" and Southeast European "margins", by showing the links between mutually challenged and engendered quasi-anthropological traditions in the totalitarian projects of nation-building and empire-building. New aspects of a continuous resonance will be addressed regarding a politically instrumentalized German-writing tradition of Volks- and Volkerkunde grounded in Herderian Romanticism and the imperial ambitions of the nineteenth century. In the course of discussion, the successive German traditions of National-Socialist Volkskunde and Communist East German Ethnographie until the revised tradition of Europaische Ethnologie in the 1990s are shown to operate from a historicist tradition rather than from a critical tradition as a reflexive successor to former Volkskunde. In this discussion particular attention is given to contextualizing the historical and current production of knowledge by the German and Austrian "West" on a Southeast Europeanand Albanian culture, which is reduced to its archaic or pre-modem "traditions" and its specific or antiquated "mentalities".

ID INEQUALITY
AB Based on an online-survey conducted in summer 2010, this article analyses with the concept of social background groups the social background of 1.340 university professors in North Rhine-Westphalia. It focuses on the professional standing of the parents and is divided into four groups,low' middle' medium high', and,high'. Since there are no similar data available for the social background of junior scientists the paper compares the latter with the social background of students. Moreover, this study analyses the relationship between social origin, locality (including discipline and status) and the sex of the professorship. Similar to other findings within educational research, the paper confirms a close relationship between the attainment of high education status and a privileged social background. 34% of the professors derive from the highest and only 11% from the lowest background group. The middle and the higher background group each represented 27% of the respondents. Accordingly more persons from privileged socio-economic families have reached a professorship. Time analysis shows that self-recruitment has intensified over the last twenty years through the increased appointment of incumbents from the highest society-groups, indicating a trend of social closure. Furthermore a statistically significant relationship between the social background and other variables like the disciplines, the status of the professorship, and the sex shows that the social origin of incumbents is very differentiated. For example higher concentrations of social risers are found in the Social Sciences. In effect, Universities can be seen as socially highly differentiated organizations offering dissimilar possibilities for social risers.

ID SCIENCE; INSTITUTIONALIZATION
AB Non-university research institutes are urged in particular to legitimize their existence vis-a-vis universities and need to develop unique features also known as profiles. In the last decade we have witnessed an increased pressure in science policy that research is expected to be of social relevance. Organizational studies discuss this development under the theme of 'organizational development,' especially focusing on universities. Until now discussion on 'organizational development' of non-university research institutes is sparse. The German Leibniz Association serves as an example to illustrate how non-university research institutes respond to external demands and how they process these demands internally. The paper is based on the micro-foundational concept of New Institutionalism revolving around the importance of language and daily routine actions within organizations allowing for insights into how external demands are handled internally. Two fundamentally competing systems of relevance can be identified: serving scientific communities and an alignment towards innovation. It is particularly in institutes catering for both systems of relevance, where organizational development is operational, as organizations need to find solutions in order to cope with areas of conflict. On the micro-level these organizational solutions are less formalized strategies but take shape in unstable

AB Studying at German universities with migration background is a currently debated topic for higher education politics merely considering the demographically growing group of minority students. Until now there is little systematic research on the studying conditions of minority students, their success chances at German universities, and on explaining factors for successfully managing the study programs. Based on a student survey at the University of Konstanz (N = 399), the article describes whether two success indicators (self-reported achievements and a problem index of using scientific methods) differ between the groups of students with and without migration background. Furthermore, it analyzes how possible differences are related to differences in study preconditions and requirements (grades of high school diploma (Abitur) and educational family background). The group differences for both indicators are small and almost fully explained by differences in grades of high school diploma.

   Sociological Film Analysis

LA German
DT Article
AB Despite its long tradition sociological film analysis is still not seen as a 'serious' method of empirical social research. Gaining more and more popularity in university courses and theses, its bad reputation partly feeds on the perception of film as a methodologically problematic subject. This perception stems from the fear of analyzing film material in a naive way by misunderstanding it as an authentic reflection of reality. Other reasons may lie in the blending of cinematic pleasure with research interests or in the difficult delineation to other - aestheticized or normative approaches. This paper wants to develop a methodological point of view that can help to establish film analysis as a full-fledged social scientific research method. Theoretically, it combines micro-sociological and interactionist perspectives (Erving Goffman and Harold Garfinkel) with Norman K. Denzin's film analysis. Empirically, it will focus on the interaction order of fictional film sequences portraying situations that can hardly be observed in 'real life'.

AB The working environment has been in motion during the past years. In Germany, the decade following the "Hartz-Reforms" is no longer marked by stagnation and immobility of the work force. This is due to a political arrangement of labor markets and work conditions which give priority to acceleration and fragmentation of work life. There is growing inequality between different occupational groups and occupational biographies have become more fragile. These processes can be documented using the example of an explorative qualitative panel study carried out between 2007 and 2011, in which we traced the lives of some 150 people who live in a precarious situation between exclusion from and access to the labor market. Our findings point to the development of an intermediate zone in between the labor market and the welfare system in which a precise distinction between inclusion and exclusion of the working environment is blurred. The life and work situation of our interviewees is characterized by frequent changes from welfare to various forms of employment, occupational statuses and biographical insecurity. There is strong evidence that in this situation new mentalities are shaped which are ruled by 'stability of instability'.

AB This paper presents the findings of a questionnaire survey about the forms and fields of genetic discrimination in Germany. We asked individuals at risk for four different genetic conditions, which represent the range of diversity in heritable disorders (dominant/recessive, high or low penetrance) as well as the severity and treatability of the symptoms. The questionnaire included standardized and open questions about negative experiences due to (presumed) genetic predisposition and questions with regard to fear of exclusion and stigmatization. The results show that analyses of genetic discrimination must be widened and deepened in three respects. First, people with and without symptoms experience unequal treatment and discrimination because of their genetic condition. Second, the generally ambiguous and ambivalent meaning of genetic knowledge with a potential for discrimination or relief has to be taken into account to a greater extent. Third, analyses also need to focus on the effects of rejection, neglect and disrespect in interactions with family, friends and acquaintances. In sum, the investigation reveals the need for a reorientation and widening of the definition of genetic discrimination.

AB Against the background of an increasing mobility the relevance of subjective belonging to places is frequently discussed. Some authors see a loss of functions and importance of concrete places for mobile individuals, others argue a renaissance of local realtionships through mobility-experiences. This paper deals with issues of multi-locality (as shuttles) and the concept of place attachment. The literature shows that previous findings vary along weakened, hierarchical or heterarchical place attachments and multi-locality; the underlying processes remain highly implicit. To fill this theoretical gap, the mechanisms of socialization and evaluation are theoretically hypothesized. It is assumed that place attachments of mobile actors are based on both, continuous local interactions (socialization) and subjective perceptions of place utilities (evaluation) and that the weight of socialization is compensated by subjective evaluations at the place of work. The hypotheses are preliminary examined by data from an online survey (N = 689) of mobile users of an intemet platform for carpooling. The descriptive results observe multiple place attachments during multi-locality. Furthermore, multiple regression analyses and a structural equation model gave some evidence for the validity of the hypotheses. Compared to the evaluation mechanism the socialization mechanism loses its explanatory power to some extent at the place of work (compensation). The findings indicate the importance of strong emotional affiliation towards places even during mobility and contain also implications for the concept of place attachment, which are finally discussed.

TI Transnationalism within? The social networks of urban Germans

   PRAXIS
LA German
DT Article
AB To what extent and in what ways have immigration and the growth of global connectedness made the social interactions of individuals more transnational? The article offers the first wide-ranging assessment of this question for Germany. It starts from the assumption that interactions between people of different national origins are not limited to cross-border interactions, but can arise from the multiple opportunities created by immigration processes available within one country. The paper shows that in spite of limited mobility, the urban population has 'border-crossing' connections that extend those to people in other countries. Four out of five respondents without immigrant backgrounds have friends or acquaintances with immigrant backgrounds. Clearly interactions between people of different national origins are not solely based on communication across national borders and not restricted to immigrants. The organization of networks reflects major structures of immigration to Germany. Among the ten most prominently represented countries are South and East European countries of immigrant origin, with Turkey in the lead. Apart from opportunity structures, cultural and social factors determine how strongly people from different national contexts are represented in personal networks. It seems that numbers, presence over time, cultural and political bonds, as well as positive and negative attitudes concerning people from different countries play a part. The article offers empirically grounded hypotheses in a under-researched field and aims to encourage further research. Data are drawn from a representative survey in German cities with 2500 respondents.

AB In this essay visual culture is not only understood in terms of an ongoing and increasing process of consuming visual materiallty, but as the very production of it. Contemporary discourse about visual culture highlight the dominance of the visual and the growing importance of images on all levels of (post)modern societies. Consequently, in order gain significance the language of images has to be adopted. To gain attention is to become visible. With the aid of an analytical attention-model that distinguishes four different forms of existence in visual culture, this paper shows that the position of human and other actors is dependent upon the capability to make themselves visible or invisible, or of how others can make them visible or invisble.

Following a hermeneutic approach,this can be achieved if one conceives the images that are to be interpreted as social acts and not as esthetic structures and patterns. In effect, this requires to differentiate between the performed act (the act shown with the image) and the act of indicating (meaning indicating with the image). Both types of social acts are already socially typified and within this type they are describable and noticeable.

AB Video recordings offer great advantages for qualitative social science research. They do, however, come with tricky limitations. The paper picks up on the debate about prudent use of video recordings in sociological research, sounding out the specific potential of this instrument of inquiry, analysis and presentation (of findings). Looking at research on "professional vision" in science studies we try to outline the constructive nature of these practices, which manufacture visual traces into evidence. In order to avoid implicit realism we argue for taking seriously practice-trained vis-ability as a necessary anchor point for the use of video recordings (in qualitative social research). Such an approach allows the researcher to take advantage of technical conservation and equally to reflect its principles of construction. Only in this way is it possible to see through the camera and at the same time past it.

ID VISION
AB The paper explores the complexity and variety of visual practices in social interaction using the example of boxing. At first sight a boxing match seems to be a physical fight between two parties, in which bodily strength and technical skills play significant roles for victory or defeat. The present case study, however, shows that visual practices of different people involved in the fight play an important role, too. These practices relate to nested and overlapping "scopic regimes" in boxing, requiring the visualization of actions as well as their concealment. This includes the boxer's ostentatious implementation of instructions that are vocally shouted into the ring by the coach as well as the boxer's demonstrative compliance with the boxing rules addressed at the referee, his performance of having successfully punched or of not having been hit by his opponent addressed at the scoring judges or his display of athletic fitness, moral integrity and bold vitality in regard to the spectators. All these specific forms of visibility are simultaneously performed, each addressed at its respective addressee, by the boxer in his individual actions. Not least in the area of boxing is scopic practice an activity distributed between athlete and coach that manipulates the visibilities, but also physical activities in relation to visual expectations of all parties present (opponents, judges, spectators). Seeing then becomes an intersubjective, cooperatively produced social good.

AB Using video-recordings of coach-athlete interactions, this paper discusses the importance of the body producing social situations, in which physical and visual activities are transformed into knowledge. From a sociology of knowledge perspective possible connections between Visual Sociology and Sociology of the Body are explored, providing theoretical and empirical perspectives, for analyzing body-centered interactions in sports. The example of a training situation in the sport of trampoline will show how actors orient to each other in the interactional process, produce new forms of knowledge and update socially shared stocks of knowledge by using visual and tactile resources. The result of the sequential video-based analysis leads to the intersubjective production of a "body tension" as a special knowledge, which is relevant for the performance of trampolining.

AB The paper explores the organization of the Distance Vision Test as a process through which optometrists derive an objective test score from subjective assessments of their clients' quality of reading out lines of letters. The analysis of video-recorded optometric consultations explores how the standard letter-chart features in the interaction between optometrist and client. It examines specific fragments of test procedures to reveal how aspects of the chart are used by optometrist and client to practically organize the test and to determine the quality of clients' distance vision. The paper argues that the objective definition of the test result requires that optometrists carefully introduce clients to the test procedure to avoid the reading quality and the test result being influenced by influences such as anxiety. Only after this introduction to the test, clients are encouraged to read a line of letters that follows a larger line they had difficulty to read out from the chart. The quality of the reading out of this line then is transformed into the visual acuity score. This process of transforming incommensurable qualities, reading out and seeing, into quantities in order to make them comparable, is called commensuration.

AB Many versions of qualitative-interpretative research focus on reconstruction that refers to data from memory based interviews. It is important, which kind of stimulus the researcher sets in order to evoke the disclosure of relevant information. In this function visual media lived in the shadow of purely oral interviewing. The article seizes the photo-based technique of interviewing and discusses the method of photo-elicitative questioning as an approach to reflecting and reconstructing past experiences. This provides an alternative to oral forms of qualitative interviewing and provides new forms to deal with the problems of individual's remembering.

DT Article
AB The current sociological preoccupation with the visual is very popular. In this paper, the key argument goes beyond the collection of visual data, the analysis of visual material and the theoretical and empirical consequences for the subject. This article wants to deal with a less illuminated aspect: the visual knowledge production and visual communication in sociology itself. The article argues that because of the growth of the visual in social processes, it is important to question the extent of written theory in sociological construction and communication. The growth of the visual challenges the discipline and therefore visual representation is on question. Along the example of sociological filming, this article contributes to the theoretical foundation of visual knowledge production and communication.

SO SOZIALE WELT-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIALWISSENSCHAFTLICHE FORSCHUNG UND
   PRAXIS
LA German
DT Article
AB How does a 'showing' ethnography succeed? Which methodological implications does it have to orientate ethnographic research towards processes of seeing and showing? The paper explores these questions from the perspective of camera-ethnography. In general, it is expected that a camera offers technical reproductions which are more or less similar to what is represented. In the context of camera-ethnographic methodology, however, the unfolding of an observing difference proves to be the criterion of quality of the processes of ethnographic visualization. The latter cuts paths of vision and enables selections during the use of a camera, thereby differing fundamentally from the sociological use of the camera as a mere documenting technology. This paper outlines the differences that a showing ethnography may produce: differences of the visual, of gazes and images, of the subject of investigation and of the situation become addressed.

AB In recent literature state action strategies and collective sensibilities condense to complex regimes of dealing with deviance and marginality. Thereby, national practices of handling social difference combine with public sentiments and mentalities to form coherent cultures of social control. In this article we investigate whether homogeneous cultures of control can be observed in a sample of European countries. Cluster analysis identifies three distinct regimes of governing social marginality: (1) an inclusive regime wherein generous welfare provision and little incarceration merge with low levels of fear of crime and public punitiveness, against the backdrop of considerable trust in public institutions; (2) an exclusionary regime of modest welfare benefits and high imprisonment rates, wherein fear of crime, punitive attitudes and low confidence in governmental institutions are widespread; and (3) a hybrid regime in which inclusive and exclusionary elements form a fragile alliance. The inclusive regime can be found mainly in Scandinavia, the exclusionary regime is implemented particularly in Eastern Europe.

AB What factors determine demand for consumer goods? Using the demand for lottery tickets as an example, the article discusses the imaginative quality of goods. According to Campbell (1987), consumption is explained from the consumer's attempt to realize fantasies stemming from socially constructed daydreams. On the basis of survey data, the study shows that lottery players who have daydreams and fantasies on winning large amounts of money spend more money for tickets and play more regularly. From this perspective, demand for lotteries is explained by its potential to create and maintain dream worlds which players find enjoyable to indulge in. With the ticket, lottery players buy an imagined dream on what to do with large amounts of money and on how this would transform their lives. Concluding the article possible applications of study beyond issues of consumption.

AB While market-based governance has become widespread in the welfare state and in health care systems, the coping process of those affected by it has remained under-researched. Drawing on accounts from economic sociology and structuration theory, this paper takes the example of the German hospital sector. It explores the cognitive processing of competition with collective actors representing major stakeholders of the sector and inhabiting the intermediary sphere concerned with operational governance. Based on interview and documentary data of funders, owners, regulators and various occupational groups, the paper shows that the different groups have different understandings of what competition in the hospital sector actually is and what it should be. Due to different perceptions of group interests but also to varying regulatory concepts there is considerable ambivalence concerning the issue. A common sense concept is quality competition. While such a consensus proves inconsistent after all, it does help stabilizing the market idea.

ID AGE; IDENTITY
AB A remarkable transformation has taken place within the normative order of the welfare state: Ageing is no longer considered as a "residual" phase of life that follows after having completed a normal employment biography. Rather, it is being reframed both as a productive resource for the political management of demographic change and as a biographical potential that can and should be employed by ageing individuals in their own interest. In this process, social norms, which previously applied to middle age phase, are being effectively extended to later phases of life. However, despite the new socio-political appreciation of old age and the elderly, symbolic and material inequalities among elderly people continue to exist and thus specific forms of social distinction. Especially those ageing subjects whose lifestyle is already in line with the new normative ideals may expect a "distinction rent" in the context of productive ageing discourses. Based on a qualitative empirical study, this paper examines the question of whether and how subjective interpretations of age(ing) relate to this discourse. The results show that a certain closeness to a "productive" lifestyle can be found especially in the educated middle classes. Consequently, the new appreciation of old age may result in an indirect stabilisation of the cultural hegemony of the (upper) middle classes.

AB In spite of its adverse effects, the automobile makes for an unprecedented technological artifact in the every-day life and choice of residence for the majority of people in Western societies. Simultaneously, cars are increasingly popular in regions of catch-up modernization. Yet, the limitations of fossil-fuels highlight that conventional, private automobility cannot serve as a universal model. Neither peak oil nor climate change allow for a continuation on this trajectory. With that in mind, this study frames automobility as a 'principle of modernity' by utilising the structuration approach of Anthony Giddens in order to explain the routine usage within the 'Lebenswelt' of the automobile. Moreover, this analysis seeks to explore continuities and discontinuities in the development of conventional automobility. Finally, this study will result in distinct hypotheses about future social dynamics of automobility including opportunities for and barriers to potential transformations in this field.

AB Within the German "Optionsmodell" young dual citizens have to decide if they want to keep their German citizenship and abandon that of their ancestors or vice versa. We assume that this decision reflects legal-pragmatic as well as social and identificational considerations. Findings of a survey among young so-called "Optionspflichtige" of Turkish origin, which was supplemented by guided interviews, reveal that nearly all interviewees plan to keep their German passport. However, this decision is not equally easy for all interviewees but varies depending on the perceived benefits and disadvantages of the different passports. Thus, German citizenship is chosen with ease when "Optionspflichtige" anticipate legal benefits of the German passport and perceive it as a prerequisite to feeling German. Feelings of discrimination, a strong attachment to the Turkish passport within the family and identification with Turkey render the decision difficult. Regardless of these aspects, especially the highly educated struggle with being forced to make this decision. This suggests that the adherence to the principle of avoiding dual citizenship might pose an obstacle to the naturalization of well-integrated individuals.

AB Political measures by no means always yield the desired effects. Instead they often lead to unintended results making it difficult to assess its effectiveness. An example for such a measure is the German Quarterly Medical Copay (Praxisgebuhr) which recently has been decided to be discontinued commencing January, 1, 2013. An analysis of the copay effects shows that most evaluation studies do not allow clear conclusions concerning the success or failure of political measures.

AB Decision Making in spite of Ignorance The Revitalization of Contaminated Areas
   Processes of decision concerning environmental processes or the impact of human activities on the natural environment often lack secure and robust knowledge. Nevertheless, such situations do not necessarily lead to uncertainties in environmental decision-making. The analysis of processes of revitalizing contaminated areas has shown that related actors explicitly deal with the unknown, i.e. with ignorance. Involved actors experiment with and find strategies dealing productively with ignorance, which aren't necessarily products of scientific knowledge. Hence, other strategies of dealing with non-knowledge need to be considered as well. Based on a dynamic concept of ignorance this paper shows how actors define the relevance of ignorance. Analyzing two revitalization projects, the paper offers an analytical model of decision, which takes into account the unknown. It also tackles issues like the legitimacy of decision-making, the understanding of failures, the preparedness for unforeseen developments as well as strategies for dealing with unexpected surprises.

AB Living apart together A long-lasting alternative? The impact of occupational positions and partnership-related expectations on staying in a partnership with separate households
   Based on data of the German Family Panel (N = 1118 respondents aged 25 to 39), this study explores different types of individuals in comparatively long-lasting partnerships with separate households ("living apart together", LAT). A cluster analysis considering occupational positions and partnership-related expectations, in conjunction with subsequent longitudinal event history analyses, suggests that need for autonomy exerts a negative effect on the transition rate into cohabitation. Respondents in long-distance relationships show a higher transition rate into cohabitation and a lower risk of a separation than expected. Job-related mobility seems to be less relevant for the consolidation and stability of partnerships with separate households than a precarious job situation characterized by unemployment and low income.

ID SECULARIZATION
AB Religious Change in Consumer Society
   Does the increasing proliferation of consumption opportunities changes the social routine activities of individuals, and thereby reduces attendance rates at religious services? Following Durkheim, religion provides symbols, rites and collective representations that enable individuals to act socially. By providing a range of socio-cultural-related products, services and infrastructures (trend sports, bars, holiday resorts, theme parks, shopping malls, museums), the market incrementally fulfills similar functions - that is, it enables individuals to engage socially -, and thereby supplants traditional religion as the central medium to reproduce social relations. The paper uses a sample of young German Catholics from the Socio-economic Panel Study (1984-2009) applying bivariate and multilevel-regression analyses. Results indicate that with waxing income, respondents increasingly engage in consumption-related leisure activities, while attendance rates at religious services significantly decrease.

DT Article
AB Board level Co-Determination as arrangement of politics and economy Current research regards Co-Determination either as a political or as an economical issue. This article proposes to understand Co-Determination as a problem of different logical spaces (contextures) in organisational decision-making. While employee representatives care about the legitimacy of a decision, shareholder representatives observe the scarcity of resources and efficiency. The paper asks how these different logics are arranged in decision-making. A case study that focuses on framing processes shows, that this arrangement may be reached by de-linking different settings. While the official board meetings are economically framed, meetings of the employee representatives are framed politically. A connection between both is established by informal agreements between the head of employee representatives and the chairman. It allows a compromise that can be presented in both settings as economically rational as well as a political success.

SO SOZIALE WELT-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIALWISSENSCHAFTLICHE FORSCHUNG UND
   PRAXIS
LA German
DT Article
AB Following the differentiation between orthodox and heterodox knowledge, the essay postulates the existence of a within our order of knowledge well hidden shadow knowledge, which in its totality shall be denoted by the newly introduced term of cryptodoxy. This cryptodox knowledge is secluded monodirectionally against the valid reality order: From these shadowspheres in the normal case no knowledge is leaking outside. As this shielding also hinders every sociology of knowledge investigation, the existence of such shadow zones can only be verified by exemplary cases, in which the respective bodies of knowledge were part of this cryptodoxy for a while, which however are not anymore today. Subsequent to four, in such a sense necessarily 'historical' examples, two different processes of the development of shadow zones and the resulting forms of cryptodox knowledge are presented: The tabooing and the formation of clandestine patterns of interpretation. They have in common, that the cryptodox knowledge is always prevailing in the modus of the reflexive secret knowledge, which necessitates special mechanisms of knowledge transfer. Such, still quite theoretically oriented discussions refer to an outstanding empirical research program on cryptodoxy from the perspective of the sociology of knowledge. Only its realization will show how sustainable the impulses for a more profound exploration of our reality order namely its constitutional mechanisms and drawing of boundaries are, which can be generated by the new sociology of knowledge category.

LA German
DT Article
AB Though disposable time forms an important aspect of people's well being and opportunities, it is for a large part neglected in sociological research on inequality. Existing studies show evidence that time constraints are in many respects structured alongside gender and job inequalities. Women and unskilled workers face particular strong risks and disadvantages. It is the leading question of this article, whether life-course oriented approaches to working-time organisation are able to reduce these inequalities by creating better ways for employees to adapt their working time to their changing needs over the life course. Empirical examples of working-life time accounts are used to examine the extent to which women and workers in lower occupational positions are equally able to save up time and realize paid leaves for training, care, and better work-life balance. Based on transaction cost theory hypotheses on the utilization of working-life time accounts are derived. Logistic and linear regression analyses show evidence that working-life time accounts depend on sufficient individual resources with regard to time, income, and employment security. In this respect they rather enhance than diminish existing gender and job inequalities over the life course.

AB Concentrating on social background and former mobility experiences, determinants of the international mobility of students and recent graduates are defined drawing on the microeconomic human capital model. The logistic regression analyses are based on data of the Bavarian Graduate Survey. Results imply that international mobility both during the studies and upon entrance into the labor market is significantly influenced by the social background. In addition to this direct effect, the higher likelihood of students and recent graduates with a favorable social background to experience mobility in early stages also increases their propensity to go abroad again. Furthermore, an ordinal logistic regression analysis shows that the same is true for the radius considered when searching for a job. Based on these empirical results and search theoretic arguments it is subsequently argued that the social selectivity of international experiences contributes to the reproduction of inequality in the field of the highly qualified.

AB Survey data is prone to error which could result from different sources. One important source of error, more specifically of bias, is deliberate misreporting on sensitive questions due to social desirability concerns. The article presents theoretical explanations of social desirability bias and discusses methods to reduce social desirability bias in sensitive surveys. Literature on empirical social research often recommends either positive 'loading' of sensitive questions, e.g. using 'forgiving' wording, or choosing a permissive question context to encourage interviewees to answer more honestly. However, only few attempts to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of these recommendations can be found in the experimental literature. Based on theories of cognitive dissonance, we derive explanations how manipulations of question wording and context could elicit more socially undesirable answers in sensitive surveys. In an experimental survey (4 randomized groups, online data collection with access-panel, n=1176), we evaluate the effects of (1) 'forgiving'-wording and (2) question context on social desirability bias in different sensitive questions. The empirical evidence on the assumed social desirability bias-reducing effect of 'forgiving' wording and permissive question context shows mixed results. Alternative explanations of social desirability bias are discussed and empirically tested. We show that the perceived social norm has the strongest and most consistent effect on respondents' willingness to self-report socially undesirable behavior.

ID MOTIVATION; VARIABLES
AB This paper analyses the influence of cultural capital on friendship among students. Many studies have already shown a positive relationship between cultural capital and educational success. However, little attention has been given to what extent cultural capital matters for friendship formation among students in the same school class. Following Bourdieu, this paper assumes cultural capital as a bundle of codes of behavior and attitudes that lead to socially homogeneous forms of friendship. We test our hypotheses using network data from about 200 students from nine classes of secondary schools in Germany. As a result students are more likely to be friends with each other, the more similar their social origin is and the more similar their parents' homes are equipped with cultural capital.

   Restrain Companies in the Pursuit of their Economic Interests

AB Do people behave in accordance with moral norms because they want to or because they are forced to do so? This question is ultimately irresolvable, as the "real" motivations of individuals are hidden from scientific analysis. This article carves out the mechanism of "argumentative coercion" that circumvents this problem. The basic conception is that company managements publicly justify their actions by referring to widely accepted values and social norms. This might reflect real moral scruple, or they might only do so pro forma, to satisfy social demands. Regardless of this, such legitimations develop a momentum of their own. Justifications might simply have been made to immunize self-interested actions against a critical public. Nonetheless, they can be used to hold actors accountable to their initial promises. Thus, as our first case study tries to illustrate, the question of whether people act morally because they want to do so or because they are made to act morally loses some of its pertinence. Our second case study shows that argumentative coercion also exists because costs are incurred upon actors if these do not justify their actions with widely accepted social norms. This mechanism of "argumentative coercion" helps to explain how trade unions and works councils influence companies over which they cannot exert much formal power.

LA German
DT Article
AB In mass media, demographically shrinking communes have come to be regarded as a social problem. But how exactly does local population decline cause comunal problems and what can be done about them? Based on expert interviews in East Germany, West Germany, and Poland it can be shown that different institutional contexts set demographic changes with a specific relevance for municipal decision making. The lower population-dependency of municipal revenues and expansive political programs in West Germany and Poland resolve the often-assumed positive relationship between population decline and municipal decision-making. However in East Germany such a relationship seems to be the case. Nevertheless, it cannot be explained with reference to the population discourse. Rather, it appears more plausible to emphasize path dependent institutional conditions after the reunification with West Germany (high participation rates in institutional child care and an broken down economy) which made expansive solutions rather impossible.

ID SOCIAL NETWORKS; UNEMPLOYMENT; MODELS; PANEL
AB This contribution investigates the relation between the number of associations in Germany's 413 regions and several indicators of their economic and social wealth. As indicators of wealth we use the regions' gross domestic product per capita, the unemployment rate, the participation in the last national election, and crime rates. The analyses are based on our own data collection of the number of associations registered at the 398 local courts. Furthermore, we use the official statistical data about regions' population density, age structure, and educational enrollment. Overall, we counted 554'394 registered associations which are heterogeneously spread over the country. Our statistical analyses control for spatial dependencies. We find a strong correlation between the number of associations within regions and their GDP. However, there was no connection found between number of associations and unemployment rates, electoral participation, or crime rates. Our analyses use for the first time rather accurate and reliable information about the number of associations in a region.

The results from our regression analysis are the following: First, foreigners in self-employment are found to earn more than foreigners in a regular employment position. Second, foreigners seem to gain more from self-employment compared to German entrepreneurs. Also, the earnings increase from self-employment is larger for foreigners than it is for Germans. The findings are discussed from a policy and an entrepreneurship education perspective.

AB Modifying M. Granovetters distinction between strong and weak tie friendships, social assimilation of immigrant children will be investigated from a social network perspective. Using data from primary school classes we start from the assumption that particularly close friendships have a positive impact on the process of acculturation. We investigate the role of ethnic homophily in the formation of weak and close friendships between immigrant and native children. In doing so, alternative explanations of friendship formation like social homophily as a mediator of ethnic homophily will be considered measured by similarity of ego and alter in terms of cultural capital "in the objectified state". As a result, immigrant children of Turkish origin have friendships with native peers, but these connections tend to be rather weak tie relations. Dyads of two Turkish children, in contrast, chances of close friendships are higher. It will be argued that these results are in line with the concept of selective acculturation of immigrant children of Turkish origin.

AB In this contribution, for the first time in Germany macro-structural restrictions on partner choice are described on a regional basis. Based on Blau's structural theory and taking into account the central dimensions of partner choice such as age, education, and availability for the marriage market, indicators for the macro-structural marriage market are constructed using data on German counties' population in 2004, regional results of the sample census from 2003 to 2005, and results from the German family survey 2000. The results indicate that macro-structural conditions of partner choice depend on regional differences in fertility, on a regional dispersion of gender-specific educational success, and on gender-specific motives for migration.

AB In the course of the Bologna process", the German system of higher education was significantly restructured by introducing bachelor and master degrees. Although a selection of the best bachelor graduates to enter master programs was intended the transition rates are at a very high level in general. This study focuses for the first time in detail on the transition behavior of nearly 700 bachelor graduates of a German university. Several hypotheses on social selection processes and on the role of gender are tested. Approximately three of four bachelor graduates enter a master program directly after completing their bachelor degree. Multivariate analyses confirm that the educational background of the graduates is influential: There is a nine percentage point difference in the transition rates of graduates from a lower educational family background compared to graduates with at least one parent with a university degree. Primary effects of social background as differences in grades are not detected, however there is evidence that graduates from a lower educational family background do not acquire additional elements of qualification as participation in exchange programs with universities abroad and internships closely related to their field of study. The lower transition of female graduates is completely explained by sex segregation of fields of study.

AB German higher education was considered to be elite education until the Second World War. Yet afterwards its character changed and through its expansion higher education transformed into mass education. Since the late 1990 s developments have been taking place that intend to implement a differentiation between "elite" and "regular" education within the German higher education sector. This paper analyses so-called "elite study programs" and "intensive study programs" and examines the normative orientations implied by these programs.

AB Within dual earner households women and men often experience mobility conflicts if one person intends to change workplace that appears distantly located. In effect a typical dilemma arises: Is the common household going to move or should the one who changed workplace commute? Using action theory, this paper analyses such a situation by examining two people with similar bargaining power. The dilemma - so the theoretical claim - can only be solved if one of the two partners steps back from his or her preferences of mobility. The reasons for stepping back are closely related to social norms. Using a factorial survey we identified the active norms the partners used to solve the mobility dilemma. Probands evaluated the fairness of different mobility solutions. It was found that test subjects did not tend to evaluate these potential changes along traditional societal means. But if there are little children in the household men and woman evaluate according to the social norm that childcare is women's work and it is unfair if women should bear the cost of commuting.

ID PUNISHMENT; FAIRNESS
AB The emergence of social order (e.g. cooperation) is central to sociological thought. Although the creation of a system of cooperation is possible in a group of rational and selfish actors, recent experimental evidence supports the classical sociological view that an internalized norm of reciprocity contributes to the maintenance of social order. When sharing goods, subjects behave reciprocally even when no strategic advantage can be gained. This article presents findings from an experimental study testing whether reciprocity norms exist among eleven-year old primary school children in sequential dictator games as well as sequential taking games. Player 2 generally reciprocates player l's friendly behavior even when there are no repercussions for ignoring players l's overture, and taking the full available reward. This finding supports the thesis that altruistic reciprocity contributes to the stability of social relations.

AB Populism has engendered intense debates due to the threat it may pose to representative democracies. The purpose of this article is to examine and evaluate the scientific meaning of populism that avoids a 'policy style' of analysis. After a brief overview of older approaches of populism, the paper presents a critical discussion of current typologies of populism. Three different definitions of populism are examined: Populism as 1) ideology, 2) political power strategy, and 1) discursive practice. It is argued that generic definitions of populism are either too abstract or focus mainly on Latin American cases. Research on populism is mainly limited to political party analysis whereas this paper draws upon the research of charismatic leadership and elites. Finally, it suggests hermeneutical approaches for a populism research agenda.

AB In a longitudinal study of former German high school students between age 15 and 43 it is shown that teachers evaluations with prognostic claims may influence the students' educational decisions by shaping their success expectations. Initially false teacher evaluations may work like a 'self-fulfilling prophecy' in the sense of Merton (1948). Because of the path dependency and cumulation of educational and occupational career processes they still indirectly affect the occupational prestige at the age of 43. Finally, the following analysis offers prospects in terms of fruitfully connecting the longitudinal perspective of life course research to the action-theoretical perspective of a theory of subjective expected utility.

AB After two decades of reforming the system of higher education in accordance with the principles of New,Public Management (NPM) time has come to evaluate the actual outcomes of this process on a national scale. Based on well documented knowledge on the impact of the managerial governance on research performance, this article focuses on possible impacts of performance-oriented steering mechanisms (pay-for-performance, performance related budgeting, Management by Objectives and teaching awards) on academic teaching. Do selective incentives, as they are recommended by NPM and its theoretical underpinning (principal-agent theory), really help to overcome the alleged professors' shirking? To provide answers we first developed theory-driven hypotheses and enriched the axiomatic of economic theorizing on organizations with a cultural-cognitive perspective. Then, we tested our theoretical consideration with the help of data from a survey among 1,119 German university professors. The purpose is to capture 'academic production' at the micro-level of organizing universities. Regression analyses show no direct effects of managerial steering tools on self-reported teaching behavior. However, we can confirm the hypotheses on cultural schemes of perception beyond economic explanations of interests (intrinsic teaching motivation, teaching approach, gender). At last, general differences in attitudes (e.g. teaching motivation, acceptance of managerial governance) can be shown between the groups of professors paid in the old salary system and those who are subjected to pay-for-performance.

AB The lifestyles of young people are shaped by forms of collectivization (milieu) which are strongly based on musical taste. It is often assumed that in some musical youth milieus, deviant or even delinquent behavior is more common than in other and that some milieus are characterized by special forms of such behavior (e. g. spraying graffiti in the hip-hop scene). The presented analysis is based on three data sets of a German school survey in Munster (2003) and Duisburg (2003, 2005) and explores the musical tastes as well as crime rates in the secondary school. With the help of Latent Class Analyses the adolescents are classified on the basis of their musical preferences. The so found typologies are being described with the help of further lifestyle characteristics and examined regarding their crime rates. As a result, classes with a wide spread musical preference for Techno and House and a simultaneous rejection of all other music styles show higher rates of alcohol and drug rates. Classes with preferences for Hip-Hop and Rap and simultaneous rejection of all other music styles have higher crime rates. The results for the classes with preferences for Blues, Jazz and classical music are not as clear but still, strong hints of lower crime rates can be found here.

AB Employment conditions and career perspectives at universities are of central importance for sociological research and higher education policy. However, the perspective of organizational sociology is lacking so far. Consequently, the specificity of the university as a formal organization has to be considered. Based on Luhmann's distinction between 'organizational power' and 'personnel power' (Quote), we show that both sources of power in organizations can hardly be found at German universities. Unlike business firms, the membership of the individual is not at the organization's disposal (lack of "organizational power"). Unlike public administrations, the single university organization can hardly offer distinct career tracks and opportunities (lack of "personnel power"). In this, we see specific limits to the use of new managerial instruments at universities. We discuss these limits against the background of both organizational sociology and new public management research. In addition, comparative perspectives concerning other national higher education systems are highlighted.

LA German
DT Article
ID CONSTRUCTION
AB The article presents findings from a discourse analysis of the German science council's research rating based on textual material published by the science council. The research rating is interpreted as a practice of governing science that aims at a systematic restructuring of scientist's and scientific organization's self-assessment and thereby engenders a new form of scientific self-regulation. In this process, new criteria of scientific quality are introduced, e.g. efficiency, differentiation, internationality and applicability of standardized measurement. The technology of the panopticon and procedures of normalization are employed in this new practice of government. While recent analyses indicate trends toward "academic capitalism" and the "entrepreneurial university", two complementary processes are emphasized here: Practices of calculation, accounting and economization can only be applied if science is subjected to normalization; universities can only act according to entrepreneurial rationality if they are endowed with agent-like qualities.

ID FERTILITY PATTERNS; MARRIAGE; DECLINE; COUPLES; MARRY
AB The present study compares the nuptiality of East and West German women after the German unification, based on data from the Socioeconomic Panel (GSEOP). In the initial model, East German women exhibit a lower risk of first marriage than the West German sub-sample. Multivariate event history analyses suggest that two East German peculiarities account for this difference: first, particular socio-cultural orientations of East German women (e.g., their lower religiosity and their higher work aspirations), and second, consequences of the political transformation such as lower household incomes and a reduced global life satisfaction in East Germany. Complex findings result concerning both the transition to parenthood and to cohabitation. Although the odds of these transitions are generally higher in the East German sample, both events are less strongly linked to marriage in this subgroup. Surprisingly, the nuptiality of mobile women (i.e., those who have moved from East to West Germany after 1990) resembles the West German pattern, despite the fact that this group is characterised by a lower religiosity and by a slightly higher work orientation, compared to West German women.

ID INFLATED POISSON REGRESSION
AB The study contributes to the debate on the erosion of standard employment relationships. Based on the IAB-Establishment Panel we investigate under which conditions firms convert fixed-term contracts into permanent ones. On the one hand fixed-term contracts help to maintain an adequate relationship between stability and flexibility. In this case, conversion is less probable. On the other hand fixed-term contracts are used in the context of recruiting. In this case, the bargaining position between the contracting parties plays a major role. In firms with problems in hiring qualified employees, conversions are more probable. In the mainly public and non-profit social service establishments fixed-term contracts are predominantly used to maintain flexibility. High proportions of fixed-term contracts are accompanied by low conversion rates. In the production sector fixed-term employees are rather used as a recruiting instrument. In general, the results indicate that international competition is not directly responsible for the rise of fixed-term contracts.

AB The fact that attractive people have more professional success than unattractive people is broadly documented in the social psychological literature. It has not been examined yet, however, if the success of attractive people is also based on a better performance. It is possible that attractive people achieve success with less effort than unattractive people as they are usually better treated by their social environment. The question is how a person's performance is influenced by his or her attractiveness. As the performance of professional football players can be measured rather simply and is comparatively well documented, we examined the 483 professional players of the 18 teams playing in the German premier league in 2007 and 2008 to answer this question. Each player's attractiveness was measured using the Truth of Consensus Method by averaging the attractiveness ratings obtained from an online survey based on portrait photographs. The players' performance was measured observing playing habits in detail. The statistical evaluation shows that a player's attractiveness tends to influence his performance negatively. This effect, however, depends on the players' attractiveness within his team: a high and homogenous attractiveness of all players in a team reverses the direction of the effect of attractiveness on performance.

AB Research on transnational migration and transnational social spaces becomes an increasingly important research field. Based on the educational, housing and work trajectories of 648 Mexican labour migrants that had worked at least once in the Metropolitan region of New York City and examining qualitative fieldwork and biographical interviews new migration pattern of transnational migrants have been observed. These migrants commute many times between the two countries with stays lasting several years. They cannot be considered as 'failed immigrants' or 'return migrants'. Rather, their contexts of migration unravel dense transnational family networks. The data analysis explains the number of country shifts by variables related to personal, family, time and work characteristics of the surveyed migrants. The findings are crucial for understanding new processes of international migration and incorporation and for developing adequate means for recognizing and integrating transnational migrants.

AB Since the German parental leave reform from January 2007, the share of fathers who took up parental leave in the course of 2007 rose substantially However, fathers in parental leave still represent a minority. In this paper, we analyze the effects of the German parental leave reform on the decision of fathers to take up parental leave As a result of our empirical analysis which is based on an online survey of 1,290 fathers, we can see that the German parental leave reform has indeed significantly increased a father's propensity to take up parental leave. At the same time, however, the average duration of parental leave has decreased as fathers predominantly take advantage of the so called "fathers' months". In our analysis we control for a range of potential determinants on a father's decision to take up parental leave and include variables from the fathers' professional and social background as well as variables reflecting the fathers' personality. Concerning the influence of other determinants on a father's decision to take up parental leave, we find tentative evidence of the German parental leave reform having dampened the Influence of formerly powerful determinants of a father's decision (not) to take up parental leave (such as a father's income in relation to the one of the mother or a father's degree of extraversion) while other, formerly less important determinants apparently have gained in importance in the course of the reform (e g the time strain fathers experience in their job and a father's degree of agreeableness).

AB In this article, the authors focus on the connections between political events and their reporting in the mass media, based upon hearing protocols and press reports, respectively In order to gain some insight into the rules and mechanism at the heart of the publication processes, we compare press reports on three political inquiries the German Visa committee, the Hutton Inquiry in the UK, and the CIA-committee at the European Parliament. Along the lines of an empirical constructivism, we argue that media publication processes achieve certain transfers, these are already implied in the organization of the political events in question Highlighting three aspects of publication (reality markers, ways of quoting, and media autonomization), we show how the publications become successively removed from the events, finally feeding Into further media discourse. Thus, even those quotes and sound bites eventually achieving far-reaching circulation have undergone a history of adjustment and supersession

AB A vast body of literature shows that social networks/contacts can overcome information problems in labor markets and help jobseekers. However, only a few studies investigate the role of social networks (employee referrals) from the complementary perspective of organizations. In a first step, we give an overview of the current status of research and focus on studies that take into account recruitment activities of a single organization Such studies (based on a whole applicant pool) have the advantage that Information about organizational characteristics as well as about all successful and non-successful applicants are available on each stage in the recruitment process In a second step, we present an empirical study referring to the applicant pool (between February and April 2007, N=477) of a German company in the textile sector (with online distribution of products) Multivariate analyses show that, controlling for human capital, employee referrals pay off at the single stages in the recruitment process ('better match' with regard to the 'transmission of the application to a specialty department', the 'job-interview stage', and the 'job-offer stage'). Our study also points to specific potentials of single-organization studies such as determining the location of (unintended) discrimination

AB The questions at the heart of this introductory chapter are the following: How can social and political theory be opened up, theoretically as well as methodologically and empirically, to a historically new, entangled Modernity which threatens its own foundations? How can it account for the fundamental fragility, the mutability of societal dynamics (of unintended side effects, domination and power), shaped by the globalization of capital and risks at the beginning of the twenty-first century? What does "methodological nationalism" mean and how can its problems be addressed in empirical research? In the following, we will develop this "cosmopolitan turn" in social theory and research in four steps: firstly, we present the major conceptual tools for a theory of cosmopolitan modernities; secondly, we de-construct Western modernity by using examples taken from research on individualization and risk; thirdly, we address the key problem of "methodological cosmopolitanism", namely the problem of defining the appropriate unit of analysis; and finally, we discuss perspectives and dilemmas of a theory of cosmopolitan modernities, in particular problems of political agency and prospects of political realization.

AB The individualization of relationships refers to the situation in which a leeway is allowed for the intervention of individuals making choices on their own in developing and maintaining relationships. Two types of discourses on relationships were generated: one is the "liberation" discourse that ties the individualization of relationships to individual self-realization and the demonstration of individuality, and the other is the "deprivation" discourse that ties the individualization of relationships to the weakened state of existing relationships. In this paper, we investigate which the aspects - "liberation" or "deprivation" - appear in family, company and local communities. We found that even though the Japanese are positive about living an individual life free from family and corporate relationships in the context of "liberation", in order to deal with the risks of "deprivation", they easily resort to family members and corporate community that formerly controlled or bound them.

SO SOZIALE WELT-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIALWISSENSCHAFTLICHE FORSCHUNG UND
   PRAXIS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper examines individualization from the perspective of transnational marriage as a concrete historical tendency in Korea today. Transnational marriage involves global risks, individualization and cosmopolitan change identified by Beck as three major driving forces of second modernity. The research questions asked in this paper include: First, how do global risks work as a driving force pushing the state and the individuals toward transnational marriage? Second, how has the process of transnational marriage taken place on both the institutional and the individual level? Third, what are the salient characteristics of the relationship between individual and family in transnational marriages? To sharpen analytic foci, conceptual distinctions have been made between the objective-structural and the cultural-discursive dimensions as well as between push and pull factors of the transformation. The central claim we have developed in this paper is double-front: on the one hand, individualization in Korea seen from transnational marriage tends to converge with the Western pattern insofar as we see this from an eye of push factors of global significance. On the other, due to the difference in pull factors particularly at the cultural-discursive level, individualization does not proceed in the way as found in the West, but it rather encompasses a delicate, culture-bound balance between individual and family community. The concept of 'family-oriented individualization' embraces the aspects of dynamic balance between individualization and reactivating community as a dual process of historical change in East Asia.

LA English
DT Article
ID PERSPECTIVE
AB It is commonly perceived that the 'globalization of science' may result in a 'Westernization of science'. In this paper, however, I use the case of stem cell science in China to demonstrate that developing countries are sometimes able to effectively shape the norms of global / local scientific exchange. Based on interviews with 38 stem cell scientists in six Chinese cities in early 2008, this paper elucidates Chinese scientists' outlook towards cross-border collaborations and the effects that the internationalization of science has had on everyday laboratory operations. Findings suggest that although there still exists an asymmetry of scientific influence, and in many aspects China is still 'catching-up' to the West, there is also a changing nature of communication beyond borders. One key aspect of recent international scientific development is the growing necessity for local stakeholders to acquire a global mindset and to compare, reflect and accommodate diverse interests. This is what 1 define as the 'cosmopolitization of science'. The study empirically examines the sociological and methodological implications of the cosmopolitization process and further develops Ulrich Beck's cosmopolitan theory by delineating four main features of the 'cosmopolitization of science': shared future benefits, passive ethicization, reflexive negotiation, and continuous performance.

ID INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION
AB Cosmopolitanism is the focus of much current debate. This literature is marked by a relative paucity of detailed research examining cosmopolitanism as a social force within particular societies. Two topics that have received little attention despite their utter importance for current global challenges are the scale and impact of cosmopolitanism in China and the significance of low carbon innovation'. This paper explores both on the basis of over 70 interviews with parties involved in low-carbon innovation, a field particularly propitious for cosmopolitan motivation. We argue that there is distinct evidence of cosmopolitanism in China but this is relatively fragile and an elite development, despite China's increasingly deep integration into global networks and flows. Furthermore, the cosmopolitanism in evidence is a distinctly Chinese version, thereby offering important lessons regarding the nature of cosmopolitanism per se and the reciprocal challenge of China to the existing cosmopolitanism of the global North.

ID CURRENT ISSUES; PROFESSIONALS
AB Sociology's nomothetic approach aims at general insights by comparing a large number of cases which are placed in a large context. The sociological approach is advantageous for observing non-intentional and non-politicized effects of contexts on cases. As a side-effect of this approach specifics of case and context are often neglected. The fact that cases are mostly placed in the nation state context alone is highly problematic. The research program of methodological cosmopolitanism proposes a different manner of constructing cases and contexts and of situating cases in contexts. Drawing on methods and concepts of ethnographic and comparative research, the article suggests situating cases in multiple contexts (among others e.g. transnational social fields or postcolonial spaces). Comparisons should be designed in a manner which enables us to empirically understand the extent and ways in which the nation state (system) impacts on cases. Ideal types of research designs which go "beyond" the nation state frame are discussed on the basis of the author's research on highly skilled migration.

ID ATTRACTION; EXPOSURE; NETWORKS; CORE
AB The study examines the structural aspects of the mating process with focus on opportunities rather than preferences of individual actors. It is argued that the higher educated are to a lesser degree able to rely on informal, institution-independent networks in the meeting process. Geographical mobility and altered sociability styles result in a crowding-out of informal, lifeworld-generated mechanisms of social association. This assumption is tested with the biographical data of the German Youth Institute family survey 2000 by means of multinomial event history analysis. Results show, that the higher educated are to a stronger degree dependent on the inclusion in formal organizations (especially educational institutions) that produce marriage-markets as byproducts of other functions. In lifecycle periods where they cannot rely on institutionally generated opportunities, the probabilities to establish new intimate relations are significantly reduced (in comparison to the lower educated in the same situation). It can also be shown that this diminished probability of mating is the outcome of reduced transitivity within the informal networks of higher educated mobile individuals.

AB Human Capital Theory is the dominating approach to explain individual wage differences. Consequently, the available stock of human capital in general and of the educational level in particular is the central characteristic for individual labour market success respectively the amount of wages. Accordingly, differences of wages can be justified on the basis of productivity differences arising as a result from unequal educational qualifications. However, the Status Attainment Theory postulates a close relationship between social origin, individual education and personal labour market success. Accordingly, the social status of the parents affects the formal educational qualification of children, which in turn influences the vocational status and therefore the wages. At the same time, social origin can have a direct effect on earnings. Against this background this paper investigates the relevance of social origin for educational success with special focus on the labour market success in Germany and Switzerland. It is argued that both countries show similarities concerning the relation between social origin, education and income.

AB Many scholars approach pension restructuring in terms of neoliberalism and class conflict, suggesting that pension restructuring is reducible to a linear and one-dimensional process. This article argues that this limits the scope for understanding pension restructuring and thus limits our capacity to understand and uncover new possibilities and collective solutions, albeit capitalized solutions. This article attempts to enrich our understanding of pension restructuring by approaching it through the lens of reflexive modernization, or second modernity, where the institutions of first modernity undergo modernization themselves and where strict boundary demarcations are eroded. The article then theorizes the prospects of a collective resurgence in pension provision utilizing neoinstitutionalist theories of institutional design in conjunction with a case study of a new multiemployer German pension scheme. Ultimately, it is argued that past institutional legacies can be maneuvered to produce a collective response to the liberalized and market-oriented environment of pension provision, suggesting that individualization has limits.

ID PUBLIC SOCIOLOGY
AB The research rating of sociology, carried out and published in 2008 by an evaluation group as a pilot study on behalf of the German Science Council, is expected to distinguish itself by higher quality and multi-dimensionality compared to ordinary rankings. This article will show that this procedure of evaluation itself faces considerable problems in doing justice to the varied reality of research and building valid and reliable indicators of research activities. The research rating itself selectively constructs sociological excellence, which would look quite different if measured in other ways. A thus far open field of equally licensed participants in discourse is subjected to stratification, which tends towards self-reproduction, because acquired competitive advantages can be turned into further advantages. Hence, sociology moves farther away than before from the ideal speech situation. The evolution of sociological knowledge is closed by increasing subjection to power structures.

ID COMMUNICATION
AB In this paper I apply the concept of micropolitics, as derived from organizational sociology, on the sociology of expertise. From such a perspective, manufacturing expertise within an interdisciplinary team always entails bargaining over the relevance and robustness of particular disciplinary knowledge. Taking the example of national ethics councils, I demonstrate that the micropolitics of knowledge determines the success of claiming an expert status. I argue that the ethical framing of this expertise does not privilege the specialised knowledge of professional ethicists. Rather, it leads to a marginalization of ethical expertise. Paradoxically, the trend towards ethicizing scientific-technical phenomena on the macro level goes along with a marginalization of ethics on the micro level.

   PRAXIS
LA German
DT Article
AB Comprehensive schools and all-day schools aim for different aspects of equality of opportunity, namely equalizing or providing opportunities. Using population surveys, I show how respective knowledge and evaluation of comprehensive schools and of all-day schools have developed in Germany. Unlike all-day schools, the knowledge of comprehensive schools appears to be politically selective. Only those who know the repective school form have been evaluated. Three hypotheses are tested in relation to control for attitudes to equality of opportunity, political self-identification, social status, and parenthood. According to the competition hypothesis, the evaluation of comprehensive schools should have declined in West Germany between 1979 and 2005; it is verified. According to the egalitarianism hypothesis, comprehensive schools should receive less support in West than in East Germany in 2005; it is verified for comprehensive schools only. According the difference hypothesis could be verified that comprehensive schools are getting less support than all-day schools in both parts of Germany in 2005. While competing with the traditional three-partite secondary school system, comprehensive schools lose support, because they postpone the distribution of opportunities, which the higher forms of the traditional school system provide immediately after.

DT Article

AB This paper analyses how the presence of children and the spouse's employment status relates to the desire for more and fewer hours of work. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), it is argued that a majority of employees do not work the working hours they would prefer. Most employees who are facing a mismatch of working hours want to spend less time at work. The desire to increase or decrease working hours varies greatly with the family structure. Mothers are more likely to have an unmet desire for fewer hours than women without children, whereas fathers less often express the desire for fewer hours than childless men. Those groups of workers who are most liable to work-life conflicts, such as single mothers and fathers in dual-earner households, relatively unlikely show a desire for fewer hours of work. The analysis suggests that work-life conflict is only weakly related to work hour mismatches. In addition, it became visible that the association between work-life conflict and the desire to reduce working hours is mediated by the family income and social norms.

LA German
DT Article
ID TRANSFORMATION
AB Measures of reorganisation create in-company competition: strategies, structures, and processes are constantly put to test whether they are successful or are forced to change. This competitive principle can be interpreted with reference to Schumpeter's theorem of "inward creative destruction". Organizational change renders the organization itself an object of creative destruction and opens it for permanent adjustment to changing environments without simply giving up proven patterns of action. Empirical findings on organizational change (including the results from a comprehensive empirical study on the success conditions of profound organizational change in large German companies) provide the diagnostic bedrock for successive theoretical interpretations of the competitive relationship and related problems of integration. These findings visualize a manifestation of integral competition, which can be observed not just in case of organizational change but in project work in general. The competitive working conditions of projects generate entrepreneurial energy in managers and employees and, at the same time, promote alignment towards shared objectives.

AB Bourdieu's theory of classes explains the reproduction of class structures along processes of intergenerational transmission of cultural capital and their manifestation in lifestyles. Against his approach, it has been argued that lifestyles and especially the reception of art, which is central to Bourdieu's theory, do not depend on the endowment of a person with cultural capital. This article sets out to test the relevance of cultural capital for art reception using the example of the perception of opera music. In contrast to most studies in this field, the presented research does not focus on the musical genres favored by persons, but on their reception and appreciation of them. Data on the endowment of persons with cultural capital as well as on their mode of listening to music were collected in an audience survey among opera visitors. The empirical results indicate that there are a greater number of forms of music reception than assumed in Bourdieu's theory of art perception with its focus on a decoding and analytical appreciation of art. However, the strength of the analytic mode of listening to music can be explained very well by the person's endowment with cultural capital.

DT Review
AB The paper describes the social form of the city with respect to the four different media epochs: tribal society (orality), ancient society (writing), modem society (print) and next society (computer and Internet). Starting with Max Weber's thesis that the city is the very form which enables people foreign to each other to nevertheless live with each other, the paper inquires into the structural and cultural function of the city in handling the "overflow of meaning" (Uberschusssinn, Niklas Luhmann) coming with any new medium of the distribution of communication. The unity of the difference of all four media epochs seems to be the city's employment with "empty places", which structure and cultivate urbanity as a space for preparation and handling of surprise. We are not used to speak of 'a city' with respect to tribal society, but as outlined here, its structure and culture did already exist, and we are able to witness the sites where "silent trades" are taking place. The empty places of the ancient city are 'houses' [oikoi], where private people make up their plans, which, in their consequences, have to be accounted for at the market place [agora]. In modem city the same function is fulfilled by functional planning, which is thwarted at any moment, but updated the very next. In 'next city' so called posses assume this function, tearing apart the web of the city, which knits the very next moment.

ID ELITE
AB The opinion about the internationalization and transnationalization of classes and elites is deeply divided. This article deals with such query on the basis of an empirical study about the nationality and the careers of top managers from economically most powerful European (Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy and Spain) and non-European countries (China, Japan and USA). The findings are evident. Only every twentieth top manager is of foreign origin and only every fourth local top manager has ever studied or worked. abroad. More than two years, even just one out of seven local top managers has lived abroad. Even just one out of seven local top managers has lived abroad for more than two years. The main reason for this is the hegemony of traditional national career types. The inter- and transnationalization of the business elites proceeds a lot more slowly than many sociologists and economists suppose. But there are great differences between the several countries. The process is most advanced in Germany and Great Britain. In France by contrast, it even reverses in the younger generation.

LA German
DT Article
AB Anthropology and sociology are both challenged by globalisation. Supposedly self-sustaining peoples are rapidly disappearing, and attempts to conceptualize "society" within the parameters of the nation-state have proven themselves unfeasible. It is time to (re)consider the two disciplines that both took shape in the nineteenth century. Can 'culture' still serve as a bridge concept? Sociologists like Andreas Reckwitz have argued in favour of a discourse- and practise-oriented conception of culture, one, however, that entails difficulties of its own, as it leads to the complete culturalization of the social. Anthropologists such as Adam Kuper or Chris Hann, on the other hand, believe the concept of culture to be so reified, diffuse and blind to power relations that they would rather abandon it completely, or "sociologize" it by a more precise delineation of the symbolic codes and social practices to which it is intended to refer. The present contribution tends to side with the scepticists. From this perspective it retraces the most significant milestones of "desociologization" the classical anthropological concept of culture. Finally, it presents more recent anthropological approaches that reconceptualize culture as an arena crosscut by power relations, in which culture is the object of negotiation.

TI The New Production of Governing Knowledge Education Research in England

ID POLICY
AB This article draws on critical discourse analysis (CDA) to explore the extent to which there is an interdependence between new governing forms, often characterised as 'post-bureaucratic' and new knowledge forms, that are often described in terms of 'mode 2' knowledge that is, knowledge that combines the academy, the state and the private sector in co-production. The discussion is based on the analysis of a large number of policy texts concerned with education research as well as scrutiny of academic literature on research policy in England from 1945 to the present. Much recent policy and academic discourse, we suggest, characterises new knowledge forms as socially-responsive, and as potentially democratising knowledge, because of their apparent interactive, iterative, problem-focused and trans-disciplinary character. We suggest that such an analysis is insufficiently attentive to the discourse of the knowledge economy, and the related (discursive) turn in new knowledge production towards governing knowledge.

TI Ignorance Produces Knowledge. "Specified Ignorance" and
   Knowledge-Substitution Mechanisms in the Mirror of the Hungarian Health
   and Education Policies
SO SOZIALE WELT-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIALWISSENSCHAFTLICHE FORSCHUNG UND
   PRAXIS
LA German
DT Article
AB In an era of post-bureaucratic regulation, transnationalisation and "evidence-based policies", the appeal for change and reform in any policy domain is always a plea for research and expertise (both national and international). Knowledge and cognitive authority legitimize public policies. "Evidence" is often lacking, though. This text examines the ways in which formal, institutionalised scientific-bureaucratic evidence is replaced by other types of evidence, esp. transnational, social scientific, personal, stakeholders' and local knowledge, as well as by what we call incarnated-charismatic knowledge. They (and others) can serve in given, sociologically observable circumstances as substitute-evidence, filling the legitimacy gap. They appear when the rational-legal form of political domination is challenged or a "feeling of ignorance" related to a given policy issue emerges. Therefore decision-makers need to mobilise alternative sources of evidence to know and to govern. Specified ignorance in policy stands in focus of my political agnatology and anthropology of knowledge: its construction and miseen-scene, i.e. the substitution of formal, scientific-bureaucratic State knowledge by alternative data processing methods and heteronomic (substitute) knowledge-forms in two contemporary Hungarian policy domains. These forms seem, in particular circumstances and for particular actors, more tangible or reliable, and, above all, more "authentic" and more legitimate. Political non-knowledge (specified ignorance) contributes to the emergence of postnational multilocal knowledge.

TI Knowledge and Volition. The Production of Knowledge in Political
   Decision-Making
SO SOZIALE WELT-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIALWISSENSCHAFTLICHE FORSCHUNG UND
   PRAXIS
LA German
DT Article
AB Political action simultaneously seems to be vital and defective. Without non-political input, political decisions can not be made and at the same time scientific facts appear nearly irrelevant concerning the results of decision processes. The implicit assumption of a lack of knowledge in political practice is inherent in most studies about consulting political decision-makers. In contrast we will argue that political actors must not be regarded as simple users of knowledge but as producers of knowledge of the political field. We emphasize that restrictions of what can be politically said or done is primarily regulated by internal forms of constructing political knowledge. Not following a usual reading, We suggest that interest and antagonistic positions shall not be treated as boundary conditions of political decisions, but as subjects of political knowledge emerging in political decisions. In our case study "the imagined layperson", "the existing legal and institutional state of affaires" and "the politics of the parliamentary groups" of the Bavarian Landtag can be identified as constitutive elements of political knowledge about a governable world. Reluctant political decisions or the avoidance of "real" decisions usually provoke a criticism of the actor's obligation to serve their interests. Empirically it shows how strong a differentiated audience limits what can be said or done politically.
