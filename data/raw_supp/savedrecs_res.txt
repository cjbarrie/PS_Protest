AB This article addresses the constitution of financial subjectivities in Spain. It is part of a series of studies aimed at furthering knowledge of the financialisation of everyday life, a process that is redefining the lifecycles of individuals and forging new spaces for calculation and investment. Our work analyses this process, using the technique of the semi-structured in-depth interview. The discourse analysis, based on an analytical model of the concept of financial subjectivity, points to a lack of correspondence between the theoretical contributions concerning this concept and empirical findings. Respondents' economic behaviour was found to be only weakly financialised. A generalised lack of trust in the financial system, together with the predominance of public social welfare structures, discourage the use of financial investment as a means of protection against risk.

TI CROWDFUNDING AS DEMOCRATIC FINANCE? UNDERSTANDING HOW AND WHY UK
   INVESTORS TRUST THESE MARKETS
SO REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE SOCIOLOGIA
LA English
DT Article
DE Crowdfunding; Democracy; Finance; Investor Behaviour; Trust
ID SOCIAL VENTURES; CROWD; PARTICIPATION
AB Can crowdfunding contribute to the rebalancing of the financial system via democratising investment? This paper begins to respond to this question by establishing how and why investors place trust in these markets. We offer two contributions. First, to theoretical debates on democratic finance; and second, to a more empirical body of cross-disciplinary research into popular investment via a qualitative analysis of 52 original interviews with investors in six UK crowdfunding markets. Our data is taken from a project with the UK's Financial Conduct Authority to enhance investor protection in these markets. Deploying concepts from across economic sociology, we find that investors: mobilise embedded networks to establish trust in crowdfunding; are motivated by expectations of 'blended returns'; prefer automated investment tools if they lack experience; and typically invest with funds they have earmarked as being prepared to lose. We conclude that enhanced investor protection is required for crowdfunding to help democratise finance.

AB In this article, we employ a Veblenian framework to analyze three dimensions of corporate financialization: the expansion of the balance sheet, the rising importance of intangible assets and the growing levels of financial payouts. Our focus is the pharmaceutical sector, which is strongly dominated by a handful of large corporations known as Big Pharma. In our empirical analysis of the financial accounts of 27 of the largest global pharmaceutical corporations for the years 2000-2018, we find evidence of a shift in Big Pharma's business model from one focused on productive capacity (reflected by fixed capital and R&D) to one focused on intangible assets (reflected by patents, brands and goodwill). The modus operandi of Big Pharma is one which increasingly resembles that of a private equity fund which generates returns for shareholders that are supported by monopolized knowledge through intellectual property rights, capitalized future earnings potential and rising debt burdens. Our framework facilitates the study of the different elements of financialization and how they do (or do not) co-evolve over time, within and between industries, and between countries or global regions.

AB Financialisation is a structural and incomplete process of change in contemporary economies. The growth of the financial system in last few decades has been accompanied by an increasingly complex relationship between socio-economic actors and financial markets. In this paper we analyse the causes and consequences of financialisation regarding: an erosion of the capital-labour relationship; the rise of labour income inequality; and the marketization of daily life and social rights. We review the main conceptualizations of financialisation on various research sites corresponding to the main economic actors, that is: non-financial corporations; the state and individuals; and their complex relationship with financial markets. Our primary objective is to evaluate the contributions and limitations of financialisation studies in these research sites and to identify the main methodological challenges in conceptualising financialisation.

AB Despite the increase in literature on financialisation, most fails to cross theoretical paradigms with empirical data at firm level. Furthermore, very few sectorial studies have been conducted to date. This paper aims to bridge this gap by estimating the importance of sectorial affiliation in explaining the financialisation of large companies in the United Kingdom and Spain. As the definition of financialisation is often imprecise and unclear, we begin with a discussion of the limitations of indicators used in financialisation literature. Secondly, we build a financialisation ratio based on a unique dataset obtained from balance sheets and income statement variables of the companies listed on the FTSE -100 and Continuous Market index of 2000-2015. Finally, and for the first time in literature, we have applied a multilevel methodology in order to study similarities betweenthe estimated sectoral patterns for Spain and the United-Kingdom. Preliminary results reveal a relevant influence of the corporate sector in financialisation ratio variability. The paper opens up a new theoretical and methodological research agenda for analysing financialisation.

ID FINANCIALIZATION
AB Studies of the effects of private equity in the United States have shown that the short-term, return-oriented business model can put a strain on industrial relations between employers and employees. This is similarly assumed to be the case for the coordinated market economy in Germany. Firstly, the article shows for the years 2013 to 2018 the volume of employees affected by private equity takeovers in Germany and the industries in which these employees work. Secondly, it examines whether equal co-determination, which German law requires of companies with more than 2,000 employees, is avoided or ignored by private equity companies to a greater extent than by other types of employers. Thirdly, the change in the activity of works councils whose companies have been taken over by a private equity firm is considered. Overall, it is becoming apparent that private equity companies are more restrictive at the company level than other types of employer and that it is becoming more difficult for works councils to adequately represent employees' interests.

AB This paper explores the financialization of pensions in four European welfare states: the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. In these welfare states, financial markets and financial actors have become increasingly important for pension provisions. Pension financialization is a variegated phenomenon, involving changes in funding mechanism, plan design, financial management and the centrality of funded pension schemes in the political economy. Nationally-specific configurations of these dimensions have created distinct patterns of pension financialization in the four cases. I argue that each pattern is the outcome of specific sticking points for policy reform that have emerged out of the institutional context of the national pension system. Locating these institutional sticking points helps identify common mechanisms of pension financialization across cases that are characterized by empirical variegation.

AB Since the nineties, publications that deal with the relationships between immigration, proficiency in the language of instruction and academic performance of children of im-migrants have multiplied in Spain. The majority defend the linguistic disadvantage hypothesis when explaining the poorer performance of these students. This paper reviews this literature within the Spanish context in order to assess its contributions, limitations and gaps. Despite the advances, it is concluded that the absence of research that si-multaneously measures the proficiency in the language of instruction and the academic performance precludes rigorous empirical knowledge of such relationship and, hence, the contrast of the aforementioned hypothesis. The size of both the samples and the subsamples of the national origin groups, as well as a proper control for certain relevant vari-ables, are pointed out as other research challenges.

AB Based on a selection of recent academic publications, this article analyzes the current situation of Muslim populations within the Spanish state in order to reflect on the ways in which Islam has been developing in the Spanish pub-lic sphere(s) during this last decade. The increase in the number of Spanish Muslim citizens, the higher visibility and diversity of certain expressions of Muslim identities in ur-ban space as well as their participation in social, economic or political activities have contributed to transformations in, and the creation of, multiple public spheres. However, said contributions frequently face various practices such as the invisibilization or foreignization of Muslim populations, especially of women and youngsters, or even the criminali-zation of certain religious practices. These discriminatory mechanisms all play a part in the silencing of potential new social and political actors, which leads to raise questions about the role of public institutions.

AB The aim of the paper is to know whether the social origin influences the probability of being unemployed and, secondly, if so, to find out whether that influence remains even controlling for educational attainment. The third objective is to determine whether the influence of social origin varies depending on the level of education. 49 surveys from the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research carried out between 2013 and 2017 have been handled, and a linear probability model has been applied. The results show that there is a clear effect of social origin on unemployment, and that this effect occurs mainly indirectly, through the educational level. However, social origin continues to have an effect even controlling for education among university graduates (non engineerings) and among those with lower secondary or less education.

Comparative literature departs from three theoretical perspectives on this regard: those that explain misbehavior as a consequence of the experience of incarceration, those that do it based on the characteristics of the imprisoned individuals, and those centered on the relationship between those who are serving a sentence and professionals, and with the penitentiary institution. However, in the Spanish context there is a lack of studies on this subject. This study uses self-reported data of 494 inmates in the final phase of their sentence to analyze the variables related to the probability of receiving a sanction during incarceration in order to propose prevention measures and new hypotheses for future research.

DE Liberty; Moral philosophy; Situational logic; Sociological theory;
   Spanish sociology; Structuralism
AB This article pays tribute to Salvador Giner, sociologist and social philosopher, author of a very broad and varied body of work that has marked Spanish sociol-ogy over the last fifty years. The theme of liberty and its social structure has been selected for the importance it has within his work and for the originality with which he treats it. In this work it is analyzed how Giner focuses and develops both aspects within the frame-work of his intellectual biography and the sociological debates of which the social structure of freedom forms part. This theme also shows the importance that he has always attached to the role of citizens in changing and improving their living conditions in society, one of the ways in which the moral dimension of sociology can be specified.

AB The Atlas de Oportunidades, recently launched by the Felipe Gonzalez and the Cotec foundations, has been defined by its authors as a unique tool to study social mobility in Spain. In this paper I contend that the Atlas is actually a bad tool for studying social mobility for both conceptual and methodological reasons. Conceptually, the Atlas offers a limited tool because it reduces social mobility to income mobility and this obscures our un-derstanding of the factors and mechanisms involved in the processes of socioeconomic attainment and the transmission of social (dis)advantage. The Atlas is also, and most importantly, a bad tool for the study of inter-generational income mobility because its immense database introduces severe methodological biases, which inevitably lead to a gross overestimation of the actual levels of income mobility in Spain.

AB Levels of electoral volatility after the 2008 Great Recession were record in most Western European countries. The main causes of this electoral instability were the nega-tive development of the economy, the crisis of the tradi-tional political parties and the changes in the issues of political competition. At the individual level, it is not clear what factors lead voters to change partisan preferences after the Great Recession. In addition, in general terms, little is known about the differences between a stable voter and a volatile one. This study, for 12 Western European countries after the economic crisis, concludes that the eco-nomic voter model did not always explain the change of party preference after 2008, while sentiments of political dissatisfaction would help us to understand the change of parties between elections.

AB This article analyses the transitions from the university to the labour market in Spain. Using a sample of 23,885 university graduates in 2009, we assess the probabilities of obtain a job in 2014. The results show that, even though a greater educational investment ensures better job opportunities for graduates, the probabilities of ending up over-educated are high, especially for women. In addi-tion, we found that graduates from health care and engi-neering field of studies are more likely to obtain a job and a quality job than those from scientific, social sciences and humanities careers. Finally, it is found that men from masculinized field of studies are more likely to obtain a job and are less likely to be over-educated than women with same characteristics.

The unit of analysis has been the equality plans developed by each of them, as well as the set of measures adopted by these institutions to apply and evaluate them. The analysis of the information has been done with the technique of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). The result of analyzing 83 universities show that factors such as the quickness in creating equality commissions, the creation of equality units or having the first equality plan are related to the quality in the application of the Organic Law of Equality and that public universities assume more than the private the application of the equality plan. which are of obligatory application in accordance with the law. Based on the results obtained, it highlight the need to increase the sensitivity of the government teams towards the equality of women and men.

AB The main obstacle of the neo-abolitionist model is its inability to explain why many women wish to remain in a situ-ation of sexual exploitation or return with those who exploit them after being released. This research, based on a quali-tative methodology, which included in-depth interviews to 155 Central American women victims of sex trafficking, departs from the following research question: why migrant women in prostitution continue in the sex trade even when they could escape from the situation of sexual exploitation they suffer? This paper concludes that migrant women in prostitution are not always passive victims seeking to be rescued and brought into decent jobs. In many cases, af-ter evaluating other alternatives, they consider that the sex trade is more profitable than other activities, since the most important personal asset they have is their erotic capital.

AB This article presents a critical analysis of DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statitstical Manual of Mental Disorders) and proposes comprehending psychological malaise from a gender and a psychosocial approach. Based on sex-prevalence differences based on DSM-V, we analyzed the relationship between normative gender mandates and the emergence of psychological malaises. In front of the biomedical paradigm that constructs disorders from decontextualized symptoms, we investigate the subjective impact of gender, understood as a device of power, and the adaptation to its regulations. We articulate a methodological strategy that starts from the informational/ textual levels and moves to the contextual and interpretative levels of discourse analysis. We emphasize that differences and inequalities in malaises between men and women correspond to the activity/passivity and power/subordination axes that characterize the social construction of masculinity and femininity. In this sense, we link malaises with vulnerabilities and privileges derived from such constructions and propose the concept gender malaise to clarify them.

AB The study of legitimation as a mechanism for explaining the stability of capitalism has been largely displaced by studies on individuals' dispositions towards inequality. Returning to the explanative role of legitimation, we propose an analyti-cal distinction between three mechanisms of legitimation of the social order: social legitimacy, dissimulation, and ideo-logical inversion. These mechanisms share some key fea-tures inspired by classical sociology, while differing in their explanation on how capitalism obtains social validity and endures through time. Specifically, we propose the primacy of the ideological inversion mechanism, as the most plausi-ble thesis for the stability of contemporary societies. From this viewpoint, we suggest a new agenda for theoretical and empirical research on the legitimation of capitalism.

AB This study aimed to compare the gap between gender role values and domestic practice in the UK and Spain. The data were drawn from a sample of British and Spanish male and female respondents to the International Social Survey Programme's (ISSP) 'Family and Changing Gender Roles' module (2002, 2012) and used to create multivariate models using ordinary least-squares regression techniques. The findings suggest that gender role values impacts domestic practice: more time is devoted to housework by egalitarian than non-egalitarian men and less by egalitarian than non-egalitarian women. That effect was not observed for care-giving, however. The impact of gender values on the division by sex of household chores was found to be similar in the UK and Spain. A gradual move to more egalitarian ideals was also observed in both countries over the 10 year period studied.

AB The control exercised by States over their borders to prevent the entry of immigrants represents an important normative challenge for an understanding of global justice. Contrary to the dominant trend that has led to the fortification of borders through walls and fences, this article proposes an alternative way of conceiving borders, a way that allows the fluid movement of people and prevents the reproduction of global inequalities. With the aim of ending or at least cushioning the sufferings generated by such persistent forms of structural injustice, we present here a scenario in which the States pool their authority and resources to reconfigure the world economic system and compensate the victims of the lottery for having been born on the wrong side of a border.

AB The rapid growth in the size of the second generation of immigrants and the large-scale enrolment of descendants of international immigrants diversified the ethnic composition of students in schools in Catalonia. In this changing context, this paper first quantifies the volume and intensity of these changes through the creation of typologies of situations derived from the migratory process and the entry of migrant students into the education system. Secondly, it analyzes the impact of migration on school performance of immigrant students. The results show that first generation students have a large number of school dropouts, which can be justified by composition effect. But the school dropouts observed in the second generation are also comparatively higher than those of the native students, which is a concern for the local administration.

AB It is proposed to know the influence of certain socioeconomic variables depending on whether a young person is the main breadwinner of his or her household, or the child of the main breadwinner. In this way, an approximation is made to the independence of youth. Taking three specific dates as a reference -2006, 2011 and 2015-, the aim is to ascertain the extent to which the economic recession is affecting them. Descriptive analyses and binary logistic regressions have been done, using the Household Budget Survey. There are some differences depending on the year, as well as some general trends. A higher level of education increases the probability that a youth is the child of the main breadwinner of the household, while being male, between 30 and 34 years old or receiving a salary greater than (sic)1,000 is closer to the profile of breadwinner. As for the main breadwinners, a male aged 30 to 34 with an income level greater than (sic)1,000 is the profile closest to a permanent contract.

AB Active labour market policies and social investment paradigm have promoted debates on the evolution of welfare states towards a greater social policy conditionality. This study explores the role of deservingness criteria and their interaction with self-interest and ideology to understand how people develop specific attitudes towards social policy conditionality. Conclusions are drawn through the analysis of existing literature and a public opinion survey from Catalonia that brings a unique opportunity to build an empirical strategy based on the theoretical distinction between deservingness criteria and social policy conditionality. The analysis demonstrates the explanatory power of deservingness criteria and how these interfere with self-interest and ideology. Findings are especially relevant for political communication.

AB There are currently few studies that have analyzed attitudes towards victims of crime, especially in Spain. With the purpose of contributing to this area of research, this work seeks to explore the main causal attributions for victimization and to examine the influence of victimization experiences and gender on the tendency to blame victims. To do this we employed a sample composed of 2,112 university students (63.6% women and 36.4% men). The data was collected through an online survey from November 7 to 20, 2017. The results showed that men blamed victims more than women did. In addition, controlling for the effect of gender, it was found that respondents who had been victimized were less likely to blame victims. The results and their implications are discussed.

AB Based on the high levels of tax fraud encountered in Spain, we understand that citizens are not sufficiently socialised regarding their fiscal responsibilities. In this regard, and in accordance with selective exposure theory, whereby individuals consume media with which they identify ideologically, this paper studies the role played by the press through the way they give relevance to or frame (agendasetting) fiscal matters in a sample of 293 news items. The analysis conducted highlights that only the conservative newspapers examined (El Mundo and ABC) reinforce their characteristic values. In fact, the findings reject the model of polarised pluralism for fiscal matters.

DE Destructive behaviors; Social determinants; University students networks
ID PERSONALITY
AB The objectives of this study are to detect combinations of Machiavellian and bullying actions and to point out their determinants. A sample of five students' networks from Higher Education departments in central Greece (Business Administration, Veterinary and Physical Education & Sport Science) has been collected (245 nodes). Standardized questionnaires were used. Social Network Analysis, Spearman and PCA have been implemented. The Physical Education department exhibits denser bullying and Machiavellianism. Students who try to get beneficial information from their colleagues are susceptible to harm others. Deception is often more likely to happen under conditions of controllability. Making fun is present together with causing unhappiness. Victims of bullying in childhood are susceptible to be bullies as students. Students of high economic status seem to avoid the practice of bullying. Types of Machiavellian and bullying behaviors were proposed based on outdegree ("Offended Machiavellian", "Merciless", "Almost Bullying"), authority ("Angry-Machiavellian", "Bully Machiavellian", "Hiddentroublemaker") and Katz ("Just Offended Machiavellian", "Annoyed", "Amateur/self-seeker").

AB This paper relates the institutionalization of intersectionality and the critics about the lack of its genealogy inspired by the intellectual and activist trajectories of women of color. The text suggests that the loose of radicalness responds to four dynamics of institutionalization of intersectionality. These are: 1) the forget of the genealogy of colour and the ethos of social justice, 2) an epistemological shift to the discipline and standardization, 3) the hegemony of the global North's scientific productions as opposed to those of global South and 4) the politics of innovation and the diversity market within a neoliberal context.

TI SECURITY AND THE LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC STATE. CRIMINALIZING YOUNG PEOPLE'S
   POLITICS
SO REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE SOCIOLOGIA

DT Article
DE Criminalization; Dissent; Liberal Democracy; Politics; Security; State;
   Young people
ID PARTICIPATION; ENGAGEMENT; PROTEST; CRIME
AB The years following the 2008 global recession saw many liberal-democratic states respond to the economic crisis by introducing austerity policies. In turn, this provoked widespread dissent and social movement activism involving large numbers of young people. In response, governments of many different political persuasions moved to suppress these actions by criminalizing political dissent. The article inquiries into state and institutional moves to suppress social movement activism like the 'Maple Spring' student strikes in Quebec, Canada, and the Indignados movement in Spain. While Canada can be described as a 'mature liberal-democracy' and Spain might be better described as an 'emergent liberal-democracy', both criminalized young people exercising their democratic and constitutionally guaranteed rights to free expression and assembly by engaging in various forms of political protests. While some of this can be explained by reference to contradictions inherent in liberal democracies, we consider if it also reflects certain long-standing prejudices directed at young people. Young people have traditionally attracted disproportionate attention from police and legal systems when they are involved in 'conventional' criminal conduct. What role if any did the 'youthful' face of protest play in government moves to criminalize dissent in 2011-12? An account of the 'civilizing offensive' highlights the influence of ageist assumptions that 'young people' require close management. This provides some insight into state responses to young people's engagement in politics when it goes beyond the conventional mode of 'youth participation' prescribed by states committed to managing electoral party politics.

DE Policing of protest; Secessionism; Referendums; Downward scale shift;

ID REPRESSION; SECESSIONISM; ELECTION
AB This article seeks to understand the trajectory of radicalization in the Catalan 'proces'. Regardless of their formal legal standing, referendum campaigns are distinct political opportunities which also generate further opportunities. Contrary to what some theories of protest would predict, when political opportunities are closed down at national level, and repression toughens, violent escalation leading to fragmentation and ultimately demobilization does not necessarily ensue, at least in the short term. As the Catalan 'proces' illustrates between the mid-2000s and late-2018, the combination of mechanisms such as appropriation of opportunities, downward scale shift and movement convergence can mitigate escalation processes. A dense network of local and grassroots assemblies displaced the previously dominant, major civil society organizations that led mass protests, especially during the 2012-2015 'diadas'. These grassroots actors prioritized the organization of dissent through more direct, more disruptive, but mostly peaceful forms of action. This in turn facilitated movement convergence, based upon solidarization, as it opened up local spaces where the activists from across the spectrum could mobilize together, pre-empting a clear violent escalation and the emergence of violent splinter groups till late 2018.

AB The economic crisis transformed the way in which European citizens relate to politics in general but particularly affected young people. The crisis resulted in decreased levels of trust in political institutions and increased levels of political protest. But little attention has been paid to the post-crisis period. Ten years on, what are young people's attitudes and behaviour? This article examines the potential long term consequences of the economic crisis on young people's political interest, political trust and political participation. In examining political behaviour we use a classification of types of participants that allows us to compare young people to adults, and young people before, during and after the economic crisis. Empirically, we use a descriptive approach using survey data from the European Social Survey, covering a considerable period of time (2002-2016) and 16 European countries. The comparison is threefold: young people over time, young people to adults, and young people across countries. The results support the idea of the emergence of a post-crisis youth that is more engaged and participative than adults and young people before the crisis. However the results do not show radical differences among countries that were affected by the economic crisis in varying degrees.

AB In this article we analyse the discourse of conservative commentators and journalists who produced critical items against 15-M mobilisations between 16 May and 30 September 2011 in three newspapers: Abc, Libertad Digital and La Razon. The effort on the part of conservative journalists to deride and frame 15-M mobilisations as a threat should be considered repression; more precisely, these mechanisms should be seen as part of a broader strategy of repression of youth dissent, a strategy where conservative media outlets, through the securitisation of protesting, collaborate with conservative political parties, the police and some segments within the criminal legal system. The examination of the repressive behaviour of the Spanish media reveals a surprising parallelism between the present and a past that was thought to have been long overcome. In their fierce criticism of 15-M activism, Spanish conservative commentators have brought crowd psychology back to life - the popular theory that, until well into the twentieth century, summarized certain nineteenth-century intellectual andcultural elites' fear of middle and working-class activism.

AB This article discusses the use of law and order discourses, agents and institutions in the management of the protest. Social movement studies literature on the police management of the protest and the effects this has on mobilization is reviewed to this end. Notions from the sociology of punishment are incorporated in order to argue for the pertinence of exploring these issues in terms of processes of penalization. A complex vision of punishment is used to question the widespread understanding that there is now less violence involved in protest management: I turn to symbolic violence, and spectators as interpreters of penalization to open new lines of inquiry. To illustrate the types of situation for which these conceptual shifts might productively be applied I refer to examples of mediated political discourse, police action and presence, and the modification and application of legal texts during the last wave of protest in Spain.

ID SPAIN; INDIGNADOS; 15-M/INDIGNADOS; MOBILIZATION; PROTEST
AB This paper focuses on a dialectic of repression and resistance at work in the most recent wave of contentious politics in Catalonia. It emphasises the brief but certain resurgence of a discursive and performative repertoire recollecting Catalonia's revolutionary past in the wave of contentious politics that has swept the region over the past decade, since the onset of the so-called Eurozone crisis. The paper seeks to provide an interpretation of the region's recent cycle of contentious politics through the lens of state repression. It hones in on an emblematic moment, from the spring of 2011, associated with the Indignados movement. It pays particular attention to their violent removal by the police from the Placa Catalunya in May, and to the attempt to surround the Catalan Parliament to disrupt the budget debate the following month. It contends that the violent repression of the Indignados movement in Catalonia by the "regional" authorities is best understood as a reflex response to an incipient challenge to existing constellations of hierarchical and oppressive social relations - a challenge that echoed, indeed threatened to revive, long-suppressed memories of the region's revolutionary past, to "blast" this past "out of the continuum of history," to "appropriate its memory as it flashes up in a moment of danger" (Benjamin). This moment of violent repression by the Catalan authorities proved the precursor, the condition of possibility, for the subsequent re-channelling of contentious politics within the more comfortable confines of hierarchically-structured, nationalist imaginaries.

AB Youth-led protest actions and protests with young people as key protagonists have increased and become more diverse. This article constitutes a detailed case study of evolutions in policing and the legislative framework pertaining to protests and young protesters in Britain, drawing on political sociology, political science, criminology and youth studies. The article first outlines the main protest actions involving young people in twenty-first century Britain. Next, it documents developments in policing tools and methods. It then explains changes to the legislative framework. I argue that through military-style policing tools and methods, combined with authoritarian laws, successive British governments have developed coercive policing, the monitoring of protesters and the criminalisation of dissent. This runs counter to official discourse claiming there has been a return to policing by consent with greater attention to human rights and dialogue following criticisms from various official bodies. Thus, in reality, an ostensibly liberal democratic state is wielding excessive force and coercion, as part of a securitisation process, in a bid to regulate and repress young citizens' protest actions construed as a disruptive threat to the political status quo. In this way, young citizens are being deprived of their democratic and human right to peaceful protest with important implications for Britain and elsewhere.

AB This paper analyses single-mother households' unpaid work distribution -childcare and housework-compared with dual-parent households using the EET 2009-10. We hypothesize that working single-mothers implement two balance strategies: rearrange their time and live with rela-tives that are not part of the nuclear family. Results show that while working single-mothers invest the same amount of time in childcare as dual-parent mothers, the time in-vested in housework is lower, especially in time-demanding activities such as cooking or cleaning. On the other hand, single-mothers more often live with other people compared to dual-parent mothers. Furthermore, other members' time contribution to childcare is significantly higher in single-mother households, but this tendency is not observed for housework.

AB We analyze family practices of parental involvement in children's schooling, through in-depth interviews and ethnographic observation. Instead of taking definitions from expert literature, we approach the concept of parent involvement from their own perspective. Results show that parental practices are conditioned by parents' cultural capital, available time and their children's prior academic achievement. Families strategically concep-tualise the meanings of involvement, so that they fit in the universe of possible practices. We conclude that parental involvement should be understood heeding the availability of resources, instead of the explanations based on familiar wishes.

AB This work examines the effect of family background on the amount of time students devote to the use of new information and communications technology (ICT) and on its type of use. Through an analysis of the frequency and type of use of ICT with data obtained directly from students, our study offers new evidence on the impact of parental education on the time and type of use of ICT for a sample of Spanish students. We show that the educational level of parents reduces the amount of time students devote to the use of Internet and, in turn, increases their propensity to use it for educational purposes. Another empirical finding of our research is that the degree of educational homogamy in the couple exerts an additional effect on the dependent variable.

AB This article explores to what extent the class position, both of origin and destination, explains unequal living conditions, measured by access to certain levels of mate-rial well-being. In this way, three edges of social inequal-ity are explored: conditions, opportunities and results.
   Explanatory models will be developed to understand how certain conditions of origin and individuals inter-vene in the access to three central assets that shape the wellbeing of households: level of labour income, home-ownership and level of material consumption.
   The assumed methodology is of a quantitative nature, using multiple linear regression and binomial logistic re-gression techniques. The source of data comes from the Survey on social mobility and opinions on current society of the year 2012-2013 conducted in the Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires.

   COINTEGRATION
AB Some doubts have been cast on the results of research carried out within the Princeton European Fertility Project, as the changes in fertility over time may not have been measured appropriately. We set out to test the explanatory capacity of some socioeconomic variables which have been used to interpret the historical decline in fertility in traditional demographic transition theory: mortality, education, economic development, urbanisation and employment. We collected information for 49 Spanish provinces over a very long period of time (1860-2001) and we carried out panel cointegrating regressions (FMOLS and DOLS). We show that the decline of mortality, the increase in educational level and the economic factors played a leading role in the historical decline in fertility (first demographic transition). The demographic transition theory was dramatically shattered as a result of the research carried out in the course of the Princeton European Fertility Project, but analyses using new econometric techniques show that socioeconomic variables did indeed have a major role in the historical decline in fertility. When modern statistical methods are used, the role of socioeconomic factors in the historical decline of fertility is restored. In the debate surrounding the causes of fertility transition, the results obtained from our analysis of Spanish data oblige us to position ourselves among those experts who maintain that changes in socioeconomic conditions have encouraged couples to have smaller families (adjustment theories).

AB Despite the prolific normative framework on gender mainstreaming in academic institutions, its implementa-tion has not been effective. This article pays attention to the Political Science curriculum. First, we examine the syllabi of first-year courses of all the Political Science degrees offered in Spain through several quantitative indicators and carry out a qualitative content analysis of the main introductory textbooks. Second, we evaluate the impact of such pervasive gender-blind curriculum on students, by means of the case study of a single university, through focus groups. The existing gap be-tween the normative framework on gender mainstream-ing in universities and the practice of its implementa-tion, specifically as regards the curriculum, allows us to reflect on how this deficit can limit the development of students' critical thinking and make their future professional practice reproduce gender inequalities.

DE Simple and Multiple Factor Analysis; Social Survey Measurement Scales

AB The recoding of scale variables is a common step in the analysis of survey data. It is not immune, however, to certain pitfalls, such as the introduction of biases, or potential data distortion. This paper presents a methodological proposal for the validation of any recoding process, whether it involves metric- or categorical-scale variables. The aim of the proposed methodology is to verify the adequacy of the re-codification by indicating how close in structure the re-coded data are to the original data. The basis of the methodology is a factorial analysis technique, Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA), which is performed on a global data table juxtaposing the original-scale and recoded-scale data. The procedure is tested on real-world data drawn from a public opinion poll on perceptions of leading politicians in the Spanish Parliament.

Drawing on a comparative perspective, this article proposes that it is crucial to analyze the identity cleavages that define union strategies, but also the tensions that these open up. Through a comparison of mineworker federations in Chile and Peru, the article explains how a "class" orientation allows the inclusion of precarious workers, although opening conflicts regard-ing the organization's priorities.

The empirical work is based on a qualitative approach by conducting discussion groups formed by immigrant soldiers in regular service. By the discourse analysis we will observe several dimensions of the "national feeling", as well as the meanings of "nation" and "citizenship" that this group sustains. We will also identify a series of positions which show the complexity of the "national" meaning in a world of massive migrations where, more than strong symbolic identities, others closer to personal life strategies are being built.

This is a concept that is developed in a context of lax political regula-tion (soft governance) and where there is no tradition of specific social and employment policies, as it is an in-ternational institutional space where different traditions of the Member States could converge. Taking these as-pects into account, this article aims to delve deeper into the ideological-political meaning and character of the concept of flexicurity. To this end, firstly, we investigate its production context and the theories and regulatory paradigms on which it is based, secondly, an analysis of the discourse of some of the European Commission's texts focusing on this concept is carried out, highlight-ing the unequal semantic load of flexibility and security within it and the semantic transformation that "security" undergoes. This evidence reveals a new reality in the world of work, in which workers and employers seem to have exchanged roles: workers have a moral duty to empower themselves with adaptive skills (their employ-ment situation will depend on whether or not they have done so) while employers become vulnerable to new economic flows.

DT Article
DE Crisis; Empowerment; Neighbourhoods; Social innovation
AB Based on an analysis of the Catalunya case, this article contributes to the ongoing debate on social innovation, offering a general vision of the development of socially innovative practices and looking into its transforming potential in three key areas: 1) creation of social auton-omy spaces; 2) citizen empowerment (especially within communities/collectives and in high social risk/vulner-ability areas) and 3) development of new institutional ar-chitectures that would promote and reinforce social as well as citizen rights. The article forms part of an exten-sive investigation that has combined social innovation mapping, an online survey and various semi-structured interviews with key informants. The article outlines the potential and limitations of social innovation as a factor of social transformation, and thus points out the need for creation of favourable institutional conditions for its spread and consolidation.

AB Even though family is acknowledged to be a key institution is Spain, with a deep influence in multiple facts of social life, few studies have analyzed its role on the individuals' residential trajectories. Using data from a 2008 local survey conducted in the metropolitan area of Granada, this paper researches the importance of two factors- concentration of the family network, and presence of family roots- in spatial mobility and seden-tarism. Our results underline how family networks are crucial to understand why people stay in our context. It is a strong reason to stay in the house and the neigh-borhood for everyone, but at the same time is modified by the social position of the individuals and the families, having a stronger effect on low income families and dis-advantaged neighbourhoods.

AB The study of public opinion is turning in the last years, the study from the traditional descriptive approach with informative and advising purposes to a new explana-tory and generativist approach. This new perspective has focused on the construction and analysis of models where local, microscopic, interactions generate macroscopic regularities in public opinion. The fertility of this new approach is causing a publication rhythm that can be overwhelming. In this paper, we present an up to date revision of the literature on opinion dynamics models. We present the main models and their extensions, and organize the exposition around ten axes that configure the content of each contribution. The paper also offers some reflections on the main challenges for those social scientists that are interested in the dynamics of public opinion.

AB The idea of meritocracy is related to the distribution of goods and rewards based on individual talent and effort, being a principle that legitimizes the unequal distribution of resources in modern societies. Despite the constant references to meritocracy in inequality and stratification research, there are still few conceptual and empirical attempts to understand to what extent individuals perceive and prefer meritocracy, as well as their consequences. The present research proposes a conceptual and empirical framework for studying meritocratic perceptions and preferences, which is then related with economic inequality variables. Using data from the Chilean survey "Social justice and citizenship participation" (N=1,245), the analyses suggest that meritocratic perceptions and preferences are different constructs and that those perceiving an adequate functioning of meritocracy also perceive less economic inequality.

AB In this work we make a comparison between a face-to-face and landline CATI survey using two equivalent samples. The questionnaire has forced-choice questions with vertical disposition of the answers, and grid questions. In the first part we compare the presence of answer effects (primacy and recency) and the number of answers "not know". The telephone survey has fewer partial nonresponse, and presence of recency effect in questions with vertical disposition with 4 and 5 categories.
   In the battery questions we verify if the telephone surveys have a smaller degree of differentiation in the scales, a greater election of extreme answers, as well as a greater assent. This phenomenon has been detected in the questions of 5 and 10 categories of answer, not detecting effect primacy in questions administered with card.

AB School choice has been identified as a key moment in the process of social reproduction of the upper middle class. In Chile, over the last decades, the educational model has depended for the most part in the last decades on what is understood as parent's school choice of school. This model of public policy has coexisted with the selection that educational institutions perform in the admission process. In this article, we present some novel findings that indicate that overcoming barriers to entry to schools, mainly subsidized and private schools, has had a particularly strong relationship with the availability that families have of economic capital, along with their identification with Catholicism and their religious practices. In addition, social, cultural and educational capitals, together with social class, also show important differences.

AB This article presents the results of research related to analyzing the genesis of the Ganemos Zaragoza / Zaragoza in Common (GZ/ZeC) movement and its passage to constituting a political formation. Through an analysis of a survey data (n=253) and key informant interviews, we show that social movements (understood as a new social network) are born in "convoluted" social situations.
   To achieve this goal, we look at the theoretical view of social movements from a relational perspective. Among the main results we can see how GZ/ZeC was formed, at first, through contacts and partnerships established between preexisting social movements, that eventually ended up gaining relational support from which the movement was built and strengthened. Therefore, this text serves to understand how the process was set up for candidates in the municipal elections of May 2015.

ID WORK
AB This paper applies the 'discretionary time' methodology to the Spanish case. Whereas the notion of free time in time-use studies is generally constructed as the remainder once the time dedicated to paid work, domestic work and personal care, respectively, has been subtracted, the notion of discretionary time considers instead the minimum necessary time that is to be dedicated to the above-mentioned groups of activities. By using standards of necessity in place of actual time allocations, it stands as a more accurate approach to temporal autonomy enjoyed by the individuals and, by extension, to their respective personal welfare. In order to unveil existing time-related segmentations in the Spanish society, special emphasis will be put upon the intersections between gender relations and the socioeconomic class.

AB We analyze the role of schooling on intergenerational class mobility in Argentina, Chile, and Mexico. In order to understand the role of schooling it is important to identify its effects as mediator, equalizer and attenuator. We specify, both conceptually and methodologically, these effects and generate empirical indicators for them, using data from national mobility surveys. Our findings indicate that schooling is a powerful mediator in the three countries. However, there are variations between countries in the role of schooling as equalizer and there is no evidence of a significant role as attenuator of the association between class origins and destinations. This suggests that any simplistic interpretation of the effects of schooling on class mobility in Latin America is confronted by a more complex reality, in which schooling is surely an important intervening variable, but has a limited contribution in neutralizing the effects of class origins on class destinations.

ID DE-POLITICIZATION; DEPOLITICISATION; NEOLIBERALISM; POLICY; GOVERNANCE
AB The aim of this paper is to propose an interpretative key to Italy's populist shift in a context of multipopulism. The authors try to analyze the main populist phenomena that have animated Italian politics as variants of the same schema whose point of commonality lies in a shared civil matrix. The hermeneutic thesis is based on the fact that the pattern of multipopulism in Italy has been determined by a succession of populist variants that have only one factor in common: belonging to civil society and, consequently, a marked antipolitical inclination. This anti-political mass attitude and the subsequent cases of populism are associated to the depoliticization process in Italy. By depoliticization the authors mean a set of changes in the ways political power is exercised in the neoliberal era by legitimizing actors less able to witness the presence of the "political".

In this article we analyze the role and correlates of populist political attitudes in Spain, France, and Italy, three countries that present important differences in the nature of the parties articulating populist discourses. In the first place, we conduct factor analyses in order to explore the public opinion map of policy preferences and political attitudes in these three countries. These analyses reveal the presence of a clearly distinguishable dimension of populist attitudes in all these countries. In the second place, we examine the party system articulation of citizen preferences in the bi-dimensional spaces constituted by populist attitudes, left-right economic preferences, and preferences regarding immigration. Our analysis reveals strong associations between populist attitudes and left-right preferences at the party level, and the orthogonal relationship of populist attitudes and immigration preferences. Finally, our analysis of the socio-structural determinants of populist attitudes reveals the positive association of populist attitudes with lower income levels, less qualified occupations, and lower educational levels.

AB Discussions on the relation between populism and democracy have become growingly frequent in the literature. Some authors consider that there is a virtuous relation between both phenomena, while others define the relation between populism and democracy as ambiguous, and a third stream views populism as a threat for democracy. In this article I review three books that are paradigmatic examples of the mentioned currents, and I support the following position: populism is compatible with democracy, and it reinforces its participatory dimension, but it presents certain tensions with political pluralism. In addition, the analysis performed in the present article suggests that the relation between populism and democracy takes specific forms in each case, and systematic comparative research on populist and non-populist actors is needed to better identify the distinctive features of populism.

ID POLITICAL COMMUNICATION STYLE; 5 STARS; GOVERNMENT
AB In the last decade, the economic crisis and the mistrust in democratic institutions have contributed to a major crisis of political parties across Europe. These are some of the causes that led to the formation of political movements with purely populist characteristics as replacement of the traditional delegitimized intermediary bodies. The crisis of representation is the crisis of the post 1945 idea of representation as a tool to increase the people's participation. We have noted a convergence between some populist appeals to direct democracy and the more radical neo-liberal approaches that pretend to reduce people's participation, even if by appealing to some forms of "surrogate representation". The theoretical background of this paper is based upon the relationships between "surrogate representation" and the institutionalization of the neo-populist movements, quickly transformed in neo-populist parties. In other words, we can highlight the strange coming together of technological storytelling on direct democracy with technocracy myths and the overlap of technopopulism with direct democracy and "direct e-democracy" (that is profoundly different from deliberative and participatory e-democracy). The aim of the paper is to analyse the connections between the emerging forms of populism (such as techno-populism), the rhetoric on the importance of digital communication for the improvement of democracy, and the depoliticisation processes.

AB European party systems have experienced crucial changes over the last few decades. Key among these changes have been the electoral punishment of incumbent parties, the political activation of populist attitudes, and the emergence of new parties. These phenomena have been strongly conditioned by the intensity of the economic crisis experienced by European countries. The analyses we present here constitute a first attempt to comparatively examine the main characteristics of spatial and ideological party competition in Spain, France, and Italy after the Great Recession. Our analysis compares actual ideological positions (as perceived by all voters) to the ideal or optimal ideological party positions predicted by spatial competition models based on proximity and directional voting, always on the assumption that parties will choose these positions that allow them to maximize their vote shares. Our analysis aims at assessing the degree to which public attitudes connected to the Great Recession, in particular, government evaluations and populist attitudes, have affected ideological locations. Our results show that there are appreciable differences between the estimates inferred from models using crisis-related variables and those derived from models that did not include such variables. The analysis also shows that the estimates based on models using governmental performance evaluations and populist attitudes are slightly closer to the real positions of political parties. Finally, we also observe that differences in ideal estimates are larger in Spain and Italy, that is, in the two countries that suffered the most during the Great Recession.

AB Can a study of populist parties in Southern Europe shed light on the relation between populism and Euroscepticism? The proposed comparative framework examines the different degrees and types of Euroscepticism of populist parties in the Southern region. We expect that the variety of populist parties in this region, more oriented to the left, will help to expand our knowledge of the links between populism and Euroscepticism. Overall, our article shows that left and right-wing populist parties share what may initially look as a homogeneous Eurosceptic profile. However, further examination supports that left-wing populist parties hold more positive views of the EU in indicators related to the political side of the EU (powers of the European Parliament and enlargement).

DE Democracy; Discourse; Ideology; Neoliberalism; Rhetoric
AB This research note emphasizes the importance of populist phenomenon for social analysis and why is necessary to go beyond its consideration as an intruder of democracy. Further, three recent books on populist phenomenon are revised highlighting their differences related to its foundations, social nature and political consequences, as well as its limitations by not considering with necessary depth its sociological and historical roots. It is concluded that the populist phenomenon is intrinsic to democracy, a consequence of complex changes related to historical periods of transition to new ways of production, consumption and life styles to whom the democratic systems do not give effective answer because of institutional inertias or blockages.

AB This study examines, from a regional perspective, the relationship between the patterns of time allocation to paid and domestic work within heterosexual couples and the socio-economic and institutional characteristics of regions. The hypothesis of this work is that, in regions with an institutional system characterized by generous social and family policies, greater participation of women in the labor market, greater wealth and higher educational level, the distribution of paid and domestic work between men and women is more egalitarian. Regarding domestic work, we distinguish between time devoted to housework and childcare. Using the 2009-2010 Spanish Time Use Survey, we applied Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis. We identified five groups of regions or patterns of time allocation between men and women. Heterogeneity among these patterns can be associated to regional differences in the economic, social and institutional settings.

DT Article
DE Aging; Discourse analysis; Ethnography; Inequality; Social policy
ID HOME-CARE; SPAIN; POLICIES; OLDER
AB This research aims to analyze the different family strategies in elderly people with severe dependencies. To do so we focus in the different tensions, determinants and justifications that are managed in each of the care's possible options, and how these vary across social classes. Ethnography methodology is used, conducting depth interviews and systematic observations in four family's households, each of them belonging to a particular social class. This work argues that the meaning associated to "good care" varies in relation with the situation and the social class. While upper-class families justify the goodness of the care's commodification, in lower-class families the discourses about what care's strategy implement is indeterminate and oscillating. Exceptional situations like the illness of the main care-giver would justify the use of other strategies such as the elderly residency.

AB The objective of this article is to contribute to the debate regarding the destructuring of eating practice in contemporary societies. The data used is taken from a nationwide survey on Spanish eating habits (ENHALI, 2012). The study examines the hypothesis of the destructuring of eating habits by analysing three concrete areas. The first of these is the destructuring of timetables. Secondly, the article examines whether there exists a process of defamilisation of eating habits. The third section discusses whether eating practice can be said to be anomic. After this study it can be affirmed that the synchrony of time, the importance given to sociability and adherence to the food standard present a more homogeneous than unstructured image of the eating habits of Spanish society.

AB This article focuses on the personal identity expressed through open answers via the TST (Twenty Statements Test) and corroborates the high influence of the situation and the interviewer in self-definitions. Summing up to 2,591 subjects, two different samples have been extracted, to which this instrument has been applied in homes, through an interviewer and through computer application. The analysis compares the responses in number of sentences and in three indicators: subjectivity of the sentences, group anchorage with which the individual is identified in its definition, and attribution or traits with which the subjects are defined using three indicators: subjectivity, anchorage and individualization. It is concluded that the situation and the interviewer have a high influence on the subjectivity of the answers, while the age of those who define themselves, has a positive influence on the anchorage and negative on the attribution in consonance with the theses of individuation.

This study aims at shedding light on how work schedules allows Spanish fathers to be available to take care of their children when they are not at school or childcare centres. By using time-use data, this study seeks to contribute to previous research by providing a nuanced description of how much and when work takes place throughout the day , as well as how this is associated to occupational and parental statuses, gender and the incidence of the economic recession. 'Available time' for the family is analysed, understood as time away from work excluding the core business hours (i.e. 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Results show that being a mother has still a direct reflection on time availability, while fatherhood does not. Also, time availability presents a complex relationship with the class structure, which does not seem to have been altered by recession. Finally, there seems to be a gender convergence in time availability, only due to its reduction in the case of women.

SO REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE SOCIOLOGIA

DE Derived Preferences; Discount Rate; Electoral Coordination;
   Expectations; Incentives
AB Empirical research on preferences about the formation of electoral coalitions is focused on ideologically proximate parties. In this paper I argue that electoral coordination also takes place between ideologically non-proximate parties, but with similar derived preferences. To test this argument I examine the case of an electoral coalition between antagonistic parties, Solidaritat Catalana -formed by carlistas, regionalistas and republicanos- in the 1907 national election. I employ a model of electoral coordination. The empirical analysis relies on information about Solidaritat Catalana, the electoral law, and the results of the 1901, 1903, 1905 and 1907 national elections and the March 1907 province election.

TI SEXUAL ABSTENTION DURING LENT IN ANDALUSIA ALONG THE 20TH CENTURY AND
   ITS IMPACT ON THE SEASONALITY OF BIRTHS
SO REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE SOCIOLOGIA
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Conception; Diffusion; Erosion; Fertility; Religious precepts
ID SPAIN
AB A religious precept that forbids sexual intercourse during Lent has remained in effect for centuries in Catholic populations. This interdiction produces a decrease of conceptions and a rebound after that period, which are difficult to detect because in populations that did not exercise effective control of the fecundity a peak of conceptions is observed during the spring. At present, this precept has disappeared as a result of a process of erosion that we do not know enough. With the anonymized data of all the people surviving at the beginning of 2003 and born in Andalusia (n=8.397.206), this paper aims to determine the importance of this interdiction and its vanishing process throughout the twentieth century. This process takes part with the decrease of fertility and the erosion of seasonality of births. Finally, it is also analyzed to what extent this transition to modernity is the result of a process of diffusion that has gone from municipalities with a big population size to small municipalities.

ID DETERMINANTS; WOMEN; WORK; PATTERNS; DISTANCE; TRAVEL; AREAS
AB Sex differences in commuting have been a recurring object since finding that women work closer to home. However, the way in which they operate is the subject of debate between two perspectives: the female entrapment theory and the traditional theory. The first one tells us that sex differences in commuting are due to gender, in particular to the greater domestic workload and the relegation of the female labor role as secondary. While the second emphasizes how these differences are due to intermediate factors, mainly socio-economics. The objective of the present study is to contrast both hypotheses for the Andalusian case, through the 2011 Social Survey of mobility in Andalusian urban regions. The results obtained point to the complementarity of both, finding that gender inequalities operate more indirectly, through occupational segregation, than directly.

AB The topic of varieties of capitalism comparatively studies the different ways in which each country organizes its economy. Literature has initially distinguished two antagonistic models: liberal market economies (LMEs), and coordinated market economies (CMEs). Subsequently, new categories have been added, such as State-influenced market economies (SMEs). In this article it is argued that the corporate network is one more dimension that can be considered to classify an economy in a determined variety of capitalism. The analysis of the Spanish network from 1917 to the present day shows the importance of the public companies in their configuration. This finding, and the comparison of the Spanish network with the networks of other countries, confirms the inclusion of Spain among SMEs.

AB The research studies control corporate structures and distribution in those networks formed by the shareholders and the managerial boards of directors (CA) of the 227 largest Spanish companies in terms of operating income (IE) in 2013. The results allows to identify three control patterns. First, a dense network of shareholders and managers that develop a centralized core and exercise direct control. Secondly, a set of Global Collective Investment Institutions (IICs), mostly non-residents, exercising a style of indirect control through the participation in the capital of Spanish companies or through subsidiaries of transnational corporations, which play through the elaboration and negotiation strategies from outside the managerial boards of the investees. Third, a more personal and direct control pattern exercised by blockholders and managers in isolated companies.

AB Cultural hierarchies vary in time and context. While traditionally cultural hierarchies have been thought to reflect and correspond to social divisions (Bourdieu's famous idea of homological tastes), for some decades scholarship has pointed towards an opening and widening of traditional highbrow legitimate taste. While these developments are usually studied in relation to direct cultural consumption and taste, little attention has been paid to institutions that contribute in shaping "legitimate taste". In this article, our goal is to fill that gap by looking at the music coverage of European elite newspapers between 1960 and 2010. We aim to answer the question of whether elite newspapers have experienced a process of cultural opening in the field of music in the aforementioned period.

To that aim, we use the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions Survey. The econometric technique is a trivariate probit model, which allows estimating the three dependent variables simultaneously. The results show, among other things, that age, country of birth, health status and year of the interview have a different impact on Spanish women compared to Portuguese women.

AB This study explores the opinions of Spanish men about prostitution, especially of those men who have paid for sexual services. It is based on a random study of 1048 men resident in Spain and aged from 18 to 70, carried out via a telephone survey, using a questionnaire made up of 37 questions. Of the men interviewed, 20.3% have paid for sexual services at some time in their lives, and 15% within the last year. From the results a typology of prostitution clients can be extracted depending on their motivation for buying sexual services: Funners (24.1%) who are seeking leisure and entertainment; Thingers (21.7%) who want sex with no involvement or commitment; another 21.7%, the Couple Seekers, who are trying to find a partner; the Riskers, (19.8%) who, as well as sex, are attracted by the associated risk behaviours; and the Personalizers (12.6%) who are those who want sex with intimacy and companionship. These groups differ in their sexual satisfaction and in their opinions or beliefs about the reasons women have for providing sexual services. In function of these different groups, recommendations are made for increasing prostitution clients' sensitivity and awareness about human trafficking.

DE Retirement; Unemployment; Work Inactivity; Working Life

AB The State's response to the current economic crisis has not been the same as that of the 1980s and 1990s. While then an extraordinary extension of the unemployment benefit and pre-retirement were commonly used, the current strategy (by the State) is to extend the working life by restricting the access to these two ways of exiting the labour force. We draw on the quarterly data from the Labour Force Survey between 1976 and 2016, and the Continuous Sample of Working Lives between 2004 and 2015. Results from multinomial logistic regression show that key variables that explain differences in labour force participation have to do with the socioeconomic group and the gender role associated with men: the higher the level of education and the more complex the household structure, the longer the working life. Moreover, we confirm that the protective role of the state has retracted since 2014.

ID LEGITIMACY
AB Existing studies about inmate's perception of prison conditions in Spain tend to refer to 'the' prison, as if all prisons were uniform institutions with similar life conditions. However, international research suggests that the experience of imprisonment is different depending on the prison in which the sentence is served.
   To analyze this question, we have administered an adaptation to the Spanish context of the survey Measuring Quality of Prison Life in four prisons of Barcelona. Our findings suggest that quality of prison life is significantly different among prisons, that these differences have consequences for inmates' wellbeing, and that most of those differences are due to organization and personal relations and not mainly to inmates' individual characteristics.

DE Charismatic Leadership; Democracy; Leadership
AB This paper deals with Weber's ideas in relation to the so-called 'plebiscitary democracy'. Firstly, it describes his ideas on parliamentary democracy and plebiscitary democracy, documenting their particularities and differences. Secondly, it specifically addresses the plebiscitary democracy as a kind of charismatic domination. The study analyses both Weber scientific analysis on plebiscitary democracy as the political proposal for a specific time in the history of Germany, early into the post-war period. This paper highlights the theoretical limits of the proposed plebiscitary democracy from Weber's own theory. The study also revalues and revisits Weber's analysis of a kind democracy that seems to be increasingly present in current political times.

SO REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE SOCIOLOGIA

DT Article
DE Dynamic Perspective; Inequality; Labour Market
AB The relationship between the risk of poverty and the participation in the labour market has gained major attention in last years. The majority of the research carried out in this field is from a cross-sectional perspective. The dynamic analysis of poverty is particularly interesting for answering several questions: is employment enough to avoid poverty? Is in-work poverty a temporal or a permanent state? In this article in-work poverty dynamics in Spain are analyzed with the objective of determining whether entries into in-work poverty are temporal, whether people fall several times in that situation or, on the contrary, whether in-work poverty can become in a permanent situation which is very difficult to leave. At the same time, the different duration profiles of in-work poverty are analyzed.

AB Reciprocity, a social principle that emerges in non-negotiated, inter-personal exchange, is arguably a key construct in generating social capital. However, little research has made this empirical connection. Building on an Orientation-Stimulus-Reasoning-Orientation-Response model, this study advances a theoretical and empirical model in which news use and political discussion tie strength contributes to the development of reciprocity and social capital. Drawing on two-wave panel data, results suggest that reciprocity is a strong predictor of social capital. News media use also directly predicts reciprocity, as well as political discussion with both strong and weak ties, and social capital. Additionally, discussion with weak ties and reciprocity mediate the relationship between news use and social capital.

This article, based on a qualitative methodology that includes in-depth interviews with owners of 73 centers dedicated to the sexual commerce in nine Mexican States, examines the prostitution of mi-nors in these places towards the appreciations of the pimps, and concludes that the spread of a culture of bribery in the prostitution industry leads to the solidifica-tion of networks of complicity between the police and pimps leading to the prostitution of minors.

AB Our purpose is to look into one of the social problems affecting the most to older people, namely the feeling of loneliness. We intend to approach this problem differ-entiating its social and emotional dimensions. Through a qualitative methodological strategy. focus groups as procedure to raise data and Grounded Theory as ana-lytical perspective. we study how that feeling is expe-rienced among a profile of older persons particularly affected by loneliness: older widowed persons living alone. Our findings prove that these persons suffer from emotional loneliness, especially those who enter wid-owhood at a later age and after decades of marriage. This feeling is linked to the loss of their spouse and it is at night when it is more likely to emerge. Moreover, wid-owhood comes along with the risk of social loneliness because of the relational distancing from friends who used to be connected to the married couple. We have identified as well gender differences regarding the im-pact of loneliness, being men those who are especially frail to confront it.

SO REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE SOCIOLOGIA

DT Article
DE Agency; Beliefs; Morphogenesis; Mosphostasis; Structure
AB Habits and reflection are considered fundamental driving forces of human agency. How they affect our behavior depends on the complex relationships between structure and agent. This article analyzes the role of habits and reflection from the individual, based on Searle approaches on Intentional mental states. The first part analyzes Archer's model apropos the debate agency/structure, and, the following section concerns the agency, taking into account the Intentional mental states. If habits and reflection, as Archer argues, depend on the morphostasis and societal morphogenesis, such processes must be manifested in consciousness somehow. This research argues that analysis of consciousness and Intentional states allow understanding the influence of the social order over the individual, specifically from beliefs and its satisfaction condition.

AB This article studies the labour integration of onward im-migrants, those who have lived in a country other than their birth country before arriving to Spain and there-fore have a previous migration experience. Specifically, it analyzes whether this group experiences more suc-cess in its labor market integration in terms of occupa-tional attainment than immigrants who reside in a differ-ent country for the first time. To do this, data from the National Immigrant Survey 2007 are used. The results show that onward immigrants have a better occupation-al achievement when compared to other workers born abroad. The role played by the migration experience is greater for immigrants born in underdeveloped coun-tries, especially if they are women and have resided in a developed country. In addition, the migration experi-ence can mean greater performance to qualified occu-pational career paths.

Through a qualitative methodology com-bining interviews and participant observation, the arti-cle compares household care services and domestic work in both cities. The analysis shows how the moral, emotional and material dimensions are articulated in the performance of the work. This analysis contributes to the "denaturalization" of care work by showing that those jobs can be defined in multiple ways, implying very different limits in the definition of the tasks, qualifications, working times and labour relations.

AB A controlled experiment establishes that differences in relational proximity can evoke or suppress a willingness to give to an unrelated cause. Four treatment groups underwent the same set of exercises but two in a closer relational environment and two in a more distant relational environment. Half of the subjects in each relational environment further received an unannounced doubling of pay. On exit, all participants had the option to give to charity. The experiment showed that the charitable giving was driven by relational factors, not by pay. We can learn that prosocial (pro-giving) inclinations interact with the wider social environment, and that these complex relational parameters may be evaluated by easy-to-measure giving patterns.

AB This article offers a panoramic view of the field of the social studies of energy while introducing the articles of the special issue. It begins by discussing the progressive interest on studying the social aspects of energy. We relate this interest to the increasing challenges imposed by global climate change as well as the growing sociological attention to the material dimension of social life. The article suggests understanding energy and energy related phenomena as a socio-technical object which involve material, social, cultural and technical elements. The article then briefly describes different research areas concerning the intersection between energy and society and present the contributions to the monograph. We suggest that the articles comprised in this special issue are not only relevant for social scientist interested on energy related issues; they might also help energy professionals and researchers from outside the social sciences to further problematize the social aspects and challenges of energy.

AB During recent years, there has been a growing sociological interest for studying transitions to pro-environmental energy systems. Against this backdrop, this article presents the main empirical findings of a case study that qualitatively addresses a policy of replacing stoves in the City of Temuco, Chile. The article uses two complementary theoretical approaches, the Multilevel perspective (MLP) and the Theory of Social Practices (TPS) to describe the existence of lock-in mechanisms for sustainable transition processes, both at institutional level and at the level of social practices through which heating is organized. The articles relies on 23 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders of an stove replacement process and 23 participant observation exercises aimed at describing the heating practices of Temuco households. Based on this evidence, the paper reinforce the need to address different theoretical lenses in order to better account for the different scales and actors that constitute energy transitions. Such an approach can facilitate greater sensitivity to the difficulties that constitute pro environmental energy transition processes.

AB There is increasing realisation amongst policy makers and industry that 'social acceptance' is a key issue in the deployment of low carbon energy technologies and infrastructures in Europe. The development of hydrogen fuel cell technologies (HFCs) involves small-scale residential and transport applications, as well as large-scale infrastructures, the socio-technical embedment of which will be influenced by the public and stakeholders in various roles. Previous research on public acceptance has investigated public perceptions of HFCs in specific countries. Here we present survey data on a multi-country scale, using a multivariate, socio-psychological approach. We particularly focus on cross-country differences in self-reported awareness and familiarity, global attitude and support in relation to mobile and residential HFC applications. Our data shows that less than half of the population in the seven countries are aware of the existence of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies in the context of energy production. The level of familiarity with both applications is low, and less than 10% of respondents consider themselves familiar with these applications. In general, respondents in the seven countries have a positive initial attitude towards HFC technologies and are likely to accept and support the adoption of residential fuel cells and HFCEVs. The seven populations studied are similar in their attitudes towards HFC technologies, but there are small to moderate differences in awareness and acceptance of HFC applications across countries. We finally found that positive and negative affect, perceived benefits, preference for alternative technologies, trust, and age were significant correlates of acceptance of HFC applications. We consider the implications of these differences for the public acceptance of HFCs.

TI HUILLICHE ENERGY Experiments in integration and ontological

SO REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE SOCIOLOGIA

DT Article
DE Indigenous People; Ontological politics; Participation; Wind Power
AB The island of Chiloe, in southern Chile, was the miseen-scene of an unprecedented project: the development of a wind farm in which the Hulliche community, the ancestral people of the area, would own and run the operation. With the support of the Inter-American Development Bank, the aim of the project was the production of sustainable and renewable energies, but more importantly the integration of indigenous communities into the Chilean society via their participation in a high-value economic enterprise. Drawing on the idea of citizen participation as a form of experimentation, in this article we follow ethnographically the process of incubation, development and failure of this project. The case, we argue, allows a reflection about the risk of cultural aggression embedded in participatory experiments, but also about their capacities to crack open productive spaces for identity, political and ethical speculation. We coin the term "ontological disagreements" to indicate the ambivalences of participatory experiments and to debate about the future of indigenous engagement in energy projects.

AB An increasing number of community energy projects have emerged recently, reflecting diverse sociotechnical configurations in the energy sector. This article is based on an empirical study examining different types of community energy projects such as energy cooperatives, public service utilities and other entrepreneurially oriented initiatives across the European Union. Based on an in-depth analysis of three case studies, the article aims to introduce a social entrepreneurship perspective when discussing the relationship between local embeddedness and different forms of organisation and ownership in community energy. The results indicate that community energy projects can expand beyond the local scale without losing their collective and democratic form of functioning and ownership. Moreover, social movements can act as catalysts for this expansion beyond the local, in a quest for wider social transformation. Social entrepreneurship may provide a suitable analytical lens to avoid the 'local trap' when examining different forms of organisation and ownership in renewable energy, and further explore the question of scaling.

AB Nuclear energy is a complex technology that requires intensive use of resources and high centralized decision-making processes, whose governance poses a real challenge for democratic societies. In this article we explore the social perceptions about nuclear energy in Spain through the analysis of opinion surveys and secondary data about the main actors of three case studies (Vandellos I, Valdecaballeros, and Radioactive Waste Storage). The results show how the arguments of the several actors are based on very different dimensions of risk, often ignored in the surveys and by the actors, which represents a serious difficulty to overcome the controversies caused by this type of energy.

AB Non-renewable fossil fuels made possible what has been called the modern world. Given that non-renewable resources are increasingly becoming more and more difficult and costly to extract, the transition to renewable energy sources is a crucial task. In order to frame possible avenues towards responsible innovation and transition in democratic societies, this paper will built on the concept of "earthly experiments" to highlight some of the conditions and processes that may foster responsible innovation and learning processes. This is done by building on empirical examples from the establishment of geothermal energy systems. The paper will then unfold the sociological notion of earthly experiments in order to critically highlight on what this could mean to democratically constitute citizens as part of "science" thus conceived. The paper will show how such experimental processes deal with questions of acceptability and democratic governance, and how the political limits of experimentality are rendered visible and manageable. We show to what extent "experiments in the wild" are able to cope with increasing uncertainty and the unavoidable ignorance that complicate conditions for the transition towards renewable energy, but that may also open up new paths towards the engagement of citizens in processes of technoscientific exploration.

A qualitative and phenomenological approach was used conducting a series of semistructured interviews to professionals of different categories of obstetric areas of three public hospitals in the region of Murcia. The stories talk about of professionals trained for the life they have to face death, talk about of a lack of institutional training to the professionals react drawing on the experience, empathy or self-taught. They talk about painful situations that are experienced by clinicians with hints of tragedy, speak of care directed to the psychological management of mourning, talks about the transition from coping models duels based on avoidance and emotional detachment to others centered on the verbalization of experience and contact with the stillborn.

DT Article
DE Class paths; Intergenerational change; Risk; Social mobility;
   Uncertainty
AB The article examinates, from a qualitative perspective, the constructions of meaning (perceptions) that people elaborate in relation to the social position they occupy. It does so by approaching the way in which these subjects construct present interpretations, including a past and a future reference and, from these elaborations, they put into practice strategies to organize the trajectories of social mobility of the members of the household. The technique used was that of life history, analyzed in a comparative way. In general it was found that social origin has an effect on the way in which such perceptions are constructed. The social classes best positioned in the social structure present relatively accurate perceptions about the future, referenced to the (own) capacities to establish strategies to achieve it. In contrast, those who experience processes of short-range intergenerational mobility and/or spurious mobility see an idealization of the past, and a disagreement with the present that translates into uncertainty with the future. As for the working classes refer to an improvement in their living conditions, based on the triad employment - social security - consumption and a context (political economic) that maintains these elements.

AB Ideology is a controversial concept which generates very different attitudes. This paper proposes the construct "ideological aversion" to describe one of those reactions. The ideological aversion is a combination of two components: rejection of ideologies, and defense of purely technical policy actions. Previously, ideology is defined as a way of seeing, prefer, and act in the world, which arises from the relationship between two dimensions: social frames and needs. The ideological aversion also responds to a way of being in the world, which keeps social performances and satisfy psychological needs. This document also provides an instrument to measure the concept. The questionnaire consists of ten items, five for each of the two components of the ideological aversion. It has been constructed from an on line sample of n = 650, and has been tested in a face-to-face sample of n = 340, showing good psychometric characteristics.

AB The purpose of this paper is to present an analytical view of Pierre Bourdieu's habitus concept. For this definition the author is reviewed, then a look of both explanatory and hermeneutic possibilities of this concept, and finally the criticism he has received, to try to answer them from the more analytical approach proposed are reviewed. On one hand, it shows that you can take some of the criticisms made by authors such as analytical Boudon and Elster. On the other hand, the greater relevance of other authors noted, the lack of sensitivity to social contexts. The habitus allows an objectivist study of established social practices of meaning, through a combination of mechanisms and structuralist concepts to capture this meaning.

   LAW
AB This paper analyzes the influence of immigration policy and the Great Recession on spousal reunification in Spain. After a significant immigration boom (2000-2008), family-related migration has contributed to the significant flows that continued to arrive in Spain during the economic crisis. But this type of migration was subject to both the crisis and immigration policy changes, such as visa conditions, which may not have been specifically addressed to influence these flows. Using data from the Spanish Labor Force Survey (LFS), the research considers married primary immigrants who came to Spain from the four main countries of origin (Ecuador, Colombia, Romania and Morocco) and concludes, first, that tighter conditions to visit the country-particularly tourist border controls-discourage spousal reunification. The reason could be that during the immigration boom, illicit immigration abounded and secondary immigrants were arriving as tourists. Secondly, reunification was slowed down by the Great Recession for the majority of the countries considered, except Ecuador. Unsurprisingly, given the job losses in typical male jobs, the negative influence of the crisis is greater for female primary immigrants. Third, contrary to the expectations that placed secondary immigrants as people with relatively low ties to the labor market, the research shows that because spousal reunification coincided with a deep economic and job crisis, female secondary immigrants increased the family labor supply in order to maintain consumption and/or remittance in what looks like an added-worker effect.

AB In contemporary societies, social representations of technoscience have become more complex and polyhedral, moving away from traditional positive conceptions. We explore the growing importance of ambivalence in their analysis, as well as questioning the cognitive deficit model as an explanatory theory. We note that cognitive shortcuts linked to the level of religiosity and post-materialist values have a decisive role in shaping the positions on controversial aspects of science and technology. Furthermore, we conclude that these links vary in different national cultures. In Spain, the problematization of the impacts of technoscience is associated with both lower levels of religiosity and the increase of post-materialist concerns due to the secularization of the society.

DE Relationships; University
ID ROMANTIC LOVE; PERCEPTIONS; SCALE
AB This paper aims at describing love attitudes styles amongst the youth at Universidad de Sevilla and reviews differences in such attitudes by sex-gender system. To do so, a descriptive and interdisciplinary study was conducted using a contextualized adaptation of the Love Attitudes Style Scale (Hendrick et al. 1998). This validated data collection tool, referred to as 'ReLAS,' was applied to 447 students from the said Spanish university (267 women and 180 men). Our findings indicate that, overall, the subjects possess an idealized, romanticized view of love, whereby factors such as sexuality, passion and attraction play a secondary if significantly nuanced role, as emerged when looking into sex-based differences that are attributable to gender roles.

TI COSMOPOLITANISM AND THE POLITICS OF TRANSLATION

DT Article
DE Cosmopolitanism; Ethnocentrism; Linguistic Hospitality; Translation
ID MODERNITIES; VARIETIES
AB Translation has gained a central importance in recent accounts of cosmopolitanism which emphasise global interdependence and the interaction between different cultures and traditions. In this context, it becomes necessary to formulate a politics of translation that ques-tions some idealist assumptions about translation that are present in the sociological literature, specifies trans-lation as a fundamentally ethnocentric act, and formu-lates relevant strategies to confront this inherent ethno-centrism in order to open up translation to the difference of the other. Such politics consists in an extension of an ethics of translation based on linguistic hospitality, so that cultural asymmetries, inequalities and conflicts at a wider social level are addressed and political and normative responses to them can be devised from a cosmopolitan perspective. In this light, the relevance of a politics of translation as an alternative to a politics of identity is approached.

DE Criminal Reiteration; Delinquency; Juvenile Court
ID YOUNG OFFENDERS; YOUTH LEVEL; VALIDITY
AB Risk assessment in juvenile recidivism allows understanding the specific factors that drives the juvenile to the commission of offences. Most of these juveniles will have a punctual relation with the justice system and only a small percentage will persist in this type of conducts. However, it seems that society perceives these juveniles as high risk offenders with high rates of recidivism. Hence, with the aim to clarify this topic, the objective of this paper is to explore the general risk of recidivism and the areas with higher risk, examining the risk of recidivism in a follow up period. Participants in this research were juveniles with a criminal record in the Juvenile Court of Castellon (N = 210). The Youth Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (YLS/CMI) was administered to the juveniles along the follow up period of two years. Results show a majoritary profile of low risk juveniles, and a punctual relation with justice, rejecting the belief of dangerousness on juvenile offenders. On the contrary, juvenile recidivists with long criminal trajectories are in fact characterized by a high risk that would increase throughout the follow up period.

The logic behind the construction of the instru-ment and its structure is described, focusing on expos-ing the properties of construct validity through EFA and convergent validity through an inverse correlation with a scale of perceived insecurity. In terms of reliability, we present Cronbach's Alpha for the General Scale and for each subscale generated. It concludes with the scope, limitations and projections of the scale, as well as suggestions for its expansion and potential for application in other contexts.

SO REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE SOCIOLOGIA
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Health; Psychiatry; Rights; Transgender; Transsexuality
ID IDENTITY DISORDER
AB This paper analyses how transsexuality has been con-ceptualized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). We will see how the successive changes in the denomination and diagnostic criteria are largely due to the pressure that the editors of the manual have received by scientists, academics, political organ-isations and organisations for the transgender rights. As a result of these tensions the transsexuality has been reconceptualised in several occasions, although the con-notations inherent to the diagnostic category which treat it as a disease have endured. Likewise, we will address the current debate on pathologisation of transsexual-ity which is dominated by two opposed discourses: one which justifies the inclusion of transsexuality in the DSM because it considers that the diagnostic guarantees the access to hormonal and surgical therapy, and the other which criticises its inclusion because it considers that it contributes to the stigmatisation of the transgender peo-ple. The paper concludes that the trans-specific health resources should be regarded as a fundamental right which cannot be subject to clinical requirements.

AB In this paper we analyze the contexts of vulnerability involved in the formation of the phenomenon of chronic pain without organic cause, or fibromyalgia (DC / FM). A key factor that articulates the contexts of vulnerability and subjectivities that they produce are gender rela-tions, we characterize two (traditional and transitional) models. The research from which we derive the data is qualitative by semi-structured interviews, in the context of metropolitan Barcelona (Spain). From the analysis we have made a close relationship between the devel-opment of the DC / FM and social models of gender, both in the context of constitution of subjectivity of the interviewees, child life, and in the context of occurrence follows and development of the DC / FM in adulthood.

AB When voters cast their ballot in local elections, are they only taking into account national factors? Or do they, to the contrary, also pay attention to local elements? In this article we argue that voters' evaluations of candidates for mayor are particularly important to explain party choice in this type of subnational elections in Spain. To empirically verify the existence of this relationship, we focus on the 1999, 2007, and 2011 elections. By dwell-ing on a relatively heterogeneous sample of municipali-ties and working with surveys undertaken by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociologicas, we show the effect of candidates' evaluations at the expense of a less pronounced role of ideology. The provided evidence also suggests that this pattern becomes stronger in small municipalities and more recent elections.

AB International studies have indicated sociology of old age's insufficient development and consolidation as distinct scientific and academic field. In Spain, this speciality is still pretty much invisible, in disarray, and not fully established. Aiming to collaborate in the appraisal of the current and future state of sociology of old age in Spain, a Delphi study with participation of 12 experts has been undertaken. Results highlight two main threats for Spanish sociology of old age, namely perception of old age as a life stage in extinction, and professional encroachment. Invisibility of sociological studies of old age and lack of interest from higher education administrators, policymakers, and older adults themselves are considered threats as well. The main asset in this field is deemed to be the community of sociologists involved in old age studies.

AB Mismatches between the number of hours people actually work and the hours they would prefer to work are common, and they have important consequences for individual, family and organizational life. This study contributes to prior research examining how the quality of work is affected by the economic crisis. Using data from the Spanish Labor Force Survey from 2005 to 2014, it tests three possible competing predictions for trends in working hour mismatches during the economic downturn. The study reveals that the level of mismatches has increased significantly with the economic recession due to the growing number of people who would wish to work more hours than they actually do. Findings show that the increase in hour mismatches has been particularly striking among workers employed under fixed term contracts, part-time contracts, those in low-status occupations and women. The economic crisis has widened the gap between hig-hand low-status workers over the last decade.

AB The aim of this study was to establish a typology of job market entry strategies among Olympic athletes. Guided by rational choice theory and social reproduction theory, we conducted a telephone survey among 94 athletes (68 men and 26 women). Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to identify four distinct groups, which we called parallel life strategists, freelance strategists, lifetime athletes, and non-strategists: it's a job. The results show that athletes from families with greater economic and cultural capital implement career transition strategies further in advance and achieve greater career success and satisfaction. These findings can be used to develop support programs tailored to the needs of athletes according to their profile.

AB This paper contains a theoretical reflection about the methodology and meaning given to the global city rankings. There is a very large academic production about the role that some cities have in global territorial processes, which has been related to the concept of global city. Many recent contributions from the mass media, advertising and consulting services must be considered also in the analysis. All of them have included new indicators in order to show the main role that cultural services have acquired in the urban economy. Also the city rankings are being used as a tool in neoliberal policies. These policies stress the position that cities have in the rankings, which are used in practices of city-branding and to justify the neoliberal decisions that are being taken. In fact, we think that rankings are used inappropriately and that it is necessary a deep and new reflection about them.

DE Comparative Education; Educational Reform; External Tests; High-Stakes;
   LOMCE; School Law
AB High-stake tests, which students need to pass in order to gain a Secondary education certificate, have aroused a lot of controversy whenever they have been implemented. Especially in the USA these tests have produced a dramatic shrinking of school knowledge as they have been focused into questions posed by the very tests. At the same time, there has been a critical modification of the learning processes due to the fact that these tests encourage students to pay more attention to factual knowledge, which is far away from hands-on learning, debating in class or working in teams. In spite of certain discrepancies, by and large, research casts serious doubts about whether these tests are conductive to better academic performance. Nevertheless, the dropout rate is on the rise. More often than not, school principals have been found preventing struggling students to sit the exams. A review of the research into this matter allows us to put into context the debate surrounding external exams posed by the current education law (LOMCE: Law for the Improvement of Educational Quality) passed by the parliamentary majority of the Popular Party in Spain in 2013.

TI TIME AND INEQUALITY IN LABOR AND FAMILY DYNAMICS
SO REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE SOCIOLOGIA
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Flexibility; Gender; Social policy; Time use; Work-Family Balance
AB The social changes in last decades have modified the time use of individuals. However, how time is used varies according to the position occupied within the social structure. This paper argues that the social inequality in the power over the time use is increasing among different socioeconomic statuses, while social policies are failing in their equalizer potential. To do so, this essay critically synthetizes three recent published books covering the cases of United States, France and Spain. Three elements that shape the social organization of time are being discussed: (a) the dependency among different social groups in time's control and the endo-geneity between family time and work time; (b) the am-bivalence of flexibility regarding its relation with gender and socioeconomic status; and (c) the need for a new assessment of the social policies designated to protect the workers' family time.

AB The knowledge economy has recently become a battleground between global cities. Activities related to culture, knowledge and technical knowledge reinforce the idea of the need for strategic spatial hubs and formal policies to attract people to cities by revitalising urban centres. To examine this process of gentrification in the centre of contemporary cities, I will review the remarkable importance attached to cultural production in recent times, which has led to the development of certain policies for attracting knowledge workers to metropolitan centres, thereby promoting the figurative distinction of a constructed "creative class". Finally, I will establish a dialogue with Bourdieu to help us discern whether there is a metropolitan social practice belonging to these new middle classes or whether the juxtaposition of these distinctive social practices is producing mechanisms that are contributing to the direct or indirect displacement of an unwanted population from places of increasing value.

AB This article aims to develop the aspects of Norbert Elias's work which deals on the physical-cosmological nature and biological nature for his understanding of society and human beings. His interest in the physical and natural sciences is found in much of his writing, especially those dedicated to the cosmological emergence of different levels of reality and those deals on discussions about human nature. That the role of nature in Elias is ambivalent and it swings between naturalism and sociologism, with points of contact and collision with both, can be concluded.

AB This article examines the democratic value of user-generated comments on the Facebook profiles of three Spanish candidates during the Spanish General Election campaign of 2011 through a content analysis that operationalizes deliberative democracy. The findings show that these online spaces do not meet deliberative standards, but that they still serve democratic functions, such as citizen self-expression, democratic socialization and reinforcement of social cohesion among party activists and sympathizers. Moreover, results indicate that democratic value might vary depending on the size of the party where talk takes place. Political conversation on the walls of he-gemonic candidates who belong to big consolidated political parties is mostly oriented towards self-expression and features some ideological diversity, so that individuals are sporadically confronted with diversity. For its part, talk on the Facebook profile of the minor candidate lacks fundamental disagreement but includes more in-group interaction, allowing minority ideological spheres for the cultivation of social cohesion and the construction of collective narratives in favorable discursive conditions.

AB This article presents an analysis of the political discourse linked to sport-related activities in the political parties' manifestos for the 2011 general elections in Spain. The coding system involves a content analysis of election manifestos and enables the identification of the ideological positions, preferences and main proposals concerning sporting and corporal activities put forward by political parties. The results of the content analysis revealed a homogenised discourse focused on the economics of health and sporting performance which advocated the amalgamation of corporal culture and environmental strategies. However, a number of parties offered a range of alternatives to this dominant approach. The findings highlight the main proposals for political action and hegemonic capital in the field of sport and physical activity.

This should offer a different perspective on the consequences of social movements by shifting the focus from single outcomes to processes of social change that are generated by the interaction between different types of effects. The variety of ways in which movement outcomes potentially influence each other in the short-term, or over an extended period of time, will be broken down into six hypothetical processes. Empirically, through a process-tracing approach, in this article I investigate how the British state's responses at policy level toward the disruptive mobilization of the Catholic community in Northern Ireland and to the armed campaign of the PIRA have shaped the post-movement lives of PIRA volunteers.

ID POLITICAL PROTEST; POLICY; AUSTERITY
AB A great deal of social movement scholarship tends to assume - and in some cases explicitly argues - that disruption is the primary mechanism through which protest movements win major concessions from the holders of power. Nonetheless, some studies and much empirical evidence provide a strong basis to argue that other paths to social movement success also exist. The importance of discourse and framing has also been highlighted in a number of studies but we argue that the full contribution of talk itself to movement success is best captured through the concept of "conversation" and an examination of the preconditions for its viability. The successful displacement of power-holders by protest movements, although a less common pathway to success than disruption and conversation, also deserves conceptual and empirical attention. In this paper we make this set of distinctions conceptually explicit, differentiating analytically between these three mechanisms of movement success and delineating the conditions required for each mechanism to prove viable and 'useful'. We rely on extensive examples drawn from movements and protest events in the United States, Spain and Portugal, using this empirical material, as well as the existing theoretical literature, as our basis for constructing a conceptual argument on the ideal typical distinction between these three mechanisms and the conditions that allow them to operate. We also take up the questions of whether, and when, movement actors can successfully combine these mechanisms or - alternatively find themselves pressed to pursue one or another of these pathways to success in a relatively 'pure' form.

ID EFFICACY
AB In follow-up studies of activists, activism has been observed to have long-term positive effect on political participation. However, little attention has been paid to the conditions under which the theory applies. I examine how the personal consequences of participation in three different protest movements in Sweden depended upon movement success and procedural justice. The results support previous findings suggesting that activism has positive long-term effects on individual political participation. However, several of the activists interviewed did not follow this general pattern, especially those who suffered unfair and discriminatory treatment from the authorities. The results imply that the effect of activism on political participation is determined by the perceived procedural justice, whereas reaching the preferred policy outcome is of less importance. External political efficacy is indicated to be a potential mechanism explaining the relation between activism and long-term political participation.

By analyzing the impact of certain technological activist groups on the implementation of the movement's demands in terms of mechanisms of participation and deliberation in the new parties through the use of digital technologies, we aim to evaluate the activists' contribution to the transformation of formal politics and the deepening of democracy. In this sense, we explore the role of so-called 'tech activists' as mediators of political participation, and the digital repertoire of action they use. Sources used include various documents and websites as well as interviews with key informants and notes from participant observation in meetings and assemblies.

TI DELIBERATIVE PROTESTS? Persuading politicians not to close schools in

AB Studies on the political impact of protest mobilization sometimes show that disruptive protests help social movements achieve their goals. This is conventionally explained by politicians' interests in re-elections and social control, ultimately neglecting alternative arguments such as the drive for better policy solutions. This study investigates if well-reasoned arguments - measured by the deliberative quality of protest letters against school closures - persuade Swedish municipal decision-makers more than simple outcries. Analysis demonstrates support for this argument, as schools defended by protest letters with a higher deliberative quality have higher probability to remain open than schools defended by letters of a lower deliberative quality. However, a fundamental paradox rises from the second conclusion: intrinsically non-deliberate forms of protests, such as demonstrations, have a stronger negative effect on the likelihood of school closures. Hence, well-reasoned communicative practices have some power of persuasion, but experienced activists may prefer disruptive protests for more political leverage.

AB The notion of the Creative Class and its interpretation of creativity, developed by Richard Florida (2002), have opened an important avenue of research and controversy in the international sociological scene. In this paper, we apply Florida's measurements to the case of Spain by measuring the three indicators that build creativity (technology, talent and tolerance), each of which is also composed of three sub-indicators. The data are disaggregated by regions and provinces.

DE Equivalence Functionalism; Functional Autonomy; Functional
   Interdependences; Social Differentiation; Spill-Over Effects
AB The success of the idea of social exclusion in European social policy and social work has no direct correspondence with its conceptual clarity and empirical determination. The usual connection of social exclusion with economic deprivation has much to do with this problem, which also hinder to make the empirical research in a form proper to the main features of this relational phenomenon: the multidimensional, cumulative and sequentially loss of social inclusion.
   The aim of this paper is to make a theoretical clarification of social exclusion from a (heterodox) neofunctionalist point of view, and from it to propose a methodology of research, in order to facilitate an empirical approach more adapted to the aforementioned features of this social phenomenon.

AB The phenomenon of globalization has important social implications that justify the need to study the intercultural communication of groups involved in migratory processes in the 21st century. The main objective of this work is to analyze the relationship between the intercultural sensitivity and the attitudes of acculturation and prejudice expressed by a sample of immigrants and natives of the host society formed by 255 participants, in the city of Cuenca (Spain). Quantitative analysis revealed that both immigrants and natives choose assimilation as their attitude of acculturation and that immigrants showed a higher grade of intercultural sensitivity. Natives that prefer integration manifest less prejudice while immigrants that choose integration exhibit more intercultural sensitivity. These results are discussed in comparison to those found in other studies with different social and cultural groups.

AB This article focuses on the collective members of political parties. Collective members can be defined as organizations having both full self-government rights and entitlements to decision-making processes in the political parties in which they are embedded. This article proposes a basic descriptive typology of collective members that takes into consideration their sociopolitical nature (party political or functional) and their pattern of articulation within the party in which they are embedded (whether they help to articulate the whole party structure or not). It also illustrates these subtypes by examining European organizations that meet (or are close to meeting) the main defining characteristics of collective members. This examination is based on the analysis of all parties that attained at least 4% of the votes in the last national parliamentary elections in 10 European countries. The article concludes with an analysis of the determinants and prospects of this type of party structure.

ID COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT; HEALTH LITERACY; EDUCATION; PEDAGOGY; RISK
AB This commentary examines the problematic ways in which breast cancer campaigns have conceptualised the concept of empowerment in Spain. It uses discourses and content analysis of seven campaigns to demonstrate how the concept has become the 'holy grail' precisely because it has been depoliticised. Two problems are examined. Firstly, it problematizes the lack of debate over whether current measures to promote the empowerment of women living with breast cancer actually achieve the desired ends (i.e., are they 'empowering'?). Secondly, it questions the implicit assumption that the ends necessarily justify the means is questioned -understood as content and format of these campaigns. It is argued that the current framework of cancer education is based on the traditional epidemiological model which is more concerned with coercing women to adopt changes in their lifestyle and comply, rather than promoting critical awareness.

AB The organizations' sociological characteristics have an impact on the performance of the innovation process. Therefore, knowing the sociological characteristics that best describe those ventures holding higher innovation results is particular relevant. Among these features, the culture of innovation in a certain context has been highlighted as the most relevant. This study aims at analyzing the elements shaping the cultural orientation to innovate on a sample of 441 firms within the Galician Regional System of Innovation. By means of multivariate methods, two types of cultural orientation to innovate were detected among ventures: a 47 % of the sample held a clear orientation to innovate, while a 53 % held a lesser orientation. The results showed the existence of a positive association between the cultural orientation to innovate and the innovative performance. Our evidence points out the culture of innovation as the duality capacity-attitude, i.e. potentiality-action. This opens new research avenues for delving deeper into the innovation sociology within the Regional Systems of Innovation.

DE Gender and politics; Spain; women MPs; regional parliaments
ID POLITICAL REPRESENTATION; NATIONAL LEGISLATURES; RECRUITMENT; PARTIES;

AB Using systematic criteria, this article offers a descriptive analysis of the evolution in the percentage of women MPs in the 17 Spanish regional parliament from 1980 to 2011. The fluctuating gender composition of these parliaments is analysed in terms of thresholds, patterns of evolution, and paucity of the changes. These dimensions, understudied in the literature on descriptive representation, are essential to understanding the growing feminization of the legislature. Three different regional models of incorporation of women MPs, forerunner, mixed and laggard, are identified, which provide valuable information about a) when the different ratios of women versus men representatives are attained, b) how stable or unstable the growth in the percentage of women is, and c) whether the changes are gradual or abrupt. We show that legislative quotas have a different impact depending on the specific regional model to which they apply. Considering the steady, comparatively fast and homogenous process of feminization of all the regional chambers, their relatively gender-balanced composition seems secure, as well as the attainment of the goal of parity laws.

AB Dunbar's social brain hypothesis constitutes an influential position among those that relate the evolution of human cognition and sociality. In this work, we first present the essentials of the theory and discuss the paleoanthropological and social evidence claimed to support it. We also point out its shortcomings, which have to do with the general strategy of finding linear relations among different traits, the lack of attention to the mental capacities that make human social life possible, and the diversity of social relations and structures that take place. We put forward our way of complementing Dunbar's approach by focusing on the role of trust in cementing society and explaining diversity.

AB A generalized approach in democratic theory exists, especially in participatory theory, in which the smaller the scale (defined as size of territory or administrative level), the more chance there is to develop better quality participatory processes. In response to this perspective, we will compare two types of Participating Institutions in Brazil (Councils and National Conferences) in municipalities of different sizes and administrative levels. The hypothesis of this paper is that intermediate levels are those of higher democratic quality.

On the one hand, three case studies as the French Revolution, the American Civil religion and the ritual mobilizations that follow the attack against the WTC in the 9/11 show us the empirical support to explain the emergence of multiple postaxial sacred forms. On the other hand, the modern resacralization of an other secular sphere, the human person, set off an other cultural dynamics. Finally, there have been analyzed two cases of modern societies where those modern resacralizations are projected as symbolic cleavages.

AB This paper studies the relationship between candidates and the electorate through a in-depth analysis of three political campaigns for the Chamber of deputies in Chile in 2013. Confirming recent findings, this article shows the dominance of non-programmatic or clientelistic linkages between the electorate and representatives which implies the transaction of votes for information, material resources and influence. The paper distinguishes two campaign strategies: a traditional strategy supported on historical patterns of intermediation, and a professionalized one which rationalize and makes an efficient allocation of resources. The study makes a relevant empirical as well as conceptual contribution to the study of the patterns of political intermediation in social contexts of social disaffection.

AB This paper is focused on innovation processes in rural areas. Its author pose that although these processes are encouraged of technical and technological advances, they are also oriented by the logic of capital accumulation. That is why the innovation processes has a political dimension. In base of this thesis, the author analyzes, firstly, the general innovation tendencies taking place in the Brazilian wine sector, and in particular the innovation experiences in the rural area called "Vale dos Vinhedos", placed in the region of Rio Grande do Sul. Also, he analyzes the governance system in this territory, paying attention to the organization of social and economic players, and their relations with the public institutions at the local level. Finally, the author analyzes how the financial capital decides to change its strategy and to remove from Vale dos Vinhedos to other rural areas (for example, Campanha Gaucha) when economic players find difficulties to increase the capital accumulation process.

AB This paper illustrates somehow aspect of the capabilities approach developed by the economist and philosopher Amartya Sen. Particularly it examines how the concept of freedom (as "opportunity") reveals unable to empirically and normatively adjust to the notion of freedom as capability. From such categorical contradiction is introduced a set of unprecedented concepts that, gathered to the largest social dimension of freedom, allow releasing from such mismatch. Conclusions are focused on the emphasis of social environment as state that far from its recognized influence on individual capabilities has potentially enablers' elements.

DE Election night forecasts; measurement error; multi-hypergeometric

ID FORECASTS; INTERVIEWER; OPINION
AB Countless examples of misleading forecasts on behalf of both pre-election and exit polls can be found all over the world. Non-representative samples due to differential nonresponse have been claimed as being the main reason for inaccurate exit-poll projections. In real inference problems, it is seldom possible to compare estimates and true values. Electoral forecasts are an exception. Comparisons between estimates and final outcomes can be carried out once votes have been tallied. In this paper, we examine the raw data collected in seven exit polls conducted in Spain and test the likelihood that the data collected in each sampled voting location can be considered as a random sample of actual results. Knowing the answer to this is relevant for both electoral analysts and forecasters as, if the hypothesis is rejected, the shortcomings of the collected data would need amending. Analysts could improve the quality of their computations by implementing local correction strategies. We find strong evidence of nonsampling error in Spanish exit polls and evidence that the political context matters. Nonresponse bias is larger in polarized elections and in a climate of fear.

DE Social Action; Social Movements; Strategy
ID RESISTANCE
AB This article explores the relationship between humor and protest through a study of the strategic use of humor in the Spanish indignados movement. By focusing on four forms of communication (placards, performances, internal documents and Internet communications) in Madrid in 2011, the article assesses the subversive potential of humor in the communication of demands, the internal organization of the movement, the recruitment of potential activists and the construction of a collective identity. At the theoretical level, the article draws attention to the benefits that arise from combining an expressive focus in the analysis of humor with another which sees this as an instrumental action of those involved. Results show that the Spanish indignados were to a large degree aware of a number of benefits associated with the use of humor that went beyond having fun and, therefore, organized several activities in order to obtain these benefits.

DT Article
DE Finitism; Rule-following; Theory of Practices; Wittgenstein
ID RULE-SKEPTICISM; SCIENTIFIC-KNOWLEDGE; SOCIOLOGY
AB The aim of this article is to show the potential of a heuristic approach for the analysis of the reproduction of meaning in practices -in short, of "tradition"-, which is based on the Wittgensteinian notion of "to follow a rule". To this end, the article develops the ideas of a number of authors who have stressed the importance of certain aspects of the notion of "rule-following" for social analysis. This approach to conceiving of the reproduction of meaning leads us to "rethink" the way in which we understand tradition. The article will argue that we should forsake an old concept of inherited knowledge, as prejudices or ideologies that "constrain" people. Instead, we should consider tradition as "guidance" and "resources" for practice. Although we are not always aware of the principles that we follow, it is up to us to keep or to change them -if we can.

DE Maternal Experiences; Hospital Birth; Interventionist Birth; Medicalized

AB The aim of this article is to explore, from the point of view of the women who have just given birth, possible conflicts between maternal needs and medical routines typical from interventionist hospital births. The chosen methodology has been a set of semi-structured interviews, and the result shows principally three types of relief aid: the asymmetrical interaction, technological subordination and the acceptance of "institutional-abused" praxis. The final conclusion is that we have a medicalized ritual influenced by passive obedience experiences, where the fear creates distrust, while the women wishes are moulded by the expert's. This fact is assumed by the women who have just given birth as inevitable, and they even demand it, as a result of the safety given by the biotechnological control, and once they have assumed the clinical discourses which present the childbirth as a pathological and risk process.

To achieve this aim, I am going to analyze elements of identity and development in the different territories, highlighting the essential role of stateness conflict. Deepening in that sense, the practical relevance of these conflicts is reinforced by his contingent nature, which will be developed and justified through empirical results attached to historical arguments.

Particularlly, the Catherine Hakim's thesis about erotic capital has brought to the foreground the value of the body within contemporary social hierarchies. The Hakim's questions are connected with another set of conceptualizations that try to understand the value of the physical interaction in our societies. The first aim of this article is to discuss the model proposed by Hakim on the light of the explanatory capacity of Pierre Bourdieu's cultural capital theory. As a second goal we wish, enlightened by a set of empirical data, to confirm if it is possible to note down links between body care, social class, age class and gender.

AB This article tries to provide a context for the Spanish ambitious regulatory framework of self-employment in force since 2007. Along with the analysis of its novelty and scope, the article questions the sense of a reform considered paradoxical for two key points. On the one hand, because it involves the regulation of self employment under a specific employment status with very similar features to the wage labor status. On the other hand, because this reform takes place when self-employment -that has historically occupied a prominent placein Spain-tend to decline. Instead of dissociating self-employment from wage labor, this article invites us to explore the relationship between these two forms of employment, considering self-employment not as the denial of the wage-earning society, but as a witness of his power, and his profound transformation.

AB Time banks (TBs) have experienced significant growth in the last few years in Spain and have been incorporated in the agenda of political parties drawing the attention of national and international media as a solution to the economic crisis. Nevertheless, there is scant empirical evidence about this phenomenon in Spain. After describing the role of TBs in other countries, this paper examines the structure and management of TBs in Spain and develops a taxonomy of them. Additionally, it identifies the goals TBs pursue and the reasons why users join them. To do so, this paper uses a mixed-method approach consisting of in-depth interviews with 28 TB managers and an online survey of users (n=270). It concludes that TBs are a social-political project rather than a utilitarian-economic project, identifying differences between Spanish TBs and those in other countries.

DE Face-to face interview; Interviewer; Item Non Response
ID SOCIAL DESIRABILITY; STRATEGIES; IMPACT; GENDER
AB Face-to-face interviews using structured questionnaires constituted the most common survey data collection method in Spain up until the year 2000. Interviews conducted in private at the respondent's own pace, using visual aids (cards) to facilitate understanding of the questions produce a very low non-response rate.
   This paper attempts to challenge the above claim based on the evaluation of two factors: the circumstances in which interviews took place (as reported by the interviewers), and missing variable values (due to said circumstances). Interviewers reported that 14 % of in-the-home interviews took place in the presence of others as well as the respondent, 10 % of respondents rushed to complete the interview, and 21 % answered the questionnaire without using the visual aids. As far as partial non-response rates are concerned, four of the six surveys considered produced an average rate of more than 6 % in the "don't know" "no answer" response categories. The rate of missing responses increases notably when respondents ignore the visual aids and/or rush to complete the interview.

AB Based on a qualitative approach, this article analyzes the current role of religion in Spanish prisons and hospitals. More specifically, the article explores the daily tensions and negotations between the Catholic Church, the religious minorities and the secular professionals working in these institutions. The complexity of the micro religious/secular dynamics, together with the mono/multiconfessional tension and the religious/spiritual divide going on within these institutions, demonstrate the impossibility of drawing a single model to account for the way in which religion is being dealt with in contemporary Spanish public institutions.

AB The aim of this paper is to explain the ecological behavior of individuals. In particular, the role that knowledge about the environment, values and intentions played in the realization of an ecological behavior has been analyzed. Previously, the measurement scales of each construct have been validated. A structural equation modeling was used to a sample of 497 individuals. The tested model explained 87 per cent of the variance of ecological behavior. Our results show that knowledge and values are able to generate, indirectly, environmental actions, mediated by intentions, while intentions have a direct influence on behavior.

SO REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE SOCIOLOGIA

DE Bourdieu; Economic sociology; Neoclassical theory; Reproductive model
AB We use the sociological paradigm of Social Reproduction, proposed by the work of Pierre Bourdieu, to explain the wage gap in Chile, in opposition to the Neoclassical economic paradigm, currently hegemonic in the analysis of wage differentials. We expose and compare both theoretical paradigms and describe the case study highlighting the peculiarities of the Chilean neoliberal model. We estimate the salary of the Chilean population in order to explain the explanatory capacity of both theoretical approaches. We estimate two statistical models using the National Socioeconomic Characterization survey (CASEN 2009), firstly, the Neoclassical model based on Mincer equations and, secondly, a model that tries to empirically capture the explanatory factors specific to the paradigm of Social Reproduction. The results indicate that, in the case of Chile, the Reproductive model has greater explanatory power than the Neoclassical model, both for the whole group of workers, and for each of the generations of this group.

AB This paper analyses the population aged 65 and over who do not live with a partner, in ten European countries participating in the four editions of the "Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe", from 2004/5 to 2010/1. Logistic regression for panel data is used to analyse the ratio between living with others and living alone (not considering institutionalised people). Controlling for age, sex, country of residence and observation wave, it shows the effect of educational level, number of children, limitations in activities of daily living and level of income. A clear regional division arises, being southern Europe the area with the lowest probability of living alone, central Europe in an intermediate position and the highest in Nordic countries. Coresidence is associated with the loss of functional autonomy, educational attainment and number of children. In contrast, a significant link with income level has not been found.

DE Multiple Correspondence Analysis; Philosophical Field; Sociology of

AB The latest research about the Spanish philosophical field between the late francoism and the democratic transition, pointed out the existence of two intellectual networks. On the one hand, an "official" section including the most scholar philosophers (e.g. Sergio Rabade). On the other hand, an "alternative" segment composed by the most vanguard thinkers (e.g. Lopez Aranguren). La filosofia espanola. Herederos y pretendientes. Una lectura sociologica (1963-1990) (Vazquez Garcia 2009) employed a qualitative approach. Our goal, using the same sources, is to employ a correspondent analysis in order to put emphasis on reliability over validity. More than 15 variables about 50 Spanish philosophers have been measured. The conclusions explores the differences and similarities between the results obtained with the qualitative and quantitative methodologies.

This diagnosis will be based on the sociological research works carried out in the last fifteen years. Secondly, to stand up for the thesis that these policies can only be fully understood if we analyse them in a particular economic, social and political context. This context would be made up of the articulation between several sets of social practices, which can be expressed by the concept of Social Employment Regime.

AB The aim of this paper is to analyze the factors that affect the birth of the first child after migration. In particular, we focus on family conditions and socio-demographic characteristics of migrant women at the moment of arriving in Spain. The general hypothesis is that reproductive behavior after migrating is closely related to the situation on arrival. At the same time, we consider that different family situations interact with individual characteristics generating different effects on the probability of having the first child. In the analysis discrete time survival models were estimated using data from National Immigrant Survey 2007.
   Results show the importance of marital status and number of previous children on fertility after migration, although there is some interference between family background and personal characteristics of the migrant.

AB In most European countries, the reform agenda on socioeconomic issues has been backed on social pacts throughout the last decades. However, the upsurge of the economic crisis has hampered this general orientation towards agreement and consensus. From 2008 and on there has been a transformation "from negotiation to imposition" which has been particularly severe in Southern Europe. In Spain and Portugal, the implementation of unilateral reforms by the governments under the surveillance of the European institutions has provoked the weakening of social pacts. The article evaluates the reconfiguration of the relation between governments and social partners in these two countries as a consequence of the economic crisis. It also analyses the emergence of a new dynamic of corporatist political exchange which combines irregular and short-range dialogue with confrontation.

TI RECOGNITION IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES Intergroup relations as
   second-order recognition
SO REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE SOCIOLOGIA
LA English
DT Article
DE Axel Honneth; Multiculturalism; Recognition; Social conflicts
AB Since the 1990s, the notion of social recognition has developed into a key concept for sociological theory. Recognition theory seems especially promising as a means of understanding intercultural conflicts, as the sociology of intercultural relations often addresses claims of recognition of a specific identity that is different from that of the main society.
   The aim of this article is to show that recognition theory can be used as a key concept in examining group inclusion in multicultural societies. Nevertheless, the existing theoretical approaches to recognition are insufficient for that purpose. Therefore, I develop my own approach to the recognition of minority groups as second-order recognition.
   The concept of second-order recognition helps analyzing, understanding and evaluating conflicts in multicultural societies. It allows conflicts within groups that involve a struggle for first-order recognition to be distinguished from conflicts between cultural minorities and the main society that involve a struggle for second-order recognition.

AB Mass media relationships with collective memory are the subject of ongoing debate; either they are blamed for immersing the audience into a fleeting amnesic present; or they are hailed as crucial mediators of remembering and forgetting in contemporary society. This article contributes to the discussion with a research about one of the ways television has to remember: anniversaries. The content analysis of Spanish news programs confirmed the regular broadcasting of anniversaries. These news narrate a version of history highly dependent upon the news program format, reshaping the borders of the subjects, countries and facts worthy of remembrance while legitimizing television as witness to history and as history narrator. Far from promoting social amnesia, this commemorative journalism allows television to get involved in the management of collective memory.

TI SECULARIZATION AND ACCELERATION. Theological foundations of the
   sociological concept "social acceleration"
SO REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE SOCIOLOGIA
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Acceleration; Historical Time; Modernity; Schortening
AB The term "time shortening" is related to the Judeo-Christian tradition that announces the end of time as the moment when God, honoring the elected, will shorten the days and hours, for without doing it no one would be saved. While salvation is, in this sense, associated with the divine intervention, the thesis of acceleration reverses the above formula by blaming the human being for having narrowed the time. However, if time shortening is aimed at the salvation of the world in the apocalypse, where does the acceleration point, that is, the secularized notion of time shortening? What justifies the increasing speed in the realization of tasks that formerly took considerable time and today are made in a few hours? How to justify the frenzy to get what is intended in the shortest time possible?

DE Clusters; Internet Use; Media Consumption; Social Structure; Time Budget

ID BUDGET SURVEY; IMPACT
AB Television remains the most consumed media by the Spanish. However, after this first statement we find a society with significant differences when it interacts with the media. A cluster analysis of the Time Uses Survey 2009-2010, conducted by Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, has found four groups or media diets. Every media diet articulates different amount of time of television consumption, use of digital media (computer and internet) and other media consumption in everyday life. This work also shows the importance in setting such diets of household income, type of household, relation to activity and age. Finally, gender appears not so much as a criterion to differentiate media diets as a criterion to explain the time spent on other activities within each media diet.

   optimism or school effects?
SO REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE SOCIOLOGIA

DT Article
DE Educational expectations; Educational Disadvantage; Immigrant optimism;
   Navarre
ID ACHIEVEMENT; DIFFERENTIALS; PERFORMANCE; ATTAINMENT; CHILDREN
AB In this paper we use the Evaluation Survey for Secondary Schooling conducted by the Regional Government of Navarra in 2010 to study migrant-native differentials in the educational expectation of students. Our evidence confirms the existence of what the international literature has labelled "immigrant optimism", in other words, the fact that immigrant-origin students are more ambitious than what should be expected according to their socioeconomic status or their prior school achievement. Once we identify this regularity, the paper explores the causes of this particular differential between migrants and natives suggesting that individual level characteristics (broadly speaking family level features) are the most plausible source of this optimism. The sorting of migrants in the Navarre school map and the school characteristics appears to be less relevant to understand this immigrant optimism.

AB Through a representative sample of 8.755 employees in 2010, and using a structural equations model (SEM), this article analyzes empirically the multidimensional determinants (direct effects) of the perceived work quality in Spain. The research concludes that the perceived work quality combines a broad set of explanatory dimensions that are linked with de workplace itself (intrinsic work quality, organization, access and inclusion, and compensations), but also with their environment and labor relations (social relations, work intensity, skills and training, and health and safety). Therefore, the public employment policies for ending the economic crisis should not only address the quality or workplace, but also meet the dimensions related to their environment and labor relations.

DT Article
DE Impacts; Risks; Sustainable Development
ID ENVIRONMENT; IMPACTS
AB Rural tourism is generally recognized as a booster for sustainable development of inland areas, but two research-actions would be necessary in advance: a local diagnosis of touristic processes and a risk assessment for those processes in affected areas. This article concerns the sociological and spatial risk analysis of urban sprawl in rural areas. As a case study, 29 municipalities in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula (formed as a "comarca", North of Huelva province) are considered. Urban sprawl has been identified by specific literature as a threat for sustainable development in touristic areas, in coastal zones and in rural areas too. Based on the results of previous diagnosis, and the literature on socio-environmental risks and impacts of residential tourism, two specific risk indicators are selected and analysed, in relation to local touristic models.

AB This paper applies a gender perspective to explore the relationship between the position of individuals within the household and the health-related quality of life (CVRS) among the population aged 30 to 64 living in Spain (N=13.258). Microdata from the Spanish sample of the European Health Survey of 2009 are utilized for this purpose. Multivariate linear regression models for males and females are run which include the following controllers: age, labor status, educational level, social capital, nationality and variables approaching individuals' objective health. Results show that, among females, the position within the household is more influential on CVRS than some other individual characteristics. This is not the case among males. One-parent family is the household position that penalize CVRS the most which stands especially for females. Among males, living (or not) in couple is the most influential factor on CVRS. Gender-related determinants are discussed.

AB In this paper we approach the study of Spanish nationalism (the nature of the identification with Spain) from the perspective of voters of different state-wide political parties. Our goal is to analyse how the profile of constituencies of these parties has evolved according to what we call the electoral footprints of Spanish nationalism. The analysis of the degree of heterogeneity of this electoral footprint and its differences across autonomous communities over the last decades, along with other differences in socio-political attitudes among their constituents, can help us to understand party's positioning on this issue and its treatment in the electoral agenda. The empirical analysis is based on sixteen several general population surveys conducted by the Centre for Sociological Research (CIS).

AB This paper analyzes the effects of family contacts during incarceration on recidivism and explores the mechanisms that relate these factors. A two-wave mixed method design is applied on a sample of men given prison sentences for ordinary acquisitive crimes in the province of Barcelona. The analysis shows that both the stronger family ties (with parents and partners) and the weaker ones (with other family members) may have a significant effect on the desistance process, through the mechanism of bonding (in relation to strong ties) or social support (in relation to weak ties). However, the results also show the limitations of bonding when not coupled with the instrumental support needed for a successful reentry. Additionally to quantitative analysis, qualitative analysis has been conducted to detail explanatory mechanisms, taking also into account negative cases.
