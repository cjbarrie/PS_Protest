ID HAPPINESS
AB Indicators of subjective well-being have gained only limited acceptance as tools for the social-scientific analysis of human welfare, mainly because they seem insensitive to variations in the socio-economic context. However, this apparent insensitivity has been established by research which has been limited in various ways. Using data on life satisfaction for 33 European societies which goes some way to transcending these limits, this paper identifies linkages between subjective well-being and socio-economic conditions which are both strong and suggestive of important insights about national and cross-national relativities in human welfare. Populations in the rich parts of Europe have high and relatively equal life satisfaction, while those in the poorer parts of Europe have low and unequal life satisfaction. Social inequalities within rich European societies seem to have little effect on life satisfaction but they have significant effects within poor European societies. Inequalities between European societies also have strong effects. These findings suggest that analysis of inequalities and relativities in welfare in purely national terms is insufficient. Greater weight needs to be given to cross-national relativities, since these are much more consistent with what otherwise seem to be puzzling variations in subjective well-being across and within countries.

SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES

ID POLITICS
AB Market principles are becoming more prominent in citizen experience of public policy across Europe, as a result of economic globalization and the Maastricht commitment to 'open markets', and cost-constraint, privatization and labour market activation pursued in response to the various pressures confronting welfare states. These principles (inequality, competitiveness, allocation through ability to pay) contradict those traditionally associated with social policy (equity, solidarity, social justice). This paper examines the impact of current changes on welfare values in the various types of European welfare states (including accession states), using international attitude survey data. It shows that most citizens remain committed to mild egalitarianism. Citizen ideology will thus continue to buttress resilience to pressures for restructuring in the various welfare state regimes. The paper goes on to consider the impact of social change by examining the values of groups with particular interests who are likely to expand in significance as a result of labour market and population changes. This analysis shows that change does not lead in one direction. There is every likelihood that tensions between market and welfare values will be compounded by social change.

ID LIFETIME JOBS; TENURE; INSECURITY; ECONOMY
AB In the course of the transition from an industrial to a service economy, fundamental changes in the functioning of the labour market are expected to occur. A number of authors assert that these changes will result in an increasing external-numerical flexibility of firms which is assumed to affect labour market processes in terms of a generally higher labour market mobility and a decreasing employment stability ('high-velocity labour market'). This paper examines the hypothesis of a growing importance of numeric-external flexibility, applying simple descriptive statistical methods to the event-history data of the IAB Employment Subsample for the West German labour market covering the years 1976 to 1995. There is no evidence for an acceleration of labour market 'churning', but rather for a stagnation or even slight decline of labour market mobility since the 1970s. Furthermore, job stability has not decreased over time, as one might have expected, but rather increased. In spite of these general results it might be conceivable that service-sector jobs have become more unstable but that this effect is cancelled out by a considerable stabilization of jobs in manufacturing. It turns out, however, that there is no evidence for developments in the 'old' and 'new' labour markets to contrast in such a simple way. Services display divergent trends when broken down by sub-sectors; jobs in some of them have stabilized while there is no or an opposite change in others.

ID GROWTH
AB One of the few cross-national studies, which contrast members of the EU with a comparable set of other countries as benchmark, suggested that membership is beneficial for economic growth and may cause faster economic convergence of less wealthy EU member states. Employing a newly collected data set on inter-state transfers in the EU, we test whether this faster economic convergence is due to access to the Internal Market (proposition of the economic logic) or rather a consequence of special forms of inter-state redistribution within the EU (proposition of the political logic). We find that if EU countries grew faster in the 1980s and 1990s (as compared to the benchmark and controlling for relevant growth factors), then this was due to transfers within the community. These benefited the poorer EU countries, which thus experienced faster economic convergence. This evidence suggests support for the argument of the political logic regarding Western European integration which we contrast with the economic logic. The empirical results are highly significant regarding the prospects of catching up for new EU members in Central and Eastern Europe. The decisions about the future EU transfer system will determine the chances for convergence for these countries.

AB The post-Soviet Russian society produces of a great variety of political parties, newspapers, and TV channels but this is not synonymous with democratic pluralism and/or the formation of a critical public sphere. This public sphere suffers from obstructed communication between the state and its citizens as one result of Soviet political socialization. This is not only a reason for fuzzy interview communication in the frame of scientific research in contemporary Russia, it is an important aspect of impediment to the construction of civil society. In our article we will firstly outline Russian sociological discussion on the specific Soviet division of the public sphere in an 'official' and a 'private' part. Secondly, we will suggest how to compare it with 'western' theoretical approaches to the topic by strengthening any non-dichotomous models. Finally, we consider the actual condition of Russian public which is still marked by a general distrust of the state and its 'organs', and recently coloured by false public forums threatening freedom of the press and freedom of opinion.

ID STRATIFICATION
AB With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the independence of Central and Eastern Europe, and the disappearance of the great polarity that separated East and West, the climate for sociology changed radically. Throughout the region sociologists found themselves with a new independence, free of the ideological and intellectual restrictions that had been imposed by state and Party authorities. In the post-1989 era, sociology entered a decade of reconstruction and began to take on a new role, helping to understand the transformations that occurred, as well as facilitating the social change they brought about. This article examines this recent history of sociology in Central and Eastern Europe with particular attention to deCommunization, institutionalization, teaching, theory and methods, topics of research, and international collaboration and influences.

AB The increasing integration of EU countries and the introduction of a new round of Applicant countries has created the need for more comparable statistics on indicators and more standardised statistical measures. Hence, indicators such as life expectancy, or GDP per capita have been used for measuring the 'progress' of Candidate countries in the Enlargement process, mainly as static measures like Gini coefficients, while the dimension of time is not well developed, In this paper, I argue for a new complementary kind of statistical measure, the S-distance, that would measure the distance (proximity) in time between the points in time when two series are compared that have reached a specified level on indicator X. This can lead to very different analytical and policy conclusions about the interrelationship between growth and inequality. In the empirical section a selected set of economic and social indicators for five candidate and three EU cohesion countries is compared with the EU15 average. It is demonstrated that the degree of disparities across indicators may be very different in static terms and in time. For all eight countries no significant correlation was found between the ordering of indicators by static measure of disparity and by time distance. This confirms that the new broader methodology can provide new insights from existing data and serve also as an excellent analytical and presentation tool for policy debate across many fields of concern.

AB The aim of the paper is to test whether the pupils of religious gymnasiums in Hungary have higher grades and a better opportunity to enter vocational college or university than comparable pupils of public gymnasiums have, For the first time the effectiveness of public and religious schools is compared in one of the former communist societies. Data are from a self-administered survey among 4th grade secondary school students in spring of 1998. Our results show clearly that pupils at religious gymnasiums in Hungary get higher grades and that they have more success in entering tertiary education and university. This is especially true for pupils at Catholic gymnasiums but there are clear indications that the Calvinist and Lutheran gymnasiums might catch up Catholic gymnasiums in the near future, if they get the time to develop themselves. A more selective social composition of these schools, higher earlier school achievements or a higher academic ambition of religious pupils cannot explain these better results of pupils in religious gymnasiums. We conclude from these results that the religious grammar schools in a post-communist country like Hungary are on average more effective than public grammar schools. This does not hold only for Catholic schools but also for Protestant schools, just as in other European societies.

AB The article explores how civil society is being used as a mediating device in relation to European integration. The increasing use of civil society NGOs in a productive relationship in the policy-making process and as a way of reducing the alienation and 'democratic deficit' amongst EU citizens is discussed, The article acknowledges that, while the concept of civil society remains contested, there are certain implications that need to be drawn from its contemporary resurgence: namely the need for wider political dialogue and institutional frameworks that reflect greater political participation. The traditional dominance of economic interests remains negligible of this, however, in spite of pronouncements by the Parliament and, particularly the European Commission that 'third sector' organisations will have a greater say and influence on EU policy. The paper concludes that many of the social concerns expressed by NGOs remain largely unheard or unacknowledged by European policy-makers.

TI Early exit from the labour market through the unemployment pathway in
   Finland
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE early retirement; unemployment pathway; unemployment pension; aged
   workers
AB The focus of the study is on patterns of early exit from the labour market in Finland with a special emphasis on the unemployment pathway. The period under review extends from the early 1980s to the turn of the century. The data for the study were obtained from individual-level files formed by combining census data with statistical registries of social security. The study takes a comparative macro-level approach, with comparisons being made between different periods of time. The results are interpreted from the point of view of the connection between early exit, increasing economic openness and structural change in society. In the 1980s, utilization of the unemployment pathway in a given branch depended primarily on how open the branch was to international competition. In the deep economic recession of the 1990s rate of exit was highest in the branches with primarily a domestic focus, which were hardest hit by the recession. The exit rates were remarkably high also in the previously public-sector branches recently opened to competition. After the recession, in 1996-1998, adjustments to international competition seemed to explain a great deal of early exit behaviour. From a broader European perspective the Finnish unemployment pathway, combining economic competitiveness and social cohesion, can be seen as an example of the workability of the European social model. The capability of Finnish early exit policy for adjustment in the face of changing societal and international pressures was further proved in November 2001, when a broad-based agreement on changes in early exit and old age pension schemes was achieved by the labour market partners in line with general objectives put forward by the Government.

TI Employment patterns and economic independence of women in intimate
   relationships - A German-Finnish comparison
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE gender; economic independence; care work; welfare state policy,
   individualization; reflexive modernization
AB In European societies there are some differences in the way and extent of women's integration into the labour market due to different economic development, political ideas and cultural traditions. In this paper two countries are compared, namely Finland and Germany, which differ considerably concerning women's employment patterns, employment prospects and their life orientations. While most Finnish women are participants of the labour force in full-time jobs, the working pattern of German women is of rather discountinous nature, depending on their chosen intimate relationships in private life, implicating their role as unpaid carers. As there is no sufficient provision of public care services, many German women are dependent on a male breadwinner while leaving their jobs for family purposes. In contrast, Finnish mothers return to their full-time jobs after maternity leave as the welfare state provides enough public care services for children and the dependent elderly. Thus it appears that Finnish women have gained financial autonomy and economic independence, a prerequisite for living in democratic, individualized intimate relationships with equal decision power. Even if, during the last decades, empirical evidence has revealed the transformation of the well known breadwinner model to a modernized version, or partially a shift to an 'adult worker model', in Germany there is still no evidence for a general trend to a fully individualized life pattern of women with children.

AB In Finland and Spain, marriage rates are equally low, yet cohabitation is rare in Spain and common in Finland. The fertility rate has fallen sharply in Spain, whereas in Finland it is relatively high. Spaniards delay childbearing later than Finns. These characteristics of family formation are not attributed to modern contraceptives, cohabitation or to the female employment rate. Neither women's labour market position nor family policy is the key explanatory factor for the differences in patterns of first family formation and fertility. However, the employment and financial insecurity of young people seem to be an influential factor having negative effects on the first family formation in Finland and Spain.

   employment
ID WORK
AB In this paper we examine the impact of temporary work on two dimensions of social inequality: income and career mobility. Additionally, we are taking a comparative perspective on this subject by comparing Germany and the UK. To investigate the effects of temporary work we use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel and the British Household Panel Study on non-self-employed respondents. The results show that temporary work does influence the system of social inequality: we found wage penalties and an increased probability of severe negative effects on the working careers of temporarily employed persons in both countries (net of education, age, and a variety of other covariates). Thus we can conclude that temporary employment represents a substantial socio-economic risk for employees.
   Most importantly, this holds true for both the German and the British case, two quite distinct labour market regimes.

DE social class; unemployment; comparative research; labour market

AB In conditions of increasing economic uncertainty, a body of social stratification researchers claims that significant class inequality in life chances persists (Breen, 1997; Goldthorpe, 2000). Can we find evidence of this, and are developments similar across countries? Differences in education systems, welfare and labour market institutions may have implications for class risks and class theory. Britain and Germany differ significantly in these institutions. Selecting the risk of unemployment as an indicator of class inequality, we investigate how this risk varies by social class in different cohorts in the two countries. Using life course data, we find that in both countries class is a good predictor of the risk of unemployment, though there is less of a difference in class risks in Germany. We find evidence of persisting inequality in both Britain and Germany. We reflect on the interaction between social class and labour market institutions for labour market outcomes, and discuss the implications of our findings for the theory and measurement of class.

AB A priori, Italy and France would appear as unfit for activation policies. Yet, when activation is seen as a diversified strategy of restructuring welfare states across Europe, and not only the 'activation' of individuals from assistance, then the empirical picture over the last 20 years is much more complex. One of the main differences between both countries is with regard to the role of the state, whilst at the same time they share many common features. However, French achievements in matters of activation seem to be important, whereas in Italy institutional features have consistently impaired the development of comprehensive strategies.

SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE activation; active society; citizenship; Denmark; Norway; welfare policy
   reforms; workfare; work orientation
AB The article discusses 'activation' in Denmark and Norway from an 'active society' perspective. The argument forwarded is that activation in the two Nordic countries shows continuity over the last 50 years, where Denmark and Norway have shared much of the same policy rationale or logic. At the same time there have been discrepancies in the activation opportunities, especially during the 1970s and 1980s. Such differences should be understood in terms of differences in the level and structure of unemployment in the two countries. All too often, changes in policy programmes and related 'discourses' have been evaluated without taking the changing labour-market conditions into account. On occasion this has led to too hasty or imbalanced conclusions. In part this has led to a misrepresentation of the relatively generous welfare benefit regime in Denmark during the 1980s, and in part to exaggeration of the alleged 'repressive' or unreasonable nature of the welfare-policy reforms in Denmark in the 1990s.

AB Current debates about activation policies focus only to a very limited degree on continental or conservative welfare states, as countries like Austria and Germany are usually assumed to exhibit a low degree of activation. However, active labour market policies have a long tradition in both countries. This paper analyses the development of active labour market policy in Germany and Austria during the last two decades with special emphasis on recent reform attempts. Against this background, the potential outcome of the central reforms is discussed. In spite of claims to 'modernise' the welfare system and labour market policies, current developments work mainly in the direction of curtailing benefits and rights of the unemployed.

AB In this paper, we examine the inception and development of activation in Slovenia and the UK in order to identify the rationales for its introduction, to plot the direction of reforms and to consider the outcomes of policy implementation for citizens. In this unconventional country comparison, we are interested in understanding third-order (Hall P. 1993, Comparative Politics 25 (3): 275-96) welfare state change as the context for the introduction of activation. The UK and, to a much greater extent, Slovenia, underwent paradigmatic changes in the goals of the economy, structure of the labour market and basis of social provisions in the late twentieth century. This provided the possibility for activation to develop a more distinct character and to be implemented to a greater extent than in other European countries. However, we argue that the nature of the activation strategies pursued in Slovenia and the UK have both retained strong flavours of their earlier policy traditions and point to the role of political institutions and arrangements in adjusting the demands of supranational organisations, particularly in the corporatist Slovenian case.

TI Unemployment, poverty and social isolation - Is there a vicious circle
   of social exclusion?
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE unemployment; social exclusion; poverty
AB The concept of social exclusion implies that there is a downward spiral in which labour market marginality leads to poverty and social isolation, which in turn reinforce the risk of long-term unemployment. The evidence in favour of this view hitherto has been largely restricted to cross-sectional data that assess the degree of association between labour market position, poverty status and patterns of sociability. In this article we seek to test more rigorously the implied causal argument by exploring the relationship between these factors over time. The article first explores whether the transition from employment to unemployment heightens the risk of poverty and social isolation, and then turns to the issue of whether poverty and social isolation significantly affect the length of time it takes people to leave unemployment for a job. It draws on data from the European Community Household Panel, which provides longitudinal data for most of the EU member states, for the period 1994 to 1996. The article concludes that there is strong evidence that poverty contributes to a vicious circle of exclusion. Unemployment increases the risks of poverty and poverty in turn makes it more difficult for people to return to work. However, there is no clear support for the view that social isolation is directly caused by unemployment. Rather the risk of social isolation is contingent upon broader cultural patterns with respect to household structure and local sociability, which differ considerably between countries. Furthermore, there was no significant effect of any of the types of sociability studied on the time that it took people to re-enter employment. The article concludes that a concern for the implications of unemployment for social exclusion should focus primarily on the problem of poverty.

ID OCCUPATIONAL-STATUS; TRENDS; RESEMBLANCE
AB We employ a three-level model - with siblings nested in families nested in societies - to estimate the variability in family effects on educational attainment across countries and cohorts. To perform this comparative sibling analysis, we use survey data from eleven countries and six time periods. The results first of all show that 34 per cent of the individual variance in educational attainment can be attributed to the family, leaving 37 per cent at the individual sibling level and 28 per cent at the level of the societies investigated. Furthermore, the comparative sibling analysis makes clear that there are significant differences in family effects on educational attainment between countries and cohorts. We find that indicators of modernization, individualization, and socialism negatively influence the measured effects of parents' socio-economic position on educational attainment. Total family impact does not vary with these societal characteristics in a systematic way, however. This seems to be in line with the reproduction hypothesis, which states that parents use compensating strategies to make up for the loss in effects of parents' socio-economic position on educational attainment.

ID WELFARE-STATE
AB Many politicians, participants in the public debate and academic scholars have regarded comprehensive welfare states as incompatible with the policy environment of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. Nordic welfare states are, due to their post-war history, suitable for testing predictions of the durability of comprehensive welfare states. The first purpose of this article is to examine previous research and official statistics on Nordic welfare state development in order to evaluate the proposition that comprehensive welfare states have been or soon will be forced to dismantle or radically reform social programs. The analysis finds weak support for propositions that comprehensive welfare states have been or soon will be subject to sharp downsizing or radical reconstruction. The second purpose is to explore Pierson's (2001) suggestion that cost containment and recalibration were salient dimensions of Nordic social policy-making in the 1980s and 1990s. The analysis finds support for Pierson's arguments. However, empirical evidence also suggests that Pierson's analysis does not sufficiently incorporate reorganization of services.

ID DEMOCRACY
AB This article identifies six main theories of the determinants of social trust, and tests them against survey data from seven societies, 1999-2001. Three of the six theories of trust fare rather poorly and three do better. First and foremost, social trust tends to be high among citizens who believe that there are few severe social conflicts and where the sense of public safety is high. Second, informal social networks are associated with trust. And third, those who are successful in life trust more, or are more inclined by their personal experience to do so. Individual theories seem to work best in societies with higher levels of trust, and societal ones in societies with lower levels of trust. This may have something to do with the fact that our two low trust societies, Hungary and Slovenia, happen to have experienced revolutionary change in the very recent past, so that societal events have overwhelmed individual circumstances.

AB This paper offers a cross-country analysis of street-level corruption. In line with earlier studies on general corruption (where data did not allow a distinction between street-level and high-level corruption, e.g. Treisman 2000 and La Porta et al. 1999), nine hypotheses based on general economic theories of law enforcement are tested using data from the International Crime Victims Survey (ICVS) held in forty countries (N = 27,456). The analyses employ multilevel logistic regression models. The results show that citizens living in countries with (a) high levels of economic development, (b) high levels of economic freedom, (c) long exposure to democracy, (d) a non-federal structure, (e) Protestant traditions, and (f) a British legal culture, experience less corruption. A relation between corruption levels and economic development, economic freedom, long democratic traditions, and a British legal culture, however, is found only when no distinction is made between industrialized and developing countries. As for individual characteristics, a higher risk of being victimized by corruption is correlated with a lower age and higher levels of education and income.

   dynamics in the EU
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES

DT Article
DE poverty; poverty dynamics; ECHP; welfare regimes
ID UNITED-STATES; INCOME; DEPRIVATION; INEQUALITY
AB Although many of the debates around social exclusion and cumulative disadvantage relate to processes that occur across time, there has been relatively little research into poverty dynamics except in a few notable countries such as Britain, the USA and Germany. This neglect is almost entirely because of the absence of comparative longitudinal data on income for other countries, but it is regrettable given the central importance of this area. By studying poverty dynamics we not only get a better insight into the processes leading to patterns of disadvantage and inequality, but we can also understand better the influence of different welfare state regimes on the social risks experienced by different types of individuals and households. The extent to which different national contexts protect their citizens from poverty persistence, or vary in the factors leading to poverty persistence, tells us a great deal about the workings of their socioeconomic systems and welfare regimes.
   In this article we use the recent availability of five waves of the European Community Household Panel Survey to outline the nature of poverty persistence and poverty dynamics across a large number of countries. In doing so we ask three important questions. First, is poverty a more common experience when viewed longitudinally rather than cross-sectionally, and how is this affected by the income poverty line used? Second, can we identify a tendency toward poverty persistence, and does this vary in its extent across countries? Third and lastly, what types of events are more likely to lead to entry into and exit from poverty, and does the importance of these events differ between countries? The article shows that the experience of poverty is far wider than is appreciated from cross-sectional data, and also tends to be more concentrated on a particular population than would be expected from cross-sectional rates. Moreover, the pattern of poverty persistence is congruent with welfare regime theory. The importance of country institutions and welfare regimes is also underlined by the finding that social welfare and market incomes play different roles in poverty transitions across countries, and that Southern European, or residualist, welfare regimes focus poverty risks on the experience of the household's primary earner to a far greater extent than Northern European welfare states do.

SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE educational systems; intra-generational mobility; social inequality
ID ATTAINMENT PROCESS; MOBILITY; ENGLAND; FRANCE; SWEDEN
AB This paper investigates the effect of intra-generational mobility patterns on collective social action. We start with the assumption that employees tend to collective action in pursuing their economic interests only if their social position is homogeneous, stable in time and characterized by privileges (or structural disadvantages). We believe that patterns of intra-generational mobility (and not only those of inter-generational mobility) are crucial for these preconditions of collective action. These conditions can come into effect only in systems of 'closed positions', where intra-generational mobility is restricted. In systems of open positions, a high degree of intra-generational mobility prevents the existence of homogeneous, stable and privileged social positions.
   In addition, the institutional arrangements of a given society, especially the educational system, determine to a great extent whether occupational positions are closed or not. In societies with standardized, stratified and differentiated educational systems, intra-generational mobility is restricted by credentialist allocation regimes so that the three conditions are fulfilled and patterns of collective action have a high probability of arising.
   This hypothesis is tested by an international comparison of effects on perceived social inequality using data from the International Social Justice Project (1991, 1996). It turns out that, as expected, in credentialist countries, educational titles and class position have stronger effects on perceived social inequality than in non-credentialist societies. But it was found that the economic system also plays an important role in the structuring of perceived inequality.

ID LEGITIMACY
AB The authors analyze how pro-federative representatives of the European Commission exploit the temporal dimension of identity construction within the EU. The paper shows, through the analysis of speeches and statements of Commission members, how efforts are made to construct a common past and visualize a common future to enhance common identities within the EU. The common past is invoked through recurrent claims that Europe is on the point of being reunified, and, most prominently, through references to the words and deeds of the Founding Fathers of the EU, notably Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman. This near past seems to make up the affective glue most counted upon to promote common identifications. Furthermore, the temporal dimension is used to invoke visions pertaining to the near future, here labelled the common near. Most often, these visions deal with the favourable and harmonious conditions to arise once the current enlargement is completed.

AB In spite of the vagaries of the common foreign and security policy and the enduring domination of NATO, there now exist a fairly large number of West European military structures. Recently, European countries pledged substantial units towards the creation of a 60,000-strong EU Rapid Reaction Capability, due to be fully operational by the mid-2000s. What did military officers in France, the United Kingdom and Germany think of 'European defence' before recent political developments took place? This paper attempts to assess the level of support for military integration among officers as well as the reasons and causes underlying their opinion. In particular, I demonstrate that, beyond cross-national variation, speaking foreign languages, having few soldiers in one's family, belonging to a 'support' unit, being highly ranked and believing in the virtues of international missions are significant predictors of support for European armed forces.

   institutionalization; rhetoric
AB The Protestant and Catholic churches in Germany embodied continuity in a country marked by discontinuity. During the forty years of division, they were the only organizations in East Germany to retain strong ties and organizational structures with their West German counterparts. Yet, the continuity that characterized the churches as organizations does not corroborate the stability of their values and self-definitions. Drawing on conceptual tools such as guiding metaphors and organizing principles, this paper looks at the debates that accompanied the re-establishment of the churches' unity after radical political change in order to delineate the conflicting conceptions of the churches' public role. The focus is on the work carried out by religious agents in either maintaining or changing these conceptions, a process we refer to as the 'politics of institutionalization'. Hirschman's framework on rhetoric enables us to reconstruct the debates to identify and compare the strategies and patterns of argumentation advanced by the actors in this process. Special attention is paid to the 'East German metaphors', or what is generally termed the 'positive experiences of the GDR and the "Wende"', and their defenders following the remarkable events that paved the way for the collapse of the German Democratic Republic and for German unification.

Findings showed a combination of modern and traditional reasons, which reflect the transition that Arab society in Israel is undergoing. On the modern side, over two-thirds of both the men and women endorsed 'did not get along' and communications problems, common reasons in the West today. On the traditional side, large proportions of respondents cited physical violence and interference by relatives - reasons which are more common in traditional societies, where divorce is stigmatized and otherwise very difficult. In addition, a sizeable proportion of the men cited problems of conception.

AB This article focuses on the caring function of the family in child care and elderly care and follows a comparative as well as a gender perspective. It aims at developing a gender-sensitive theoretical concept of familialism which allows to identify real world variations of familialism. Four ideal types of familialism are distinguished and care policies in the EU member states are classified according to them. It can be shown that countries cluster differently for different care policies. In addition, structural gender effects of the four ideal types of familialism are reflected upon. The empirical analysis of paid parental leave in nine EU member states gives an example of gendered and de-gendered variants of familialism.

AB This paper considers the reasons why a form of commodified care work identified as 'routed wages' has developed in many European countries over the past decade. These systems, which are often argued for within an empowerment discourse for the care users, are not often considered in terms of their labour market impact. The paper uses empirical data generated in a cross-national qualitative study of care users and their care givers in five European countries (Austria, France, Italy, The Netherlands and the UK) to outline the different ways in which different types of commodified care schemes impact on the labour market. It is suggested that the schemes differ in their labour market impact, depending on whether or not the scheme is regulated, and on the geographic, social and economic contexts within which the scheme is implemented.

AB This paper deals with the congruency between care payments and family culture in Flanders (Belgium). Our main point is that the idea of getting the informal care paid for by the care receiver is not supported by a large part of the population, notwithstanding the fact that the system itself enjoys broad support. Therefore we propose to make a distinction between the attitudes of the population towards any state measure that transfers money to the household on the one hand and the concrete practices between care receivers and their informal carers on the other hand. Moreover we propose to make a distinction between co-residents and inter-household care situations because the mode of solidarity is not quite the same in the two different situations.

AB That 'politics matters' has become a central assumption in the booming welfare state literature in recent years. Sometimes policies do not matter much, however. A key argument in this paper is that family policies are becoming increasingly complex and diversified, and that the practical implications of policies have to be analysed in relation to the wider social, economic and political context. In the present case study of a cash-for-care reform introduced in Norway in 1998, the relationship between policy reform and mothers' employment practices is explored. Against expectations, and after a heated and polarised public debate, the reform turns out to have very modest effects. The analysis aims at identifying the constellation of factors that can explain the unexpected outcome, locating them in the interplay of the reform's intent and content, and divergences between policy assumptions and mothers' actual context of social action.

TI Public payment for informal care of disabled children - Some dilemmas of
   the Norwegian welfare state
SO EUROPEAN SOCIETIES
LA English
DT Article
DE care wage; disabled children; welfare state; family policy; Norway
AB In many societies, responsibility for care functions has been transferred from the family to the welfare state. If this care is extra burdensome, however, it may be compensated by the welfare state by cash payment. Such 'care wage' raises several questions regarding family and gender policies, as well as regarding other principles of the modern welfare state in a process of change. This article describes and discusses the Norwegian arrangement of care wage for parental care at home for own disabled children (under the age of 18). It is based on interviews with recipients of care wage (parents) and with social service officers administering care wage. Data show that care wage is associated with several dilemmas of the Norwegian - and Nordic - welfare states. Care wage represents commodification of care and it is most often paid to the mother. Still, it tends to support a traditional gender role pattern, both in regard to care duties at home and as waged labour. This is in contrast to Norwegian family policies intended to enhance gender quality. Although termed wage, care wage is not comparable to payment for work in the regular labour market. Difficulties in determining the proper care wage in each case point to value conflicts as to what are family responsibilities and what are societal responsibilities for care duties. Further, the arrangement of care wage in Norway seems to pay only lip-service self-governance, and questions the autonomy of local government.
