TI THE IMPACT OF POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES ON INTERORGANIZATIONAL NETWORKS: A
   COMPARISON OF MIGRANTS' ORGANIZATIONAL FIELDS
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID ASSOCIATIONS; ENGAGEMENT
AB This article analyzes patterns of collective action in the field of immigration by looking at relational dynamics in two different local political settings. Drawing on a relational approach to the study of collective action, the general assumption is that the specific political opportunity structure (POS) in the field of immigration shapes the logics of interaction of migrants' associations. To test this hypothesis, we compare migrants' organizational networks in two cities characterized by two different opportunity structures-Lyon and Zurich. We thus apply network analysis to examine the density, the structural patterns, and the distribution of ties amongst organizations in the two cities. Results suggest that specific opportunities in the two contexts, by providing differential institutional access to migrant associations and publicly recognizing different collective identities, partly shape the relational patterns in the field and thus the modes of coordination of collective action adopted by migrants' organizations.

SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID GLOBALIZATION; MOBILIZATION; DYNAMICS; CRISIS
AB Protest campaigns consist of connected public events to which participants assign shared meanings. Data from thirty-one large protest events that occurred in Greece between January 2010 and December 2012-protests challenging neoliberal austerity policies and the "Troika's" bailout package-enable us to illustrate a network-analytic approach to identify those connections. We treat claims as the linkages that assign a common meaning to different episodes of collective action, weaving them into a coherent national campaign. We also examine the ways that events provide a connection between different claims, merging them in distinctive political agendas. Agendas evolve over time, and while some thematic continuity is essential to the existence of a campaign, this does not imply total stability in protestors' agendas. Data from Greek and transnational newspapers, electronic websites, and other media sources reveal both the continuity and shifts over the three main phases of the antiausterity campaign.

AB While social network analysis (SNA) has traditionally been used to study actor networks, it can also reveal "meaning structures" (Mohr 1998), the relationships connecting cultural elements such as ideas and practices. We argue that the repertoire of contention represents a meaning structure, analyzable using SNA of tactical co-deployments at protests. We use data from over 7,000 protest events in New York State from 1960 to 1995. Our analyses suggest that co-deployed tactics are not chosen independently or combined randomly but rather cluster into sets with distinct roles. These roles reveal cultural affinities among the tactics and are largely stable over time, although some variation related to the protest cycle and tactical form can be detected. We also examine the position of a specific theoretical category of tactics, radical tactics, within the larger tactical repertoire.

TI THREE PATTERNS OF POWER IN TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED CONTENTION
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID PEER PRODUCTION; ONLINE; PROTEST; WEBER
AB Technology-enabled networks of contention differ from physically co-present networks in that communication more saliently structures relations among actors. Technology platforms may even take on some roles of organizations in providing information, distributing resources, and coordinating action. Although many observers claim that online networks tend to concentrate public displays of attention and recognition in power-law hierarchies, we propose that technology-enabled contentious networks may seek or avoid concentrated hierarchies as reflections of the participants' underlying values and technology preferences. The article identifies three ideal type power signatures in technology-enabled networks-highly concentrated, moderately concentrated, and dispersed. Different power signatures can result in similar political outcomes, suggesting that none of them represents a generally more effective way to organize power in networks. However, in particular situations, different power configurations can affect how action is framed, how individuals become engaged, and the degree of fit between mobilizations and political contexts.

TI EMBEDDING DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS WITHIN COLLECTIVE ACTION NETWORKS: A
   MULTIDIMENSIONAL NETWORK APPROACH
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID DYNAMICS; PROTEST; TECHNOLOGY
AB In this article, we conceive of digital media as embedded within social networks, and use this perspective to examine the role of online communications in collective action. We claim that the adoption of this perspective requires two shifts: first, rethinking the ontological separation between media and social networks of action that has, so far, characterized research in this domain; second, the adoption of flexible tools that enable us to account, simultaneously, for the multiplicity of relations underpinning collective efforts and the hybrid interplay between direct and technology-mediated interactions. After discussing the necessity and the implications of considering communication technologies as endogenous to social networks of collective action, we introduce multidimensional networks (MDNs) as a suitable perspective to advance the application of a relational approach to the study of collective action, thus meeting the challenges posed by the diffusion of interactive and networking digital media.

   MICROMOBILIZATION; MOBILIZATION; CONTENTION; REGIME; ORGANIZATIONS
AB Studies of repression's effects on mobilization overwhelmingly focus on how severe repression affects the volume of protest, overlooking how activists perceive and experience a range of repressive tactics and how their tactical adaptations to this repertoire produce broader patterns of contention. This study therefore identifies repression's variegated forms and movements' corresponding responses using fifty-seven interviews with reform-oriented activists in Jordan, a "liberalized" authoritarian state, obtained in 2011. The findings demonstrate that activists (1) transformed softer repression into valued opportunities for communication with officials, and (2) responded to harder forms by publicizing repression through protests and their alliance networks, which persuaded the image-conscious regime to temper its tactics and prompted both sides to return to bargaining. This dynamic exemplifies a process of contained escalation, which helps to explain why Jordan's Arab Spring remained nonrevolutionary. I conclude by discussing the implications for studies of repression and response in illiberal contexts.

AB Scholars of social movements tend to regard professionals as a homogeneous group whose activism plays a secondary role in mobilization processes. In this article, I focus on activism driven by professionals themselves and therein examine how heterogeneous professionals participate in their activism. Drawing on the case of the Guantanamo habeas lawyers, I utilize a two-step methodology to investigate the factors that contribute to the differential participation of legal professionals. The first stage of analysis shows that while lawyers with higher status played a critical role in initiating professional activism under a hostile environment, the Rasul v. Bush ruling opened up a legal opportunity for lawyers with lower status to participate in activism. In the second stage, social network analyses of the lawyers' collaborative structure reveal that movement-affiliated lawyers played a bridging role that coordinated initiators and latecomers. The results have important implications for understanding professionals' participation in contentious politics.

It examines the causal path leading to a major shift in the intensity of a protest wave and argues that the transition is the product of the interactions between the dissidents, the state, and external actors. By studying the protest wave in Kashmir (1979-88), it identifies state repression and external support as the key factors driving the transition process. Time series analysis is used to analyze the original empirical evidence collected through content analysis. By providing a comprehensive understanding of the origins of the insurgency in Kashmir, this study shows that protest waves and civil wars are intimately linked.

LA English
DT Article
ID DIFFUSION
AB This article examines the tactical repertoires of two diaspora-based Chinese protest movements; the Chinese democracy movement and the Falun Gong, a religious community that has been banned in China since 1999. Data, which were collected and coded using quantitative narrative analysis (QNA) software, take the form of inventories of tactics used by each movement. In spite of general contextual similarity in political opportunity and context faced by both movements, the inventory data reveal that each movement had its own overarching "tactical disposition," which is understood as a relational pattern between challengers, publics, and authorities. Findings also suggest that the tactical dispositions of the movements initially formed in China and then migrated to diaspora, where they influenced further tactical decision making. The durability of tactical dispositions across such disparate political settings (e.g., China/North America) points to the role of within-group culture in shaping how movements respond to protest opportunities in transnational contexts.

AB Studies of the impact of social movements on government policy usually assume that the most effective strategy to win a reform is to directly pressure the elected politicians responsible for its legislation and implementation. We highlight an alternative, less intuitive way in which movements can exert political influence: by targeting the corporate and institutional adversaries of their proposed reforms. Such targeting can undermine their adversaries' ability or commitment to oppose the changes, thus relaxing the contrary pressure applied to politicians and reducing the resistance within government to progressive reform. We support this proposition by highlighting five instances in which mass pressure applied to institutional adversaries contributed to government policy change. Our analysis demonstrates that mass protest targeting large institutions whose leaders are not elected can be an effective and even primary strategy for compelling elected officials to enact and implement progressive policy change.

AB This study investigates how the nature of grievances can provide advantages or disadvantages to social movements. I use an experimental design to test the effects of loss aversion and omission bias on people's reactions toward grievances and the campaigns that seek to address them. The results indicate that grievances involving a loss are perceived as more immoral, unjust, and important than grievances involving a gain. Loss-based grievances also generate stronger emotions, increase willingness to engage in activism, and produce perceptions of greater public support. Similarly, grievances resulting from a commission (action), as compared to an omission (inaction), are seen as more immoral, unjust, and important. Commission-based grievances direct attribution of blame toward perpetrators, evoke higher levels of emotions, and increase willingness to participate in campaigns. These findings provide support for the idea that not all grievances are created equal in their ability to appeal to and potentially mobilize the public.

TI DOES FRAMING MATTER? INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON FRAMING IN TWO CASES
   OF INTRASTATE VIOLENCE
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID PATH DEPENDENCE
AB A popular current within frame theory holds that frames are more likely to "succeed" when they align with dominant representations of the political environment. These "master frames" are conceptualized as either endogenous to the protest cycle or as products of the political opportunity structure. In contrast, this article utilizes two cases of intrastate violence in 1990s Indonesia-"ethnic" violence in the province of West Kalimantan and "religious" violence in the city of Ambon-to show how long-term institutional processes constrain framing. Local institutions shaped both the perceived relevance of specific cleavages and the organizational resources available to frame articulators-each key to framing outcomes. How the resultant frames aligned with the institutional (religious) cleavage at the level of the state then shaped the alliances available to relevant actors. This suggests the need to reposition framing as a fundamentally institutional process, and as institutionally constrained on multiple levels of social organization.

TI COM/PASSIONATE PROTESTS: FIGHTING THE DEPORTATION OF ASYLUM SEEKERS
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID MOVEMENTS; EXCLUSION; DETENTION; EMOTIONS
AB Despite disadvantageous conditions, various forms of protest by ordinary citizens have emerged in Austria to stop the expulsion of asylum seekers. How can protest activities in favor of refugees be explained? Empirically, this article relies on a protest event analysis (PEA) of media articles and an emotion analysis (EA) of protest material. Following the emotional turn, this study emphasizes that personal ties and closely related affective emotions-friendship and solidarity-between deportees and protesters account for the most relevant resources of protest. Moreover, activists strategically use reactive/moral emotions-fear, outrage, and shame-to mobilize broader support. Protesters are mostly recruited from the personal environment of the potential deportees, and the most salient argument expressed against deportation is that well-integrated people deserve to remain in the country. The article concludes that social ties and emotions are useful in explaining not only the emergence and spread of protests but also certain limitations inherent in them with regard to policy change.

TI EVANGELICALS AND EMERGENT MORAL PROTEST
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SUBJECT
AB This article provides a comparative analysis of two religiously inspired protests that fed broader social movements: the "rebellion" of immediate abolitionists at Lane Seminary in Cincinnati in 1834 and the new-left "breakthrough" at the Christian Faith-and-Life Community in Austin in 1960. The two cases are examples of moral protests breaking out of Protestant institutions and shaping social movements. From the comparison, we draw general lessons about the meso-and micro-level processes of activist conversions. We show how processes of "rationalization" and "subjectivation" combined in the emergence of new contentious moral orders. We apply these lessons to help explain the creative interactions of evangelical Protestants in the history of American moral protest. Our approach accords with pragmatist and new social movement theories of emergent moral orders.

SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID COLLECTIVE IDENTITY; TRANSFORMATION; SOCIOLOGY; WORK
AB This article focuses on the dilemmic nature of identity for challengers within organizations and on their emergent responses. It is based on ethnographic research of one affiliate of Voice of the Faithful, a group of Catholics that formed in the wake of the clergy sexual abuse crisis. The abiding faith of the group and their commitment to change the church created a dilemma that encapsulates the central question of this article: how do challengers pursuing change of an institution balance commitment and critique, mainstream membership and otherness? Internal challengers manage these dilemmas by rescripting existing stories and telling novel ones to navigate group boundaries and formulate new understandings of their individual and collective pasts, presents, and futures. We trace the ways in which challengers work through contradictions and ambiguity in their emergent identities. This provides an opportunity to explore the existential dimensions of collective identity and focus on the processual nature of storytelling.

LA English
DT Article
ID POLITICAL MEDIATION; IMPACT; OUTCOMES; MODELS
AB We examine an increasingly common political tactic: the self-binding pledge whereby lawmakers assure a constituency, social movement, or interest group that they will take a particular position on an upcoming vote or policy issue. An empirical analysis of novel data on the 2011 debt-limit crisis shows that pre-commitment by legislators to the Tea Party's "Cut, Cap, and Balance Pledge" was the joint product of grassroots pressure and ideological sympathy. Highly conser-vative early pledgers opposed fiscal compromise that fell short of the Tea Party's position, while a number of less conservative later signers reneged by voting for the Budget Control Act that resolved the debt-limit crisis. The case of the pledge sug-gests that social movements are well positioned to collaborate with true believing insiders to promote policy change but have difficulty persuading fence sitters to take their side.

AB Relying on interviews with Jews who were interned in three Polish ghettos during World War II-Piotrokow, Tarnow, and Lachwa-this study clarifies the mechanism by which the perception of threat can motivate collective resistance. As these data show, the normal response to extreme oppression is a reliance on microsocial ties to secure survival; available resources are focused on the protection of those ties rather than committed to collective resistance. Under specific, contingent structural circumstances, however, an unequivocal perception of threat can align this desire to protect the microsocial unit with a commitment to collective action. In Piotrokow and Tarnow, structural factors counteracted the perception of immediate threat. The survival of the microsocial unit appeared to be best secured by individual strategies of action. In Lachwa, the survival of the microsocial unit seemed to be tied to collective resistance, leading to a violent collective uprising against the Nazis.

SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; COMMITMENT; CONSTRUCTION; BODY; PAIN
AB This article examines how embodied experience and the accompanying emotions help social movement allies to forge collective identity. The analysis is based on the Migrant Trail, an annual protest event in which allies of the border-justice movement spend a week walking seventy-five miles through the U.S.-Mexico borderlands to protest migrant deaths. Original data include four years of participant observation, interviews conducted during the 2011 Migrant Trail, and surveys conducted a year and a half after the event. Findings suggest that embodied and emotional experiences help allies overcome challenges such as social distance from beneficiaries, a lack of credibility in the movement, and no lineage of resistance. This study contributes to an understanding of collective identity formation among allies and offers an illustrative case for the important role embodiment plays in the emotions of collective action.

AB Within the global garment industry the term "urgent appeal" is used to describe a request for action to Western activist groups for support in a specific case of labor rights violations. The urgent appeal system has become an important strategy for the transnational antisweatshop movement. It is distinct from the movement's other strategies because it directly supports garment workers in their struggle for improved labor conditions while simultaneously informing and mobilizing Western consumers about substandard labor conditions in the garment industry. This article explores how reflexivity in the use of this particular strategy, strategic choice in its implementation, and interaction with allies and targets affect outcomes for garment workers. It confirms the relevance of the emerging strategic-interaction perspective in explaining movement outcomes.

AB With the emergence of the Arab Spring and the Occupy movements, interest in the study of movements that use the Internet and social networking sites has grown exponentially. However, our inability to easily and cheaply analyze the large amount of content these movements produce limits our study of them. This article attempts to address this methodological lacuna by detailing procedures for collecting data from Facebook and presenting a class of computer-aided content analysis methods. I apply one of these methods in the analysis of mobilization patterns of Egypt's April 6 youth movement. I corroborate the method with in-depth interviews from movement participants. I conclude by discussing the difficulties and pitfalls of using this type of data in content analysis and in using automated methods for coding textual data in multiple languages.

AB Although "repertoire of contention" is a ubiquitous term in the literature, the concept remains undertheorized and untested. The crucial implication, I argue, is that instances of a tactic belong to one or a few lineages, each radiating from a single invention and comprising a series of adoptions and repetitions. This implication is tested by examining suicide protest: killing oneself, without harming others, for a collective cause. The decline in cruel public punishment and the growth of news media increased the potential utility of this tactic. There were multiple inventions of suicide protest, but only in Japan was there a recognizable lineage in the early twentieth century. The sacrifice of a Vietnamese monk in 1963 created a model, which was adopted in many different countries for varied collective causes. Almost all subsequent acts can be traced-directly or indirectly-back to this origin.

AB Social movement consequences have become an increasingly important area of study, but the current literature overlooks implementation and treats law, organizations, and culture as separate areas of inquiry. This study offers a new perspective on consequences by taking a socio-legal approach that considers how law is constructed and enacted in professional fields and how legal and professional logics intersect to influence professional decision making. Drawing on ethnographic interviews, surveys, and content analysis about the Emergency Contraceptive Pill (ECP) conflict in pharmacy, I find that professional logics largely supersede legal ones to influence decision making and that organizational positioning and perceived policy affect collective goods distribution. These forces diminish the power of pro-choice and anti-abortion laws as professionals interpret, construct, and ignore the law in daily practice. The concluding discussion emphasizes the importance of considering professionals as targets of social movement action, reconceptualizing collective goods and implementation, and using field theory as methodology.

DT Article
ID MOVEMENT; POWER
AB This article develops a methodological approach that draws on Goffman's original framing concepts of "primary frameworks," "keying processes," and "frame rims" to capture the influence of fundamental cultural templates in framing dynamics, and how framing develops sequentially among different SMOs in the dynamics of political contention. We propose that frames can be analyzed in terms of three fundamental components: collective identity (the subject), the collective action of the subject (the verb), and who or what the target of those actions is (the object). We use this structure to approximate primary frameworks of contention for two key players in the Palestinian national movement, and then trace changes in the subject-verb-object grammar as part of the keying process by which the movement, overall, increasingly embraced radical Islam. Our analysis traces the internal consistency of subject-verb-object elements of the radical Islamist collective action frame according to changing political opportunities and threats.

AB This article investigates the radicalization of contention in Northern Ireland between 1968 and 1972 using a relational perspective and methodological approach. Two arenas of contention, movement-countermovement interactions and the structure of political opportunities and threats, are examined to understand the outbreak of the "Troubles" in Northern Ireland. The evolution of radical contention is explored through Quantitative Narrative Analysis (QNA), an innovative method that systematically records social actors and their interactions within an event. Relying on computer-assisted story grammars [the Subject (S) - Action (A) - Object (O) sequence and their modifiers] to parse narrative data, 6,035 semantic triplets were stored in a relational database. Sequential network models are used to analyze the database and reconstruct the nature and evolution of the interactions among the main political actors involved in the Troubles. Four distinct phases of the conflict are unveiled through network models of violence, indicating how and when the conflict radicalized, and how actors shifted their strategies of contention. Archival data are used to specify how mechanisms of radicalization, such as hostile counter-mobilization, repression, object shift and boundary activation, engendered the conflict.

TI STUDYING ONLINE ACTIVISM: THE EFFECTS OF SAMPLING DESIGN ON FINDINGS
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID INTERNET; ORGANIZATIONS; TACTICS
AB Social movement scholars are increasingly interested in Internet activism but have struggled to find robust methods for identifying cases, particularly representative samples of online protest content, given that no population list exists. This article reviews early approaches to this problem, focusing on three recent case sampling designs that attempt to address this problem. The first approach purposively samples from an organizationally based sampling frame. The second approach randomly samples from a SMO-based sampling frame. The third approach mimics user routines to identify populations of "reachable" websites on a given topic, which are then randomly sampled. For each approach, I examine the sampling frame and sampling method to understand how cases were selected, outline the assumptions built into the overall sampling design, and discuss an exemplary research project employing each design. Comparisons of findings from these exemplar studies indicate that sampling designs are extremely consequential. I close by recommending best practices.

AB We advance an understanding of the dynamic relationship between social movements, culture, and change by identifying and illustrating cultural revitalization and fabrication as two important cultural change processes. We also suggest that they are linked to and facilitated by the interpretive processes of frame articulation and elaboration. Analytically, cultural revitalizations and fabrications are the processes to be explained, whereas frame articulation and elaboration are the explanatory mechanisms. Both sets of processes and their intersection are empirically illustrated with a variety of case materials drawn from social and religious movements throughout history, ranging from early Christianity to the contemporary white racialist movement.

AB Studies have found that participation in social movements has long-term consequences for individuals' personal life choices and political beliefs. An important but understudied subject in this literature is the impact of past activism on political behavior in an institutional context. The entry of past activists into Korea's National Assembly offers a unique opportunity to assess the continuing effects of movement participation in the context of institutional politics. Analyzing roll call data related to Korea's participation in the Iraq War, we explore the relative effects of movement participation and institutional pressure after accounting for legislators' current ideological positions. Results from regression analyses show that while party and ideology remain strong predictors of voting behavior, past participation in social movements continues to influence political action. This study extends the scope of research on the consequences of social movements by pointing to the impact of movement participation on political behavior in an institutional setting.

AB Extant social movement research emphasizes the nexus of gender and opportunity structures in a variety of contexts, yet little work has examined how gender mediates the effects of structural opportunities on activism over time. We advance the existing literature by examining environmental activism framed around motherhood in pre- and post-revolutionary Czech Republic. Our analysis draws from rich qualitative data, collected over a ten-year span, which highlight temporal changes in mother activism in these two distinct eras. Contrary to expectation, gendered opportunities for mother activists expanded during the repressive era of the communist regime and contracted following the 1989 velvet revolution. We show how and why these dynamics occurred, and conclude by discussing implications for future social movement research on gender and gendered opportunities.

AB Scholars have recently begun to explore more nuanced ways of looking at the links between protest and repression, including consideration of the regime and other structural impacts on this dynamic relationship. This work contributes to this growing literature by employing Cox proportional hazards models to analyze daily data from 98 countries to study the exchanges between violent and nonviolent contention and repression under different regime settings. Results highlight the importance of considering the political setting when examining the dynamic contention-repression interaction, the need to account for both contentious actions' effects on state repression and state repression's effects on contention, and the fact that regime type categories should be further disaggregated in order to fully capture the particularities of this complex relationship.

TI BEYOND THE USUAL SUSPECTS? NEW PARTICIPANTS IN ANTI-AUSTERITY PROTESTS

DT Article
ID NETWORKS; STRIKING
AB In light of the emergence of mass protest against the austerity measures taken by the Greek government in 2010, we investigate whether these protests mobilized just the "usual suspects" of left-wing trade union activists, or if a new protest generation emerged. Using a general population survey carried out in December 2010, we find that almost one-third of the adult Greek population had taken part in anti-austerity protests, but less than one in five had been first-time protesters. Comparing new protesters with veteran protesters and nonprotesters, we find that new protest recruits do not fit the expected pattern in many respects. In particular, new demonstrators are less left wing than veterans and do not differ significantly from non-demonstrators, thus fitting the model of "apprentice" protesters. For the recruitment of new strikers, on the other hand, factors such as trade union membership and support for left-wing parties are more important.

AB Social movement scholars suggest that coalitions comprise a significant and growing portion of all protest mobilizations. Such organizational collaboration is of great practical importance to the labor movement in particular, as unions struggle to succeed on their own in a difficult economic and political environment. Yet surprisingly little is known about the factors underlying the development and success of coalitions. In this article we advance literature on labor and social movement coalitions, bringing a comparative historical approach to bear on the problem and examining two influential and far-reaching labor campaigns that occurred in the U.S. South. Our argument and findings demonstrate the importance of the relative fit among coalition members, the vulnerabilities of collective action targets, and their interplay for coalition outcomes. We conclude by discussing the implications of the findings for labor and social movement challenges more generally.

ID CIVIL-RIGHTS; ORGANIZATION; REVOLUTION; DEFERENCE; NETWORKS
AB This study advances a new explanation of the Montgomery bus boycott, the constitutive event of the U. S. civil rights movement. It introduces new findings to demonstrate that Montgomery, Alabama, was unique in its segregation system, and that unrest among blacks emerged in the narrow time period between late 1953 and 1955. I trace the motivational origins of the boycott in worsening social interactions that caused a sense of abuse and humiliation in black passengers due to three main factors: changing ratios of black and white passengers on the public buses; labor-related issues that frustrated the bus drivers; and the impact of the 1954 Brown decision on the bus drivers. This study calls for a framework that conceptualizes and connects lived experiences and real contentious social interactions with the emergence of protest motivations and social movements. Accordingly, I stress the importance of distinguishing between causes that explain the emergence of movements and factors that explain the momentum and success of movements.

TI MORAL ECONOMY REDUX: SOCIAL PROTESTS IN TURKEY AFTER THE 2001 ECONOMIC
   CRISIS
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID FOOD RIOTS; GLOBALIZATION
AB This article examines social protests following the collapse of an IMF-backed anti-inflation program in Turkey by people who lacked the associational bases to voice their political claims. Based on the pattern of protests following a similar economic crisis, one would expect protests by organized labor against the government. Yet it was largely shopkeepers and artisans who took to the streets in response to the 2001 crisis. I argue that the Turkish shopkeepers' ground-level understandings of economic processes-their moral economy-were at the origins of these protests. Furthermore, I demonstrate that organized labor's failure to mobilize resulted from the decline of associational capacity and strength of trade unions. The investigation of the Turkish shopkeeper protests shows that where capitalist production relations and a market economy threaten institutions of livelihood, moral economies can be the determining factor of a particular group's mobilization to contest rules and relations governing economic life.

AB We investigate two questions regarding the effect of information on participation in labor strikes: First, how are social identification and trust used as filters for information? Second, we investigate how cross-pressures affect willingness to participate. Using a dataset of 468 union members, we test hypotheses about the relationships between information, identification, trust, and participation with structural equation modeling. Specifically, we find that information from and identification with the union are highly important determinants of participation. Regarding information from management, trust is the most important determinant for preventing workers from participation. We also find a difference between workers who have previous strike experience and those who do not. These findings indicate that workers use different mechanisms for filtering information, depending on the source of information. This is a new discovery in mobilization research.

SO MOBILIZATION

DT Article
ID LAW; GOVERNANCE
AB Over the past few decades, large law firms have increasingly integrated social movement causes and organizations into their pro bono practices. In this article, I examine the field of pro bono representation and examine the various types of organizations and social movement causes that receive large-firm representation. I find that large firms represent a range of social movement issues and that this shift has increased over time. My findings support the "social movement society" thesis that movements have increasingly become integrated within mainstream institutions and have expanded to include new constituencies and claims. However, I also find that large firms channel their resources toward some issue domains over others, indicating uneven representation across the contemporary pro bono field.

SO MOBILIZATION

ID PARTICIPATION; MOBILIZATION; NETWORKS; REVITALIZATION; RESOURCES;
   DYNAMICS; IDENTITY; CLOSURE
AB Social movement scholars have long recognized that participants in one campaign often develop a commitment to activism that inspires continued participation for years, even a lifetime. Scholars have identified a number of factors that inspire the development of commitment, including consciousness raising, empowerment, social ties and the development of a shared collective identity. In this article, we highlight another factor that the movement literature has thus far neglected: skills acquisition. Using data from interviews with participants in the AFL-CIO's Union Summer student internship program, we elaborate on the processes through which participation generates a feeling of empowerment, specifically showing that participants in an intensive movement campaign can learn concrete organizing skills which empower and inspire them to sustain their involvement in activism. In addition, we find that social ties are important not only because of the information and support they provide, but also because they transmit human capital. We demonstrate that those who come to an activist campaign with less experience, and those who participate in a better-organized campaign are more likely to gain activist human capital through their participation.

   INFLUENCE OF THE EX-GAY MOVEMENT ON THE SCIENCE OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CONVERSION THERAPY; AVERSION THERAPY; EFFICACY; POLITICS
AB Social movements frequently seek to shape knowledge-producing institutions, including those found within the sciences. This essay takes up and refines the concept of intellectual opportunity structure to describe factors that enable or constrain movement efficacy in these efforts. Based on interviews with key claimants, participant observation at conferences, and content analysis of media, scientific, and activist literature, this article explains how the ex-gay movement in the United States mobilized knowledge and protest to shape mainstream science. Since 1973, gay-affirmative policies in mainstream mental health institutions have increasingly blocked construction of scientific facts based on the pathologization of homosexuality. Yet, the ex-gay movement has more recently found limited success blending theological premises and science-based methodologies. Shifts in intellectual opportunities, including formal acknowledgement of religious diversity by psychologists, have led the American Psychological Association (APA) to incorporate some ex-gay movement ideas even as the APA maintains that sexual orientation, newly defined, cannot be therapeutically altered.

AB While most studies of the repression-mobilization relationship have focused on the impact of the former on the latter, recent work has shown that characteristics of protest can influence state repression strategies. This article corroborates recent work on the repression of social movements and shows that both weak and threatening attributes of protest events contribute to the "repressive coverage"-the likelihood of repression-of social movements in an authoritarian context. In addition, results from logistic regressions show that authoritarian states not only respond to weak-status actors and situational threats but also act strategically to repress social movements that challenge their political legitimacy. This article extends the scope of the repression-mobilization literature by differentiating factors affecting the repressive strategy of a non-Western authoritarian state.

AB We conceptualize mass media as a field of action and consider how a social movement organization's reputation affects its media strategy as well as the quality of coverage it receives. Drawing on an analysis of two organizations mobilizing around academic freedom, Students for Academic Freedom (SAF) and Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), we find that an organization's reputation is consequential. FIRE, which has a strong reputation, gets high-quality coverage and primarily uses this media attention to threaten its targets. SAF has a weak reputation and, consequently, uses alternative and organizational media to create opportunities to spread its ideas to a broader public. It does so by exploiting the linkages among media outlets and moving its ideas from smaller to larger news outlets. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this research for understanding the role of mass media in strategy, outcomes, and institutional change.

AB Extant research emphasizes the ways in which collective identity is negotiated within broader political and economic opportunity structures. However, the interplay between collective identity and the subjective nature of opportunities has been largely unexplored. We address this gap in the literature by delineating how conflicting perceptions of salient political opportunities can fuel animosity and threaten movement identity. We draw from a unique qualitative dataset on the Czech environmental movement collected over a ten-year span. In 2002, a group of movement leaders circulated a manifesto urging environmentalists to stage a coup d'etat of the Czech Green Party. Controversy erupted as some activists felt that the rallying call violated their longstanding independence from party politics. Our findings reveal that the movement's collective identity ultimately became fragmented as a result of activists' dissonant perceptions of this opportunity. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for social movement research.

AB Media attention is a crucial resource for demonstrators seeking to influence policy. This article assesses the determinants of television coverage for protest events. Police archive data for the city of Brussels is compared to newscast data of the biggest public and commercial station in Belgium (2003-2010). Results show that few demonstrations pass the television gates (11%). Above all, protest size accounts for newsworthiness. Disruptive and symbolic actions also attract the media spotlight, confirming drama and visuals as critical television news values. Whereas symbolism matters for media presence, it does not hold for headline (prominence) or length of coverage (volume). New social movements are especially likely to stage symbolic actions. As a consequence, their presence on the screen is less a function of their numeric weight in the street. Distinctive selection mechanisms are at work on the commercial and public broadcaster, suggesting that media ownership matters for news selection.

TI THE ARAB SPRING UNCOILED
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID YOUTH
AB If this special issue on Middle East protest had been published two years ago, it probably would have focused more on accounting for the failure of opposition movements than accountling for their successes. Since the "Arab Spring" emerged in the winter of 2011, however, observers have rushed to explain mass revolts in the region. This introduction to the special issue reviews some of the explanations offered for these extraordinary events, and finds that the factors that are frequently cited in these explanations do not map comfortably onto the sites of greatest protest in the region. The essay then suggests an alternative approach, one that looks past causation in an attempt to understand the lived experience of the uprisings. The goal is to examine how actors changed as they perceived the possibility of protest, how they made meaning of their lives through the act of protesting, or not protesting, during moments of exceptional confusion and stress. This approach focuses on the twists of history that confound social scientific explanation. One twist that is highlighted in this essay and throughout the special issue is the sudden prominence of bravery-the ineffable but potentially influential desire to engage in risky protest. Bravery is not a causal variable but a disposition that may appear and disappear with the vagaries of the moment, altering the micro-flow of events and making a noticeable, if tiny, difference in the course of mass protests.

TI THERE ARE WEEKS WHEN DECADES HAPPEN: STRUCTURE AND STRATEGY IN THE
   EGYPTIAN REVOLUTION
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This article analyzes the 2011 uprising in Egypt in order to understand how an entrenched autocratic ruler could be toppled in a mere eighteen days. Refuting arguments that focus on the role of the social media, or divisions among the elite, and the alleged neutrality of the Egyptian military, I argue that a revolutionary coalition of the middle and lower classes created a breaking point for the regime. Key features of this mass mobilization included the refusal ofprotesters to be cowed by stale violence, the creation of "liberated zones" occupied by the people, as well as "popular security" organizations that replaced the repressive security apparatus of the state, and strikes that crippled the economy in the final days of the Mubarak era. My research is based on participant observation in and around Tahrir Square as well as dozens of interviews with Egyptian citizens.

TI PITCHED BATTLES: THE ROLE OF ULTRA SOCCER FANS IN THE ARAB SPRING
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB For decades soccer has constituted an alternative public space in the Middle East. Largely unnoticed by international experts, soccer provided a venue for the expression of pent-up anger and frustration against authoritarianism. By the time the Arab revolt erupted in December 2010, soccer had emerged as a key nonreligious, nongovernmental institution capable of confronting repressive regimes. Nowhere was this more pronounced than in Egypt, where militant, politicized, often violent ultras-organized clubs of soccer fans-played a key role in the protests that forced President Hosni Mubarak to resign in February 2011. Since his resignation, Egyptian ultras have continued to play a prominent role in Egyptian street politics.

TI COLLECTIVE ACTION AND MOBILIZATION IN DAR'A: AN ANATOMY OF THE ONSET OF
   SYRIA'S POPULAR UPRISING
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID OPPORTUNITY; THREAT
AB This article addresses how and why the popular mobilization in Syria took off in the "peripheral" Dar 'a region. Accordingly, it focuses on the province's dense social networks involving clans, labor migration, cross-border movements, and crime. It argues that Dar 'a 's social networks were important early in Syrian protest for several reasons: (1) They served as sites where nonconforming views on Ba'ath subordination could develop and he shared. (2) They contributed to the transfer, circulation, and interpretation of information whereby the shifting opportunities emanating from events in the region were recognized and the regime's threats were framed in ways that compelled people to act. (3) They provided an important sense of solidarity and presented the background against which recruitment for mobilization took place. (4) Finally, they provided key skills and resources for mobilization to be effective. Thanks to their miscibility, Dar 'a 's dense social networks substituted for the role attributed to brokers in social movement theory. They effectively connected individuals of different origins and strata in an otherwise prohibitive authoritarian context.

TI THE BROKERED EXUBERANCE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS: AN ETHNOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF
   IRAN'S 2009 GREEN MOVEMENT
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID EMOTIONS; MECHANISMS
AB Based on ethnographic fieldwork and participant observation, this article moves from a microscopic to a wide-angle view to explain the dynamics of the 2009 post-election Green movement in the Islamic Republic of Iran: how it manifested, why it weakened, and who participated. After mapping out the protest wave, I make three main arguments. First, pre-electoral campaigns created spaces for interaction rituals of "brokered exuberance" among participants in public rallies that lowered perceptions of risk and spilled over into contentious protest after the election. Second, ordinary, non-networked Iranians utilized face-to-face interaction to broaden and recharge the protest wave, while Internet activism confused as much as coordinated the organization of street protests. Third, the social power and political orientation of Green protestors were connected to the increased relative size of the middle class in Iran, which had been empowered and enlarged through the state's developmental efforts over the past two decades.

TI ANTI-SEXUAL HARRASSMENT CAMPAIGN IN EGYPT
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID TRANSNATIONAL ADVOCACY NETWORKS
AB This article analyzes how, for the decade before the Arab Spring, the Egyptian Center for Women's Rights (ECWR) promoted women's issues and sustained its campaign against widespread sexual harassment in Egypt. The article also reviews ECWR's activities after the mass mobilizations of the January 25th revolution. In authoritarian states, the risks inherent in challenging the regime decrease the probability that challenges will ever emerge or, if they do, continue for any significant duration. ECWR's prolonged campaign against sexual harassment, however, belies this observation. Analysis of the organization's activities provides an opportunity to examine elements that promote contentious claims making in high-risk, neopatriarchal environments. We found that the depth and strength of networks at the local level played a significant role. Also significant were ties with national and international group, which where were partly facilitated because of tourism's importance in Egypt. Through these ties, the ECWR leadership guided the organization toward increasingly promising outcomes in a unresponsive context. This case illuminates how, in the Middle East and elsewhere, civic organizations that focus on women's issues can navigate high-risk environments, whether due to neopatriarchal culture, authoritarian governance, or both.

TI THE INDEPENDENT PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF PARTICIPATION IN DEMONSTRATIONS
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID PROTEST; MOVEMENT
AB Street demonstrations have received the lion's share of scholarly attention to collective action. This article starts by returning to this research in order to raise some methodological questions about how to collect data on demonstrations and on the validity of the subsequent results. Next, based on my own research on demonstrations, I suggest some questions that deserve to be analyzed. In particular, I argue that we should work more on the psychological effects of participation in demonstrations. One potential line of investigation would be to more systematically explore the socializing effects of political events. Indeed, vivid political events should be important catalysts because they can have significant effects. Events may have an impact at any age but socializing effects will differ based on one's position in the life cycle, from conversion for younger participants to substantiation for older participants. I hypothesize, in line with Mannheim's (1952) "impressionable years" model of socialization research, that people especially recall events as important if they happened in their adolescence or early adulthood.

TI EXPLAINING DIFFERENTIAL PROTEST PARTICIPATION: NOVICES, RETURNERS,
   REPEATERS, AND STALWARTS
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID FARMERS PROTEST; COMMITMENT; IDENTITY; IDENTIFICATION; RECRUITMENT;
   PERSISTENCE; MOVEMENTS
AB Protest participation scholarship tends to focus on the special characteristics of novices and the highly committed, underplaying the significance of those in between. In this article, we fill a lacuna in the literature by refocusing attention on four different types of protesters: novices, returners, repeaters, and stalwarts. Employing data from protest surveys of demonstrations that took place in seven European countries (2009-2010), we test whether these types of protesters are differentiated by biographical-structural availability and/or psychological-attitudinal engagement. Our results suggest that biographical availability distinguishes our four groups, but not as a matter of degree. Few indicators of structural availability distinguish between the groups of protesters, and emotional factors do not distinguish between them at all. Some political engagement factors suggest similarity between novices and returners. This confirms the need to avoid treating protesters as a homogenous group and reinforces the importance of assessing the contributions of diverse factors to sustaining "protest politics."

DT Article
ID POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES; COLLECTIVE ACTION; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS;
   UNITED-STATES; PROTEST; MOBILIZATION; DEMOCRACIES
AB In this article, we argue that there is an element of rituality in all political demonstrations. This rituality can be either primarily oriented toward the past and designed to consolidate the configuration of political power-hence official-or oriented towards the future and focused on challenging existing power structures-hence oppositional. We apply this conceptual framework in a comparison of May Day demonstrations in Belgium, Switzerland, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom in 2010. The demonstrations display significant differences in terms of officiality and oppositionality. Our study provides strong evidence that these differences cannot be explained solely-if at all-by stable elements of the national political opportunity structures. Instead, differences in degrees of oppositionality and officiality among May Day demonstrations should be primarily understood in terms of cultural traditions in combination with volatile factors such as the political orientation of the incumbent government and the level of grievances.

TI TRANSNATIONAL COLLECTIVE IDENTIFICATION: MAY DAY AND CLIMATE CHANGE
   PROTESTERS' IDENTIFICATION WITH SIMILAR PROTEST EVENTS IN OTHER
   COUNTRIES

LA English
DT Article
ID MOBILIZATION
AB Why do some people participating in transnational protest events identify with their foreign counterparts while others participating in the same events do not? We find that participants in a series of May Day and climate change events are aware that the events are part of a broader struggle, and many in fact identifiy with their overseas counterparts. However, there are differences between demonstrations. Some are populated with people who identify, transnationally, while others are comprised of participants who more closely identify with their national companions. Focusing on differences in transnational identification at the participant level, our findings can be summarized in two statements: (1) protest participation is a stronger producer of transnational identification than associational activism; (2) expressive protesters identifiy more transnationally than instrumentally motivated protesters.

TI HOMOGENIZING "OLD" AND "NEW" SOCIAL MOVEMENTS: A COMPARISON OF
   PARTIPANTS IN MAY DAY AND CLIMATE CHANGE DEMONSTRATIONS
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID POLITICS
AB We assess whether the distinction between old and new social movements still holds by examining the social class and value orientations of participants in old and new social movement protests. We argue that new cleavages have emerged from globalization, affecting not only electoral politics, but also contentious politics, and thereby having a homogenization effect on the structural basis of movements of the left. Moreover, we hypothesize that traditional cleavages, such as class mediate the homogenization effect of new cleavages. We look at participants in May Day and climate change demonstrations in Belgium and Sweden, two countries that differ in terms of strength of class cleavage. Results show that there is evidence of homogenization between old and new social movements and that this effect is more important when the class cleavage is stronger.

TI DESPERATELY SEEKING POLITICS: POLITICAL ATTITUDES OF PARTICIPANTS IN
   THREE DEMONSTRATIONS FOR WORKER'S RIGHTS IN ITALY
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS
AB Social conflicts tend to take different forms. This article compares three demonstrations on issues of social justice in Italy: a traditional Labor Day demonstration, a march supporting a general strike called by the largest trade union CGIL (Confederazione Generale Italiana del Lavoro, Italian General Confederation of Labour), and the EuroMayDay parade, representing a "new" type of movement. Focusing on conceptions of democracy among activists, the article stresses that the economic crisis is a crisis of representative democracy as well. Protestors on social justice and labor rights expressed extremely low levels of trust in government, parliament, and political parties; the lowest levels were found among younger participants. At the same time, this lack of trust is coupled with confidence in the capacity of the citizens-especially if organized at the international level-to take the world into their hands. Despite high levels of distrust, demonstrators believe that one must strengthen all levels of government to be able to address social inequality-politics must regain control over the market.

ID PROTEST; MOTIVATIONS
AB This article presents the theoretical underpinnings, design, methods, and measures of the project, Caught in the Act of Protest: Contextualizing Contestation. This effort examines street demonstrations that vary in atmosphere, organization, and target. The project particularly focuses on participants, exploring who participates, and why and how people got involved. Data are collected before, during, and after a number of demonstrations, and captures the entire "demonstration moment." We develop standardized measures and techniques for sampling and data collection at the individual demonstrator level and at the contexual level. Evidence was gathered not only from the demonstrators but also from police, organizers, and the mass media. Data-gathering efforts were standardized through identical methods, questionnaires, fact sheets, and content analysis protocols. The CCC project examines demonstrations in Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain, Switzerland, and Sweden between 2009 and 2012. Teams from Italy, Mexico, and the Czech Republic joined the project at a later stage. The project has covered 61 demonstrations and 12,993 questionnaires have been completed to date.

AB This article explores how variation in political embeddedness of social movement organi-zations (SMOs) influences the management of emotions. By variation in the political embed-dedness of SMOs, we mean variation in the strength and the number of ties between SMOs and the political establishment. By management of emotions, we mean the efforts of SMO leaders to evoke particular emotions among SMO members. Using data from protest surveys conducted at demonstrations regarding climate change in Belgium and the Netherlands in 2009, we find that protestors who are members of more politically embedded SMOs are generally less angry than protestors who are members of less politically embedded SMOs. The finding that this pattern is especially strong among SMO members who heard about the dem-onstration through an SMO confirms the assumed role of SMO leaders in the management of emotions.

AB Although scholars have examined the different pathways to participation in social movements, for less research has looked at the endurance of activists once they mobilize. This article specifically explores the relationship between the pathways to mobilization and retention. Our data show that both social ties and individual motivations play a role in mobilizing participants of social movements. Contrary to what one might expect, we find that those activists who were mobilized with personal connections were less likely to be working for the organization a year later versus those who came to the organization as strangers. We find instead that self-starters-those canvassers who entered the canvass through their own volition-stayed on longer. Although those canvassers who came to the job through network ties were less likely to be working for the organization a year later they were more likely to be engaged in other civic and political groups and they were more likely to he leaders of these groups.

AB We conducted pooled time-series analyses to assess how number and size of demonstrations affect the political agenda in Belgium (1993-2000). Taking twenty-jive issues into account, this study finds that protest matters for the political agenda setting. This study also advances scholarly understanding of the agenda-setting power of protest by showing that the causal mechanisms of impact are complex and contingent. The parliamentary. governmental, and legislative attention for issues is significantly and differently affected by preceding protest activities. The media act as an intermediary variable: media coverage emerges in response to protest and, in turn, affects the political agenda afterwards. Protests on some issues have more effect than on others: in Belgium, new social movements protests are especially effective in causing parliament and government to focus attention on the issue.

AB The creation and maintenance of strategically useful collective memories can be important achievements for social movements, yet not all movements will attempt or succeed in these endeavors. This article examines how the shared history of the German Democratic Republic's (GDR) gender egalitarianism project was forgotten in the unified Germany. Feminist activists faced many conditions that appeared conducive to propagating a collective memory of the GDR's policies of gender egalitarianism. Ultimately, however several factors militated against it: a politically and culturally hostile climate, perceived threats to the movement, the specific relationships between memories, and the timing of openings for memory work. For these reasons, a positive public collective memory of gender relations in the GDR did not develop in post-unification Germany.

LA English
DT Article
ID COLLECTIVE ACTION; MOBILIZATION
AB This article shows how a social movement organization focused on microcredit loans is able to mobilize a community against its own cultural practice of witch-hunts. Successful mobilization against witch-hunts are possible when two conditions are met: first, when activists are able to tap into microcredit groups' social capacity for collective mobilization (defined by ties of mutual dependence, reciprocity, and friendship): and second, when activists are able to use strategic framing to present a coherent argument about the congruence of microcredit and anti-witch-hunt goals. In this context a master frame (women's development) emerged that effectively forged the seemingly disparate goals of microcredit loans and anti-witch-hunt campaigns into one synthetic movement. In contrast, successful mobilization against witch-hunts was difficult in areas where the activists did not have access to the microcredit networks or were not able to strategically frame the campaign.

AB This article explores how Basque language activists in France have evaluated and engaged with European-level minority language policies in relative terms of "opportunity." Focusing upon the social construction of political opportunity from below, I consider how actors affiliated with a community-based schooling initiative cultivated a strategic stance toward the Council of Europe's Charter for Regional or Minority Languages between 1997 and 2007. Drawing upon qualitative case study data. I show how activist stances toward the European Charter were both motivated and minimized by their institutional containment within the French national state and the educational sector more specifically. The article contributes to scholarship by shedding microsociological light on the ways in which grassroots actors experience the intersection between national and supranational political processes in Europe. The article also contributes to the study of ethnic mobilization in Europe by shedding light on the underexamined field of linguistic-rights activism in education.

ID US WOMENS SUFFRAGE; TERRORISM; PERSPECTIVE; MOVEMENTS; VIOLENCE
AB We propose an explanatory framework for the comparative study of radicalization that focuses on its "how" and "when" questions. We build on the relational tradition in the study of social movements and contentious politics by expanding on a mechanism-process research strategy. Attentive to similarities as well as to dissimilarities, our comparative framework traces processes of radicalization by delineating four key arenas of interaction-between movement and political environment, among movement actors, between movement activists and state security forces, and between the movement and a countermovement. Then, we analyze how four similar corresponding general mechanisms-opportunity/threat spirals, competition for power, outbidding, and object shift-combine differently to drive the process. Last, we identify a set of submechanisms for each general mechanism. The explanatory utility of our framework is demonstrated through the analysis of three ethnonational episodes of radicalization: the enosis-EOKA movement in Cyprus (1950-1959), the Provisional Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland (1969-1972), and the Fatah-Tanzim in Palestine (1995-2001).

AB In contrast to prevalent theories of terrorism, this study develops a contention-oriented approach where levels and forms of political violence against civilians depend upon: (I) the strategies of combatants; (2) the means of contention; (3) the locations of allies and opponents; (4) the collective identities of combatants; and (5) the dynamics of contention, including whether or not representatives of paramilitary organizations are included in formal peace processes. Quantitative analyses of a multi-source database of civilian deaths taking place in Northern Ireland between 1966 and 2006 offer preliminary support for this approach. The study underscores the insights provided by theories and methods used in the fields of social movements research and peace and conflict studies.

ID IRANIAN REVOLUTION; TERRORISM
AB Particularly since the early 1990s, some white power movement leaders have advocated abandoning leader-led organizations in favor of leaderless resistance. We examine the events leading up to this call that illustrate how threat is intertwined with the adoption of leaderless resistance. Using a combination of interview and questionnaire data collected primarily from white power movement followers, we examine views on leaderless resistance as well as the use of violence to advance movement goals. Our findings suggest that while there is support for leaderless resistance, most respondents believe that this strategy should be used in conjunction with leader-led organizations. While most of our respondents supported the use of violence, holding this view does not explain a strategy preference (leader-led organizations or leaderless resistance). Respondents who feared infiltration were more likely to support leaderless resistance. Although not significant, those favoring an electoral-politics strategy were more likely to prefer leader-led organizations over leaderless resistance.

AB Despite the development of the political violence and terrorism literature, which has moved strongly forward in the past decade, scientific works on the consequences of armed groups are still rare. This article encourages cross-fertilization between the sparse studies of the consequences of political violence and the growing body of research on how social movements matter. First, we show the variety of potential outcomes of armed groups' violent repertoires. We then review works on the consequences of social movements and highlight lessons for the study of armed groups. Specifically, we urge scholars to look for the interplay of internal and external factors in studying the impact of armed groups. We call for a comparative focus that dwells less on conditions and more on the processes and mechanisms affecting the impact of political violence. At the same time, we acknowledge that the literature on political violence and terrorism can inform social movement scholarship. In particular, students of social movements should pay more attention to the potential economic consequences of protest activities, the international factors constraining their impact, and the life-course patterns of movements' targets.

TI INTRODUCTION TO A SPECIAL ISSUE ON POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM:
   POLITICAL VIOLENCE AS CONTENTIOUS POLITICS
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB Five lessons for future research on political violence may be drawn from the articles in this special issue. Researchers should (1) analyze political violence not as a sui generis phenomenon but as one form among others that contentious politics sometimes takes; (2) attempt to determine actors' own reasons for their choice (or rejection) of violent strategies; (3) take the "conflict situation" that encompasses the interactions of all the relevant actors (not single states, movements, or networks) as the unit of analysis for explaining collective strategic choices; (4) take the networks in which individuals interact (not single individuals) as the unit of analysis for explaining individuals' strategic choices; and (5) examine actors' decisions to eschew violence as well as their decisions to employ it in order to avoid overgeneralized explanations for the latter.

TI THE REMAINS OF THE MOVEMENT: THE ROLE OF LEGAL SUPPORT NETWORKS IN
   LEAVING VIOLENCE WHILE SUSTAINING MOVEMENT IDENTITY
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID PERSISTENCE; ACTIVISM
AB This article examines disengagement from political violence and the persistence of a movement identity as concurrent and interrelated processes. Our inquiry is based on long-term qualitative data on 90 individuals associated with twelve underground organizations in the United States and Japan during the 1970s and 1980s. We find that as armed activists face the challenges of arrest and detention, trial, and imprisonment, the network of trial support groups and defense committees that was central to their capacity to engage in violence at the peak of the protest cycle also facilitates the process of disengaging from violence as the cycle declines. The distinctive characteristics of this network (herein referred to as the legal support network or LSN) permit insurgents to retain a movement identity while disengaging from violent activity. The study contributes to a small but expanding literature on post-recruitment dynamics in marginalized, high-risk social movements as well as to research on disengagement from political violence.

ID SECONDARY CIRCUIT; URBAN-POLITICS; STATE; HOME; ORGANIZATIONS;
   REFLECTIONS; PREEMPTION; REVOLUTION; AUTONOMY; PLACE
AB While the social movements literature has increasingly incorporated sociospatial categories into its conceptual toad!, this article argues that tracing the concrete ways in which a particular category "scale" is mobilized as a stake of political debate helps us refine its workings in practice. Integrating research on the co-constitutive nature of law and political action, this article traces how efforts to pass antipredatory home lending legislation in the United States during the 1990s and 2000s resulted in a rescaled home-lending legal regime. Using judicial and regulatory documents, media accounts, and publications by advocates, government actors, buyers and the financial industry, I analyze the mechanisms through which this occurred. Debates about federalism, home rule, and preemption illustrate that involved parties attempted to "fix" a legal regime scaled according to their organizational strengths. Finally, this case illustrates how discourses around globalization and economic rationality inform the trajectory of legal debates.

AB Why did states in the US North abolish slavery? This question remains unanswered, despite nearly 150 years of historical work on the subject. To explore this question I offer two "firsts": the use of social movement theory to frame the research, and a quantitative analysis of an original data set to test the theory I contribute to movement scholarship by examining a number of themes neglected in work on the political outcomes of activism: movement-countermovement dynamics; the link between religious beliefs and religious activism; the outcomes of religious movements; and the economic interests of social actors. Results show that emancipation was affected by Quaker-led antibondage protests; the countermovement of the Dutch Reformed church; this-worldly and otherworldly religions; economic incentives; and political opportunities. Black protest had no impact on abolition, challenging the thesis of black resistance as a major factor in emancipation.

TI RURAL MOVEMENTS AND THE TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY IN SPAIN
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Scholars of Spain's democratic transition vary considerably in the role they attribute to movements. Spanish democratization is widely known for its successful elite negotiations and some describe it as an instance of democratization from above. For others it is a case of social movement activism creating problems for those elites negotiating the democratization process. Among those social movements, the least studied took place in the Spanish countryside. Rural movements played a role well beyond the standard accounts in two important ways. First, they challenged significant obstacles to democratization that elite deals had left in place at the local level. And, second, the local arena had major implications for the national scene. We trace the history of four rural campaigns that were a pivotal component of Spanish democratization. We conclude with some general observations on the role of social movements in imparting a dynamic character to democracy.

ID POLITICAL-PROCESS; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; UNITED-STATES; PROTEST; DIFFUSION;
   DYNAMICS; CULTURE; MEDIA; PROFESSIONALIZATION; ORGANIZATIONS
AB Recent scholarship argues that citizens in advanced democracies are turning to protests as a means of voicing political preferences. Advocates of this perspective claim that individuals;low live in a "movement society," where protest activity stands alongside more traditional forms of political participation. However, despite the theoretical advances associated with the movement society approach, comprehensive evaluations of the underlying claims are lacking. This study remedies the empirical gaps by assessing three arguments. First, are more individuals participating in protest activities? Second, are protest activities expanding to more democratic countries? Third, have protest activities become "institutionalized," as indicated by a shift to nonconfrontational tactics? Analyses based on cross-national data provide mixed support for the movement society thesis. More individuals are becoming involved in protests, end this trend is observed in a large number of advanced democracies. Yet, there has not been discernable shift toward the use of nonconfrontational tactics; indeed, confrontational tactics are becoming more popular.

AB The article examines how two reproductive rights coalitions in Peru adjust their framing by way of regular interactions with other collective actors. Qualitative data were gathered from the coalitions in the regions of Arequipa and Cusco. The findings demonstrate how the coalitions engage in framing practices not only among their members as they select and refine advocacy goals and strategies, but also by means of interaction, communication, and negotiation with a range of organized social and political actors. Through these interactions, coalition members adjust their framing of reproductive rights in response to what they perceive from other actors, taking frames from them and directing frames hack to them. These interactions occur within broader political and cultural contexts consisting of stable and variable opportunity structures. Thus, the coalitions' framing practices entail stretching favorable interpretations among allies and neutral actors, while pushing back the boundaries in which the Catholic Church leadership attempts to transmit its own interpretations.

AB How do reform-oriented social movements in authoritarian states get off the ground? I argue that authoritarian regimes can actually facilitate social movement mobilization by making it easier for movement leaders to form opposition coalitions. When authoritarian states experience a political opening, certain structural aspects of these regimes will ease the process of coalition formation. I describe three ways in which these states facilitate mobilization: (1) they offer a straightforward set of least-common-denominator goals; (2) they establish incentives for existing organizations to get involved; and (3) they enhance the role of protest events in building cohesion. To make my case, I analyze the Egyptian Kefaya movement, a social movement whose diverse members had never meaningfully worked together before and whose nine months of sustained street protests defied expectations that it would collapse under regime repression.

AB This article combines social movement and organizational theory to explore boundary definition in civic organizational fields. Drawing upon evidence from two British cities and applying network analysis to relations between organizations interested in environmental, ethnicity, and migration issues, we show that identities shape network patterns more consistently than interest in specific issues. While this finding supports previous insights from organizational and social movement research on the relation between identities and fields, we go beyond them in showing that the role of identities is pivotal regardless of the nature of local political opportunity structures and cultures. We conclude by discussing possible strategies for exploring the link between organizational and social movement fields.

TI UNBLOCKING THE PATH TO EFFECTIVE BLOCK MODELING IN SOCIAL MOVEMENT
   RESEARCH
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID NETWORK; ORGANIZATIONS
AB Key studies of social movement networks use block modelling to uncover movement network structures. While it is promising to see mathematical sociology techniques applied here, there are grounds for engendering an even closer connection between these two fields of study. The mathematical sociology literature recommends, for example, that analyzed networks should be complete and relatively dense, that some degree of deduction should be applied to select the "best" model, that levels of equivalence and/or error scores should be specified, and that reliable and appropriate algorithms and levels of equivalence should be carefully selected. Some dilemmas involved in block modelling analysis are demonstrated through block modelling analysis of interorganizational networking in Friends of the Earth International (FoEI). This illustrates that, in the absence of the robust analytical procedures recommended by mathematical sociologists, block models are unable to uncover the structure of social movement networks.

AB Past democratization processes revealed a rise of interorganizational collaboration between social movement organizations. This paper investigates this sociopolitical phenomenon by analyzing the conditions under which alliances form within or across social movement industries in the context of democratizing Korea. A negative binomial regression analysis examines the impacts of the political opportunity structure and the social movement sector on different forms of protests: single, intramovement, and intermovement protests. Statistical results show that various dimensions of the political opportunity structure render differential effects, rather than a uniform effect, on alliance patterns. At the organizational level, coalitions and organizational diversity positively affect all forms of protests. The establishment of a strong alliance structure broadly empowers movements by providing a locus of organizational interactions and supports.

AB Based on three series of protest surveys across nations, issues, and time, this study examines to what extent the use of digital media permits activists to sustain multiple engagements in different protest events and different movement organizations. We find that digital media use stimulates multiple activisms. Through information and communication technologies (ICTs), activists can maintain multiple engagements and manage weak ties with diverse protest and movement communities. The data also suggest that these multiple engagements and overlapping activisms effectively provide linkages to and integration within social movement networks. Core activists who are closely linked to protest organizations rely more on ICTs to manage their multiple commitments. Even activists less closely tied to core protest organizations can link to more diverse communities through Internet use. These basic patterns systematically hold across nations, across issues, and across time.

AB This article analyzes levels of protest mobilization in eighteen African countries by far the region least studied by researchers of protest dynamics. Theoretically, its goal is to integrate the role of organizational engagement into political opportunity approaches to protest mobilization. Empirically, it uses African data to test whether Western-driven theories provide useful insights for analyzing protest dynamics in developing countries. The analysis yields three major findings: (1) the more open and democratic the political context, the more individuals mobilize, although the impact of the political opportunity structure in repressive contexts is less certain; (2) the more individuals are engaged in organizations, excluding religious organizations, the more they mobilize; (3) the impact of individual organizational engagement on the probability of mobilizing in protests does not change across contexts.

ID CIVIL-SOCIETY; WORLD SOCIETY; NATION-STATE; NGOS
AB This case study of transnational activism against the Nu River hydropower dam plan in China describes a horizontal dynamic in global-local relations, whereas the predominant literature in social movements assumes a vertical or hierarchical conception. The forms and operations of transnational activism were analyzed in order to understand the connectivity of domestic environmental NGOs in China to alliances, venues, and discourses. The case reveals that the "translocal" nature of local activism helped create linkages with global partners and establish a horizontal dynamic of transnational activism via the development of transnational solidarities and local empowerment. Local activists today should not automatically be viewed as the bottom feeders in a vertical topography, dependent upon global patronage. The study proposes a preliminary set of observable and/or measurable characteristics for assessing the degree to which any case of global-local relations expresses a horizontal dynamic.

AB Recent work in the field of social movements has argued for the importance of threat as a factor that explains the emergence of collective action. However, threat remains poorly specified and understood. This article seeks to refine the concept of threat and its role in mobilization with an examination of Jewish resistance during the Holocaust. Our study design compares two cases where resistance took place (the Warsaw Ghetto and the Sobibor death camp) with two cases where resistance did not occur (the Lodz Ghetto and the Belzec death camp). Our comparison of these cases finds that mass resistance occurred only when and where Jews correctly assessed the threats facing them. We use these findings to identify five dimensions of threat: severity, temporality, applicability, malleability, and credibility. We argue that recognizing these dimensions and the ways they interact is especially useful for understanding action in repressive contexts.

With data from a survey of migrants' associations in both locations, we examine the degree to which embeddedness in networks of links with other migrants' associations and with autochthonous Spanish civil society organizations are consequential for the inclusion of migrants' organizations in policy-making processes. The results show that migrants' organizational social capital is critical in facilitating their intermediation function vis a vis political institutions and decision makers, above and beyond their access to financial and human capital.

AB This article contributes to the literature on social movements and on transnational collective action by analyzing the roles of brokers in processes of coalition building. Brokerage is defined as bridging initiatives that link actors that are separated by geographical distance, lack of trust, lack of resources, or because they are unaware of each others existence. This study is based on network data and qualitative research about networks of challengers of trade agreements in the Americas in the past two decades. Findings suggest there are different types of mediating roles and tasks that specific actors are expected to play in enduring coalitions. The experiences of Mexican and Brazilian brokers show that the roles of translators and coordinators are more easily accomplished and sustained through time than the roles of articulators and representatives. Paradoxically, it is when mediating skills are most needed that they seem to be hardest to accomplish.

AB Scholars of the women's movement often postulate that it dissipated after winning suffrage in 1920, but empirical studies about the movement's post-victory transformation remain scarce. We use the first wave of the women's movement to explore the conditions under which movement frames change during periods of decline. Drawing on political opportunity theory, we hypothesize that waning political and cultural opportunities for collective action should lead to a rise in individualist frames. To that end, we examine how a prominent movement organization's use of collectivist versus individualist frames changed over time. We conducted a systematic analysis of 1,735 articles from the feminist publication The Woman's Journal, spanning the pre- and post-suffrage period (1910-1930). Our analyses generally support the political opportunity framework, suggesting that trends towards individualization emerge during periods of diminishing political and cultural opportunities, which in turn challenge movements' ability to galvanize constituents for collective goals.

AB Popular opinion suggests protest has become ubiquitous in advanced postindustrial democracies. In order to assess this perspective scholars have increasingly relied on so-called protest surveys to gauge protesters attitudes and characteristics while in the act of protesting. This growing body of literature has neglected the design of protest surveys and has yet to systematically test the reliability of the evidence they produce. This study attempts to make a contribution on both fronts. After reviewing the available studies relying on protest surveys, it proposes a standardized method to sample respondents in moving crowds. The sampling procedure is tested in 22 demonstrations across a variety of issues and countries. Based on a series of field experiments, the paper puts forward a specific protest survey fieldwork method by which selection bias and response bias can be reduced to a considerable degree.

TI QUARRELLING AND PROTESTING: HOW ORGANIZERS SHAPE A DEMONSTRATION
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID TIES; MOVEMENTS
AB On February 15, 2003, about 20 million people around the world protested against the imminent war in Iraq. In the Netherlands, 70,000 people marched in the streets of Amsterdam. This study focuses on the organization and mobilization processes preceding this event in Amsterdam. We trace how the organizers attempts to form a coalition and the quarrels that ensued affected mobilization efforts, composition of the demonstration, media attention, and, subsequently, how and when participants were mobilized. We argue that, although infrequently studied, the specific ways that initial mobilization structures are formed are critical factors in the trajectory of mobilization. We use in-depth interviews with the organizers, newspaper content analyses, and survey data from participants to trace these effects.

TI BROKERAGE, MISCIBILITY, AND THE SPREAD OF CONTENTION
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID DIFFUSION; NETWORKS; MOVEMENT
AB Social movement researchers recognize the importance of brokerage for the spread of contentious politics. This study proposes a new classification of brokerage and identifies the main types of brokers depending on the subgroups to which actors belong and on the subgroups' miscibility. It also introduces the "diffusion and scale-shift paradox": contention spreads more quickly when brokers connect few groups and when they connect groups that are highly miscible: yet, contention cannot spread widely if brokers do not connect diverse groups and groups with low miscibility. The empirical analysis compares the spread of contention on the issues of peace and civil liberties. Results support the scale-shift paradox they show that contention on civil liberties diffused to more municipalities and shifted upwards to more states mainly because civil liberty activists built bridges between groups that were at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum and outside the progressive community.

TI MECHANISMS OF MAIDAN: THE STRUCTURE OF CONTINGENCY IN THE MAKING OF THE

SO MOBILIZATION
LA English

ID UKRAINE; ELECTIONS
AB This study evaluates the validity and causal weight of competing causal mechanisms that purport to explain a single set of choices (and critical turning point) within a contentious episode: the decision to participate in the Orange Revolution protests in Ukraine in November 2004. These protests were characterized by extraordinarily high levels of participation, despite freezing temperatures and the threat of violence. Using evidence from public-opinion surveys and eyewitness accounts, the study shows how causal processes unfolded and accumulated and at several levels (structural, conjunctural, endogenous). Overall, participation represented more a short-term fluctuation than a general shift in societal values and behaviors, was fueled more by a long train of abuses than by suddenly imposed grievances, and was aided by a robust form of electoral campaigning. Events functioned as occasions for crafting together a diverse coalition of participants motivated by a variety of concerns- national, economic, and civic.

   MOVEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES, 2007-2009
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID COLLECTIVE ACTION; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; IRAQ WAR; BEHAVIOR; ECONOMY
AB Changes in threats perceived by activists, partisan identification, and coalition brokerage are three mechanisms that help to explain the demobilization of the antiwar movement in the United States from 2007 to 2009. Drawing upon 5,398 surveys of demonstrators at antiwar protests, interviews with movement leaders, and ethnographic observation, this article argues that the antiwar movement demobilized as Democrats, who had been motivated to participate by anti-Republican sentiments, withdrew from antiwar protests when the Democratic Party achieved electoral success, if not policy success in ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The withdrawal of Democratic activists changed the character of the antiwar movement by undermining broad coalitions in the movement and encouraging the formation of smaller, more radical coalitions. While the election of Barad; Mama had been heralded as a victory for the antiwar movement, Obama's election, in fact, thwarted the ability of the movement to achieve critical mass.

DT Article
ID PROTEST; MOBILIZATION; DYNAMICS; OPPORTUNITIES; REPRESSION; VIOLENCE;

AB Many have noted that protesters sometimes expand political opportunities for later protests, but there has been little analysis of how this occurs. The problem can be addressed by analyzing opportunity/threat spirals, which involve positive feedback among: actions by challengers (bold protests and the formation of alliances between challenger groups); opportunity-increasing actions by authorities and elites (elite divisions and support, procedural reforms, substantive concessions, and police inaction); and threat-increasing actions by authorities and elites (new grievance production and excessive repression). Interactions among these eight mechanisms are demonstrated in two cases of social movement growth, the U. S. women's suffrage movement of the 1910s and the German anti-immigration movement of the early 1990s. The cases show similar positive feedback processes despite many other differences, a finding which suggests that the specified interactions may operate in a wide range of social movements in democratic countries.

TI CRITICAL MECHANISMS FOR CRITICAL MASSES: EXPLORING VARIATION IN
   OPPOSITION TO LOW-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE SITE PROPOSALS
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Between 1986 and 1993, local activists in the U.S. organized more than 900 collective acts of public opposition to low-level radioactive waste site proposals across twenty-one counties. Yet, the number of such acts varied significantly across the counties. Both waste-siting professionals and social movement scholars have sought to identify, factors of mobilization to explain such variation. An analysis of these cases reveals that a focus limited to pre-existing factors of mobilization whether the demographic and economic factors favored by siting professionals, or the mobilization and political opportunity structures of the "classic social movement agenda"-badly misjudges mobilization. A paired comparison of two counties that differed dramatically in the number of acts of collective opposition mustered over the course of the siting process demonstrates the importance of social mechanisms that shape just how a community interacts with its political resources. The key differences between the two counties lie in the setting, sequence, and in the combination of the following social mechanisms: social appropriation, identify shift, and the attribution of threat and opportunity. To understand the assertion of local political power in an implementation process such as siting efforts, we need to understand not only the political resources available in a community context, but also the way in which human relationships shape the perception and application of that context.

ID SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; ASIAN-AMERICAN; IDENTITY
AB The Dynamics of Contention program emphasizes the role of external authorities as key to the certification of social movement actors. Its examples highlight the power of authorities to legitimate and affect the flow of resources to challengers. We focus on the continual work done by a social movement organization to be certified by multiple sources as the legitimate representative of its respective group or constituency, through an iterative and dynamic process. Using a comparative case study of two long-lived civil rights organizations in the United States, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Japanese American Citizens League, we argue that social movement organizations must gain certification from multiple certifiers, including those whom they claim to represent, government authorities, and the media. Certification from one authority may undermine its likelihood from another, and therefore an organization must negotiate these tensions as it works toward its larger goals.

ID MECHANISMS
AB Ten years from the publication of Dynamics of Contention, written with Charles Tilly, the editors of Mobilization have asked us to identify, work that reflects on the perspectives presented in that book. Dynamics of Contention attempted too many things: accounts of contention in Western and non-Western societies; consideration of a variety of forms of contention: a critique of the too-narrow focus on western reformist movements in social movement research; a call for a mechanism-and-process approach. For this symposium, we asked our colleagues to focus primarily on that final goal because we see it as the one making the most progress in this area since the publication of DOC. We dedicate this symposium to the memory and the example of Charles Tilly.

TI TERRITORIALITY AND MOBILIZATION: THE CIVIL RIGHTS CAMPAIGN IN NORTHERN
   IRELAND
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; SPACE; PROTEST; PLACE; DYNAMICS
AB This article assesses how the concept of territoriality can expand our understanding of the relationship between space and political mobilization. While the spatial aspects of social movement mobilization have received increased attention over the last decade, the specifically territorial aspects of mobilization remain undertheorized. This article elaborates on Sack's (1986) characterization of territoriality as a means to exert power by delimiting area. We analyze territoriality's role in the civil rights campaign in Northern Ireland through the late 1960s. The empirical analysis indicates that significant campaign power was rooted in the territorial boundaries and contexts that were deployed in the course of mobilization. Our intent in introducing the concept of territoriality is threefold: first, to help explain how mobilization is interwoven, through agency, with local context; second, to emphasize the utility of spatial concepts in the social movement literature; and third, to broaden the comparative range of case studies in the field of collective action by considering societies where boundaries are actively contested (weakly "naturalized"). We conclude with a discussion of how the concept of territoriality enhances a new reading of our empirical case and an analysis of the study's theoretical implications for our understanding of the relationship between mobilization and boundaries.

ID SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; ONLINE; ORGANIZATIONS; GLOBALIZATION; MOBILIZATION
AB Researchers studying Internet activism have disagreed over the extent to which Internet usage alters the processes driving collective action, and therefore also over the utility of existing social movement theory. We argue that some of this disagreement owes to scholars studying different kinds of Internet activism. Therefore, we introduce a typology of Internet activism, which shows that markedly different findings are associated with different types of Internet activism and that some types of Internet activism have been studied far more frequently than others. As a consequence, we ask an empirical question: is this skew in the selection of cases, and hence apparent trends in findings, a reflection of the empirical frequency of different types of Internet activism? Troublingly, using unique data from random samples of websites discussing 20 different issue areas commonly associated with social movements, we find a mismatch between trends in research cases studied and empirical frequency.

TI CO-OPTING SOCIAL TIES: HOW THE TAIWANESE PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY
   NEUTRALIZED ENVIRONMENTAL OPPOSITION
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID POLLUTION DISPUTES; POLITICS
AB This article seeks to understand how social ties can be manipulated by industrial producers in such a way that local opposition to pollution is neutralized. Social movement researchers argue that mobilization cannot proceed without pre-existing social ties, and further reflection suggests the nature of social ties is tremendously consequential. Clientelist ties are characterized by mass dependence and cooperation as beneficiaries expect favors from above. Thus, when clientelist leaders are politically excluded, a strong community-based protest is likely to take place under their leadership. However, if clientelist leaders are incorporated to share the benefits of industrial development, the result is likely to be community acquiescence even though popular grievances are endemic. This paper analyzes Taiwan's environmental politics since the late-1980s by focusing on how material compensations incorporated the previously excluded politicians. Elites thus played the role of redistributors and brokers, rather than protest leaders, and consequently, popular discontent over pollution was contained.

TI REPRESSING PROTEST: THREAT AND WEAKNESS IN THE EUROPEAN CONTEXT,
   1975-1989
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; MOVEMENT
AB Research on state repression of protest focuses on two key factors: threat and weakness. States repress protest events when they threaten state authorities and social norms (threat), when they lack organizational strength and political voice (weakness), or when they do both. I test these competing explanations in the context of Western European protests from 1975 to 1989. This analysis goes beyond previous research by exploring the effect of threat and weakness in multiple domestic contexts. The findings suggest that threat is the most powerful explanation of repression, whereas weakness only occasionally predicts repression and depends on country-specific contexts. The importance of the findings lie in their ability to emphasize (1) the universality of situational threat to police "on-the-ground" over theories that view a calculating state "up-above," and (2) the seemingly unified perception (in advanced democracies) of protest as an increasingly legitimate form of political participation that does not beget repression.

DT Article
ID SOCIAL DISCIPLINARY MODEL; NEWSPAPER COVERAGE; MEDIA COVERAGE;
   UNITED-STATES; REPRESSION; WASHINGTON; EVENTS; BIAS
AB Scholars have argued that since the 1960s, protest policing in Western democracies has moved toward emphasizing cooperative relationships with challenging groups. This evolution is referred to as the negotiated management model of protest control. Much of the literature that informs this perspective is based on either analyses of a limited subset of demonstrations or from national-level observation. Few studies have examined whether negotiated management practices hold at city levels. This research examines city-level protest policing using 1,152 demonstrations occurring between 1998 and 2004 in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver, Canada. Bayesian logistic regression models are estimated using arrests as the response variable. The main findings suggest that only protestor premobilization and the police use of force are uniformly related to arrests; that there is considerable variation across cities; and that the larger pattern of results is not consistent with negotiated management practices.

ID FRAMING PROCESSES; ABORTION DEBATE; MOVEMENTS; IDENTITY;

AB Social movements are arenas where individuals can voice concerns about politics, culture, and social change. Movements work to create frames and collective identities that resonate with the public and bind participants together. However, movement participants are not always completely free to cultivate and adopt frames and identities. The emergence of countermovements, in particular, can fundamentally affect these tactics. However, we find that frame and identity resonance can also be influenced by other factors and conditions. We explore these issues based on participant observation and interviews with activists at two ongoing anti-Iraq war protests and one ongoing pro-invasion protest, both of which occurred over a three-month period in early 2003. We find that local context, movement-countermovement dynamics, the ability to assuage oppositional challenges, and intra-movement unity and cooperation shape overall movement trajectories and success.

AB Editors Note: In 2007, The Center for the Study of Social Movements at the University of Notre Dame began sponsorship of an annual award named for its first recipient, John McCarthy. The John D. McCarthy Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Scholarship of Social Movements and Collective Action has subsequently been presented to Verta Taylor (2008), Mayer Zald (2009), and Doug McAdam (2010). As part of each year's award ceremony, the McCarthy Award winner gives a public lecture that reflects on her or his past contributions to the field of social movement research, while also looking forward to prom-ising lines of future inquiry. The publication in Mobilization of these lectures highlights both the important role recipients have played in shaping the field of social movement research, as well as their unique perspectives on where the field is headed. To this end each award winner has generously collaborated with Mobilization in the publication of an article based on the original McCarthy Award lecture. We are pleased to share Mayer N. Zald's contribution in this issue. McCarthy Award lectures from other recipients will appear in future issues as they become available to us.

AB How do women's rights activists mobilize in nondemocratic and culturally conservative contexts? Why do some women's movements succeed in securing the policy outcomes they seek while others fail to realize their objectives? Comparing two recent cases of feminist activism in the Middle East/North Africa region the Moroccan and Iranian campaigns for family law reform the article demonstrates the way that political opportunity structures shape the strategic options available to activists and influence movement frames. While a political opening is conducive to movement growth and success, including cooperation for legal and policy reform (Morocco), the closing of political space compels extrainstitutional feminist contention and transnational links (Iran). In examining the structure of political opportunity in addition to strategic choices, the paper addresses the interplay of structure and agency in mobilization processes and finds that-to paraphrase Marx-women and men make history, but not under conditions of their own choosing.

AB This analysis of the diffusion of racial rioting in the United States applies recently developed extensions of event history analysis to the spread of rioting from 1969 to 1971. Contrary to early analyses of riot diffusion, the results demonstrate that diffusion is a critical force behind the pattern of rioting. The analysis identifies several types of diffusion in the riot cycle, demonstrating that contagious influence from riots decays over tune, is mitigated by geographic distance, and is conditional on riot severity. Methodologically, the analysis produces extensions of prior event-history diffusion models that facilitate their use with collective violence and protest data.

ID COLLECTIVE-ACTION; ATTITUDES; BEHAVIOR; PARTICIPATION; DETERMINANTS;

AB We examine the extent to which personality traits and variables based on the theory of collective action (i.e., incentives) can explain protest participation. We use the Big Five personality traits, measured by a list of bipolar adjectives: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Incentives are political discontent and perceived personal influence, perceived obligation to protest and social incentives (i.e., integration in protest encouraging social networks). We hypothesize that personality traits have an effect on incentives and, together with incentives, on protest behavior. We test our hypotheses with a two-wave panel study, conducted in Leipzig (East Germany), where a total of 438 pet-sons were interviewed in 1993 and 1996. Major findings are that personality traits have only weak effects on protest, compared to the variables of the theory of collective action, and that personality traits have various effects on the independent variables (i.e., the incentives) of the theory of collective action.

AB Using individual-level data of protest participants in nine different protest demonstrations in Belgium, this article compares activists using the Internet and activists not using the Internet as an information channel about an upcoming demonstration. We find that "online" and "offline" activists differ significantly in terms of sociodemographic and political backgrounds, formal network and organizational embeddedness, and, to some extent, motivational aspects. The findings suggest that using digital communication channels likely extends and narrows the mobilizing potential to a public of experienced, organizationally embedded activists. The Internet is principally used by "superactivists" who are experienced and highly educated, and, who simultaneously combine multiple engagements. The article then discusses these results in light of two focal problems: that the Internet reinforces participation inequalities, and that the Internet might prove insufficient for sustained collective action participation and the maintenance of future social movement organizations.

AB Framing is widely recognized as an effective tool for resource mobilization, and much attention has been devoted to understanding the use of frames to mobilize participants. Less attention has been devoted to the use of frames to solicit wealth v donors despite knowledge that resource mobilization often includes this task as well. In this article, the case of the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) is used to analyze framing designed to elicit financial support from wealthy constituents. A frame analysis of the UNCF's mobilizing efforts between 1944 and 1954 is performed using qualitative data and methods. Findings indicate that soliciting support from wealthy constituents requires framing movement activity as though it will not lead to widespread change, even if logic or history suggest otherwise.

TI MOBILIZING EMOTIONS TO ELECT WOMEN: THE SYMBOLIC MEANING OF MINNESOTA'S
   FIRST WOMAN SUPREME COURT JUSTICE
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID GENDER; IDENTITY; AGENDA
AB Rosalie Wahl's appointment to the Minnesota Supreme Court and her subsequent election reveals how emotions make events historical, how they signal symbolic meanings, and how they mobilize social movements. The treatment of political women in the 1970s engendered the emotions that Wahl's appointment and campaign surfaced Relegating women party activists to the role of chore doers rather than decision makers humiliated them. Homemakers felt discarded and downwardly mobile after divorce. Exclusion and discrimination stung women lawyers. Feminism surfaced the powerful emotions of anger, exhilaration, solidarity, and hope that women would break down barriers. By deconstructing the rhetorical arguments of Wahl's speeches, interviewing participants in the campaigns, reading the letters that Minnesotans sent to Wahl, and examining my own emotional reactions, I uncover the emotional dimensions of these events. Understanding what catalyzed intense emotional identifications and what this historical event symbolized to participants facilitates theorizing gender as a social process and understanding why other women first to hold public office or first women candidacies generally do not become historical events.

AB In this article, we consider some of the ways in which the literature on political consumerism distinguishes this type of activism from social movements of the past. We then use three old and three recent U.S. examples of mobilization focused on food to highlight variations across cases-old and new-in how consumption-based identities are politicized and in how these movements are organized. We recommend using these variations in analytical properties, rather than broadly defined temporal periods, as the starting point for sorting and comparing cases of political consumerism.

   AGAINST TRANSGENIC MAIZE IN MEXICO
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE; MOVEMENTS; POLITICS; COMMUNITIES; BOUNDARIES; ECOLOGY
AB This article introduces the term "epistemic boomerang" to describe a distinctive pattern of activism in which activists, frustrated by exclusion from national politics, attempt to mobilize expert advice in support of social goals. Using expertise as leverage can be a desirable option for activists when political authorities favor technocratic decision making. Epistemic boomerang formation is possible when expert organizations encourage citizen participation in agenda setting and spaces are made for encounters between experts and activists. These processes are evident in the contentious politics of genetically engineered maize in Mexico. In this case, maize producers and community activists mobilized to confront an expert advisory group assembled by the tri-national Commission for Environmental Cooperation. As a result, the values and perspectives of many of the protesters were conveyed in the expert report and recommendations. This article examines the political outcomes of this epistemic boomerang and considers its implications for the study of social movements.

   ZAPATISTAS IN LOS ANGELES
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID COLLECTIVE ACTION; MOVEMENT; ORGANIZATION; COMMUNITY; IDENTITY
AB While examining the radical potential of 'free spaces" small-scale, grassroots sites for social movements-researchers neglect the daily activities underlying their continued existence. Based on participant observation at Zapatista community centers in Los Angeles, this article argues that everyday routines are important for the persistence of free spaces. Participants spent the majority of their time involved in routines. These were repetitive tasks for maintaining the organization; their focus was practical and immediate, as opposed to theoretical; and the rituals of participatory democracy structured them. At rare times, members reflected on their work, initiating abstract political talk to inspire and unify thernselves in response to tedium from mundane activity or a crisis. Yet, reflection also distracted from applied work and even proliferated organizational schism. This suggests that free spaces retain stability by balancing both routine and reflection.

AB The bureaucratization of many social movements has generated controversy among scholars and activists alike. While there is considerable evidence that formalized social movement organizations (SMOs) tend to be successful, critics maintain that such actors invariably shift resources away from protest, reducing their disruptive potential. The current research seeks to reorient this debate by introducing the concept of threat as an integral,. but overlooked. dimension of protest. Specifically, I hypothesize that the costs associated with collective action will motivate formalized SMOs to leverage the threat of protest to achieve new gains. The empirical case is made using data from a sample of labor unions and their strike activity from 1990-2001, a period of growing acrimony between organized labor and firms that is particularly well suited for analyzing threat. The findings highlight the role of threat in movement challenges and how it interacts with the broader environment within which the SMO is embedded.

   MOBILIZATION; CULTURE; FRAME
AB This article examines the uses and effects of grotesque imagery in the antislavery and antiabortion movements and considers implications for theories of movement framing and mobilization. Grotesque images can produce strong emotions that may increase the resonance of movement frames and provide physiological "evidence" of immorality. Such images may also produce confusion and ambiguity that deeply engages readers or viewers and potentially breaks frames. But grotesque images can also be counterproductive for activists. They can cause readers or viewers to turn away in disgust, and their use can taint activists as prurient, irrational, uncivil, or manipulative. Finally, the effects of grotesque images are likely to vary across audiences, social contexts, and the skill of the activists that deploy them.

AB The theory of protest cycles has informed us that the external political environment and the internal competition among social movement organizations are distinct elements leading to the emergence, development, and decline of popular protest. This theory, however, has not been examined systematically. I conduct an event-history analysis to test and refine the theory of protest cycles using a well-known new social movement event dataset. While proposing a general way of operationalizing the core concepts in social movement studies, I show that political opportunity only matters during the initial phase of social movement mobilization, rather than throughout the movement's lifespan. What explains declining frequencies of protest occurrence during the demobilization phase is the joint effect of two internal factors: the institutionalization of social movements and the growing violence during protests.

AB The article theorizes and presents normalization as a movement-level strategy available to social movements dealing with an internal threat. By defining themselves against an internal threat's abnormality through a process of normalization, social movement organizations assert how they and the movement operate within socially and politically respectable parameters. Drawing on ethnographic, interview, and newspaper data, I show how mainstream South African lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) movement organizations deployed normalization to marginalize and expel an internal threat, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance, between 1998 and 2006.

AB This article examines collective identities as both a resource and constraint in framing processes of social mobilization through a case study of Panama's Kuna Indians, one of Latin America's most effectively organized indigenous peoples. It highlights tensions between movement nurturance of distinct indigenous identity as intrinsically valuable and to a degree counterhegemonic and instrumental use of an environmental frame to advance indigenous land claims. This article also explores shifts in dominant discourse and institutional practices that provide both opportunities for identity-based movements as well as risks. One way identity groups address tensions between appropriation of externally generated frames for instrumental goals and the nurturing of distinct collective identities is to manage multiple frames aimed at distinct audiences with distinct content.

SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; COLLECTIVE MEMORY; OPPORTUNITY
AB This article explores the significance of reflexivity as a cultural process in social movements. It examines the roles that gender and memory played in mobilizing women in the antimilitaty movement in Vieques, Puerto Rico, between 1999-2003. In particular, the analysis focuses on the articulations and actions undertaken by the Alianza de Mujeres Viequenses. While some emerging research stresses the novelty of women's participation in the latest effort to remove the U.S. Navy from this island, none have operationalized the event in a theoretical context and highlighted key nuances. This article engages literatures on the significance of gender in the mobilization process as well as the cultural nature of remembrance and its significance in the meaning-making process for collective actors. It does so through an examination of the mobilization of women in the antimilitary movement. Furthermore it argues for the acknowledgement of reflexivity in the examination of claims articulation for mobilization.

   MOBILIZATION; POLICY; CONSEQUENCES; DETERMINANTS; SUPPORT; SUCCESS
AB This article examines how incremental outcomes-gains and losses that stop short of decisive victory defeat-influence movement organizations, particularly, in terms of the public financial support they enjoy and the amount of money they subsequently allocate to programmatic expenses. Drawing on data from the US anti-death penalty movement, I find that small gains and losses significantly influence support and spending patterns. Movement success initially increases both financial contributions and programmatic spending, but over time. decreases both. Moreover the particular effect is mediated by the type of venue in which the outcome takes place: formal institutions produce different rates of increase and decline than informal ones. These differences have important implications for movement organizations' choice of venue in which they make their claims while emphasizing the importance of considering incremental outcomes not only as end products of contention, but as inputs that are consequential for future movement development.

AB This article investigates the empirical evidence for the statement that the impact of social movement organizations (SMOs) and interest groups on policy making is dependent on public opinion and the political system. A meta-analysis of articles published in eleven sociology and political science journals from 1990 to 2007 is used to lest two hypotheses: 1) when public opinion is taken into account, SMOs and interest groups have no direct effect on policy; 2) the existence of a democratic regime is a necessary precondition for finding any policy impact of SMOs and interest groups. Results show that laking account of public opinion does not generally make any difference in the finding of direct effect. . However, the role of public opinion varies across the measures of organizational resources and activity. I also find that a democratic regime is not a necessary precondition for the impact of SMOs and interest groups on public policy, but show that a direct effect of interest organizations is less likely to be found in the studies that take account of political regime.

AB This article aims to contribute to the debates on how cultural context influences mobilization outcomes through a comparative analysis of two Israeli social movement organizations that supported conscientious objectors and draft resisters during the second Palestinian Intifada. This analysis has two objectives. The first is to show how cultural and institutional conditions of Israeli militarism influenced both the discourses and the tactics of resistance of the movement organizations. The second is to demonstrate that different tactics of the movement organizations had a differential impact on the Israeli public and the Israeli political system. It is argued that both the culturally and institutionally; embedded gender inequality, within Israeli society has determined the choice of the available strategies for the movement organizations, which has in turn influenced the relative success of their campaigns.

AB This article reanalyzes the data of a previous study on the policy impact of antinuclear, ecology, and peace movements in three countries with the aim of replicating its findings. Our goal is to see whether using a different analytical technique will yield similar results. The previous study, used a regression approach to time-series analysis. Here, the use qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to analyze the previous study's data. Specifically, the test the two main hypotheses based on the joint-effect model of social movement outcomes: (1) that the policy impact of social movements is conditioned by the presence of powerful allies within the institutional arenas. by, the presence of a favorable public opinion. and/or by both factors simultaneously; and (2) that social movements are more likely, to have policy impacts when they address issues and policy, domains of low saliency. In addition, we compare the policy, impact of social movements across countries. Our analysis confirms to a large extent the findings of the earlier time-series analysis, namely, the strong explanatory power of the joint-effect model of social movement outcomes and the varying impact of different movements on public policy.

AB The impacts of social movements on public policies have been studied extensively, yet yield mixed results. Some results point to a strong impact of social movements, while others conclude that they do not possess any observable, leverage on public policies. These mixed results may be linked to utilization of different methodological approaches. However, few studies have considered the possibility that movements may in fact prevent policy change. In this study, we argue that for high-profile policies such as nuclear energy, a low-key social mobilization is in some instances necessary for the occurrence of major policy changes. We further hypothesize that highly mobilized social movements may dampen the chance of major policy changes instead of promoting them. We briefly present the general model and the data before proceeding to the bounded exploratory analysis. This analysis raises questions about the role played by antinuclear movements in their quest for a major policy change. A theoretical explanation is then presented in an attempt to contribute to the clarification of the movement-policy debate.

TI DO-IT-YOURSELF MOBILIZATION: PUNK AND SOCIAL MOVEMENTS
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID ROCK; WOMEN
AB The intersection between music and social movements is a fertile area of research. We present three case studies taken from punk the Rock Against Racism campaign in Britain during the late 1970s, the American hardcore scene of the 1980s, and the riot grrrl feminism of the early 1990s-as instances where music and subculture have not simply figured as symbolic forms of resistance and identity formation but also as a means of organizing protest, raising consciousness, and creating change. The central mechanism that has allowed punk subcultures to achieve high levels of mobilization has been the do-it-yourself ethic, which demands that punks take matters of cultural production into their own hands by making music, fanzines, and record labels, creating a network of venues for live music performance, as well as creating other forms of micromedia that are commercially independent of the corporate culture industry. We use these case studies to both draw attention to neglected areas of empirical research and as a means to intervene in theoretical debates that have tended to polarize social movement studies between paradigms that emphasize structural phenomena and those that emphasize cultural factors.

AB To explain varying levels of collective action by social movement organizations in the United States operating during the height of the 1960s protest cycle, this article examines social movement sector-level dynamics alongside indicators of resources and political opportunities. Drawing on hypotheses from neoinstitutional, organizational ecology, and embeddedness perspectives, the paper emphasizes the importance of understanding the sector-level dynamics of legitimacy, competition, and embeddedness when explaining levels of collective action. Results show strong support for neoinstitutional, organizational ecology, and embeddedness theories, but more mixed support for arguments about how political opportunities and resources affect levels of collective action by social movement organizations.

AB This article builds a theoretical framework that highlights the role of social movements in industry emergence and growth. Using insights from the literature on social movement outcomes and industry creation, the article shows that the environmental movement has shaped the development of the wind energy industry at both the national and subnational levels. During the past two decades, wind power has transformed from a small, "alternative" energy industry into a multibillion-dollar global industry that produces electricity for millions of people. Quantitative analysis shows that the wind energy industry grows the fastest in countries and regions that have not only a high density of environmental groups but also good wind potential or a favorable political opportunity structure. Case studies deepen this picture by examining how environmental organizations contribute to the development of the wind energy industry.

AB Social movement researchers propose different ways to incorporate meaning into structural approaches, notably into political opportunity structure (POS) theory. In this article we further develop one of the recent attempts to do so: discursive opportunity structure theory (DOS) as proposed by Koopmans and Olzak. We pay particular attention to the role of feelings. Although the DOS model correctly points toward the discursive construction of political opportunities, it does not explain why certain events are experienced as opportunities by potential activists. We propose the reason is two-fold: 1) discourse contains feeling rules and 2) discourse resonance implies the shaping of protest subjectivity. Our model is applied to a specific case: protests against aircraft noise annoyance in two countries. We show that feeling annoyed by aircraft sound is shaped by specific policy discourses, which then prepares the ground for protests.

AB This article takes issue with the "weak state" and "hollowing out of the state" theses, which appear in recent literatures dealing with globalization. In order to analyze the nation state's. contention with various actors concerning human rights and other issues, a conceptual distinction is suggested between state autonomy and capacity-defined as the state's ability to rationally posit objectives and to realize them-and state sovereignty, defined as the symbolic and discursive basis of the state's legitimate rule. Based on the constructivist perspective, which emphasizes the intersubjective character of the social world, and the role of knowledge and interpretation in any social conflict, we present three cases of objections to Israel's construction of a separation barrier on occupied Palestinian territories. These three cases exemplify the importance of the conceptual distinction between autonomy-capacity and sovereignty as two dimensions of domination and reveal a situation in which political struggles that effectively reduce state autonomy may actually increase its sovereignty.

AB This study asks under what domestic conditions environmental groups in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany will overcome the collective action, resource, and ideological impediments to cooperative activity. A political opportunity structure (POS) approach is employed which looks at the relationship between elite alliances and domestic cleavages and the choice to engage in domestic as well as transnational cooperation. Using data gathered through content analysis over a nearly twenty-five year period, I find that changes in domestic opportunities influence the choice of environmental groups to engage in cooperative activities. An open POS is found to depress both domestic and transnational cooperation, while a closed POS increases cooperative activities.

AB The celebrated tale of this "Midnight Ride " notwithstanding, Paul Revere's role in the events leading up to the American Revolution remains rather obscure. Joseph Warren, known as the man who sent Revere on that ride, presents a similar quandary. What was the nature of the roles they played in the mobilization process? I address the question from a social structural perspective, reassessing the evidence and reconsidering the key concept of brokerage. The analysis show that these men were bridges par excellence, spanning the various social chasms and connecting disparate organizational elements of the movement, thus bringing together "men of all orders" to forge an emerging movement.

DT Article
ID POLITICAL MEDIATION; WORLD MARCH; PROTEST; COALITIONS; RESOURCES;
   POLICY; SCALE
AB Social movement campaigns help create the networks and collective identities needed to build social movement communities, which in turn support subsequent collective campaigns. This article examines the interactions between movement communities and campaigns using the case of the 2000 World March of Women in Montreal. We find that movement community resources and networks, mobilized by leaders in stable movement organizations and institutions, support campaigns. Centralization, diversity, and size of movement communities affect campaign mobilization. Movement campaigns alter movement communities by creating bonds that form the basis for subsequent campaigns and by keeping movement communities politicized. Prior campaigns generate public consciousness, put issues on the public agenda, create new frames and discourse, forge connections to new constituents, and leave behing new networks, coalition organizations, leaders, and activists. Our research contributes to an understanding of the connections between the submerged networks of social movement communities and the contentious politics of movement campaigns.

   PROTEST; WOMENS; FRAMES; CHURCH; STATE
AB Drawing from social movement and organization theories, data from an in-depth comparative analysis of three faith-based community development organizations (FBCDOs) in the United States are examined as a form of cooperative collective action. The diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational frames produced by each organisation, and the role these frames play in developing and maintaining relationships with the state, are detailed. These collective action frames (1) link sectarian religious values to broad community development goals, and (2) do not fundamentally challenge the prevailing economic and political systems. Empirically, the findings clarify important issues and dynamics related to emerging movements, the modern welfare state, and church-state relations by specifying how values, beliefs, and structural location shape the actions of FBCDOs engaged in state-sponsored religious social service provision. Theoretically, it demonstrates the utility of more precise analytical distinctions between types of collective action and suggests new directions for research on movements for change.

TI EXTERNAL PRESSURE AND LOCAL MOBILIZATION: TRANSNATIONAL ACTIVISM AND THE
   EMERGENCE OF THE CHINESE LABOR MOVEMENT
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS
AB This article elucidates connections between two strategies of transnational social movements-external pressure and local mobilization-and two potential outcomes paternalism and psychological empowerment. Application of this, theoretical framework to the nascent Chinese labor movement indicates that an overreliance on an external-pressure approach results in paternalism, thereby precluding psychological empowerment for aggrieved actors and potentially inhibiting movement growth. Conversely, strategies that relegate external support to a secondary role and privilege local mobilization are more likely to result in psychological empowerment. In this study, I argue that psychological empowerment is a prerequisite for the emergence of a worker-based movement in China. Many studies of cooperation between movement actors from the global North and South have seen this relationship as essentially unproblematic. I begin to problematize the inherent power inequalities between the two sets of actors and will theorize the implications for movement emergence in Southern countries.

AB Although episodes of contentions politics in undemocratic regimes constitute the lions share of contentious political events worldwide. the theorizing of political opportunity structures is based largely, on contentious episodes in democratic/liberal political settings. This anomaly hampers recent attempts to redefine the boundaries among episodes of contention across time and place. Employing the case of the first Plaestinian Intifada (1987-1992). I critically examine three examine three theoretical aspects of political opportunity structures (POS).- (1) how the link between POS, strateg, and tactics is forged; (2) how different levels of POS interact: and (3) the ability of multiactor movements to cope with the shifting nature of POS. I conclude by briefly illustrating the relevance of my findings to other structurally similar cases. and discuss the implications of my analysis for further sensitization of the Dynamics of Contention research program.

SP Amer Sociol Assoc
ID PRIVATE-SECTOR; DECLINE
AB After more than a decade of analyzing efforts to revitalize the U.S. labor movement, many have concluded that organized labor must become a movement again. Nevertheless, most analyses remain based on the traditional view that labor powere is derived solely from the portion of the labor market that is unionized. This fact is illustrated by the continued use of union density as the primary means of assessing labor movement strength. this article examines this "density bias" and ways that it constraints analyses of labor revitalization-obscuring alternative sources of movement power, excluding community based labor organizations, and oversimplifying assessments of organizing processes. The article highlights the need for a critical assessment of conventional wisdom in labor studies and argues that treating labor as a social movement may generate new research questions and move theorizing in promising new directions.

AB Most scholars of social movements agree that since the 1960s protest policing in the United States has decreased in severity. Yet this characterization runs counter to sociolegal arguments that virtually all forms of state social control have become more forceful. We maintain that both of these arguments obfuscate what is really of essence to policing of protest: the character of the protest event and the level of threat posed to police. We examine U. S. protest policing over the 1960-1990 period and show that while it is generally true that aggressive policing is less likely following the 1960s, threatening protests are always policed aggressively, regardless of the period. The findings suggest that general claims about the increasing or decreasing severity of policing over time are less useful than are arguments about the character of the protest event and the level of threat posed to police officers.

AB In this article, we address the question of how diffusion mechanisms predict the level of violence among soccer fans. We embed possible causes of violent fan behavior in a theoretical framework of diffusion, as social movement scholars deploy it to study other instances of collective violence. Four possible diffusion explanations are examined: social status of transmitters (both other fan-sides as well as soccer players), status similarity of adopter and transmitter, direct ties as captured by geographical distance, and indirect ties as measured by media coverage. These explanations are tested for the occurrence of violence around soccer matches in the Netherlands during the period 2001-2005. We employ a pooled complementary log-log analysis of fourteen teams over two hundred match weeks and control for repression, city size, and several match characteristics. We find considerable evidence for three of the four proposed explanations and demonstrate that aggressive play on the pitch, hooliganism by fan-sides with similar status, and media coverage are significant explanatory factors for the evolution of fan violence.

AB Research on movement political success has grown measurably, yet few studies consider the role of framing in bringing about challenger victories. Existing investigations taking collective action framing into account typically consider only whether movement frames with broad cultural resonance are more convincing to policymakers. This study examines other qualities of movement frames to uncover argumentative forms that allow activists to persuade lawmakers to alter policy. I examine efforts by organized U.S. women in the early twentieth century to persuade state legislators to broaden jury laws to seat women jurors. Quantitative analyses reveal that jury frames that (a) define the problem of excluding women as serious and broad in scope, (b) provide a clear rationale for supporting activist demands, and (c) offer concrete evidence to support the frame's claim are likelier to convince lawmakers. The status of the frame's articulators and the quantity of movement framing are not predictors of movement success.

AB This article examines the ways that collective identity influences the mobilizing work activists perform in a wide variety of progressive activities in Hartford, Connecticut, as reported in open-ended life history interviews. Using a collective identity typology based on ideology, organization, and biography, the analysis demonstrates the variety of ways in which these different "group allegiances" affect how activists raise consciousness, choose strategies and goals, pursue allies, and build coalitions. These myriad differences in mobilizing by activists with different collective identities within the same movement sector speak to the flexibility of social movement structures and to the importance of activist identity in maneuvering within those structures.

AB Using a cross-sectional time-series event-count model, this study analyzes the effects of local, national, and international variables on pro-Zapatista protests across the 111 localities (municipios) of Chiapas over a ten-year period (1994-2003). Protests were more likely to occur in localities with previous protest activity, a closed political system, and a larger presence of the military. Local and national electoral openings, as well as a larger local and national presence of the Zapatistas' presumed political ally, the Partido de la Revolucion Democratica (PRD), had a negative relationship with protest activity. Specific openings to the Zapatistas also worked as protest depressants. International attention did not show any significant effect on Zapatista protest activity. However, these institutional and specific openings were only ephemeral opportunities in that they did not translate into substantive concessions for the movement. They appear to have decreased the strength of the Zapatista protest cycle, while the international attention to the movement did not show any significant effect on it.

AB While early studies of participant mobilization in contentious politics stress the roles of organizations and networks in mobilization, more recent scholarship emphasizes the importance of place. This article treats organization-based mobilization and place-based mobilization as two mechanisms of participant mobilization and tries to find a way to understand the relationships between them. By examining different styles of student mobilization during the 1999 anti-U.S. protests at three Beijing universities, each with similarly built environments and spatial student routines, this article shows that the built environment played a crucial role in student mobilizations where there was less organizational involvement, and a small role when mobilization processes were more organized. In short, less-organized protests may be compelled to rely on placed-based mobilization tactics.

TI SPACES OF INTENTIONALITY: RACE, CLASS, AND HORIZONTALITY AT THE UNITED
   STATES SOCIAL FORUM
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The World Social Forum process has sought to provide an "open space" for diverse movements to exchange ideas, interact, and coordinate as they build another world. Despite this inclusive impulse, many of the forums have been disproportionately white and middle class. Through an ethnographic account of the 2007 United States Social Forum (USSF) in Atlanta, I examine one high-profile attempt to overcome this lack of diversity by establishing what I refer to as an "intentional" space. I argue that the intentional strategy pursued by USSF organizers achieved a high level of diversity in racial and class terms, but de-emphasized the role of the forum as a "contact zone" for translation, sharing, and exchange among diverse movement sectors. However, given the strong desire to overcome past exclusions among participants, the privileging of intentionality over openness and horizontality was widely viewed as legitimate, which has important implications for democratic practice.

ID COLLECTIVE IDENTITY; ETHNOGRAPHY; DEMOCRACY; POLITICS; CULTURE
AB The first United States Social Forum (USSF) took place in Atlanta in the summer of 2007. To report and analyze this intense five-day event, we employ an innovative method, which we refer to as "distributed ethnography." This involves a large, multidisciplinary team of researchers who all contribute to our observational data and participate collaboratively in the writing and editing process. We consider how the U. S. political context shaped the character of this particular iteration of the World Social Forum. In particular, we analyze how the USSF reflected several ongoing debates within the larger World Social Forum (WSF) process: (1) whether the WSF should remain an open space or a political actor; (2) how to be more inclusive of the poorest and most marginalized social groups; (3) whether to pursue radical or reformist agenda; and (4) whether to target local, national, or global political arenas. A significant outcome of the USSF is that it challenged existing notions of open space by engaging in deliberate efforts to bring the most marginalized groups to the table. The U. S. political culture helped to mute overtly ideological debates, as many workshops and discussions instead focused on concrete projects, initiatives, and reforms. At the same time, many USSF organizers and presenters articulated a radical vision of revolutionary social change led by those who are most directly oppressed by prevailing systems of social, economic, and racial domination. Despite the many factors inhibiting radical politics in the United States, the USSF marks an important step in the process of bringing the larger struggle against global neoliberalism into U. S. politics. It also shapes the WSF process itself.

AB The World Social Forum (WSF) and European Social Forum (ESF) processes represent a new platform for experimenting with multilingual practices of "deliberative talk." Activists come together in meetings that take place at the regional level between these larger social forum events. The "European Social Forum Preparatory Assemblies" (EPA), for instance, allow activists in the ESF process to hold regular meetings in a multilingual format using simultaneous translation. I will explore how activists in such transnational meetings deal with the tension between time consuming, multilingual discussion processes and efficiency. Comparing meetings of European and South African groups within the umbrella of the ESF and WSF processes, I found the "politics of language" to be a very fragile aspect of the practice of deliberative discussion. However, some groups have developed innovative tactics or have made creative use of cognitive resources to tackle the challenge of linguistic exclusion.

Consistent with world systems theory, we find that labor activists from the semiperiphery protested most frequently whie their counterparts from the periphery protested the least frequently. We also found that union members and labor activists from the periphery were significantly more supportive of reforming ( rather than abolishing and replacing) capitalism and international financial and trade institutions compared to their counterparts from other zones, although this finding disappears after local ( Kenyan) participants are excluded from the analysis. Finally, we find that representatives of organized labor from the semiperiphery were the least supportive of proposals for creating a democratic world government, while those from the core were the most supportive of global/international strategies for social change.

At each meeting, social forum attendees were generally less satisfied with the major institutions shaping the global economy and more active within social movements compared to the general population. Nevertheless, there was considerable variation in the political views and activities of attendees across these three venues, attesting to the importance of the forum location and local organizers for shaping participant composition. Differences between respondents from the host city and country and international respondents varied across venues, but local respondents were generally less radical, had fewer affiliations to political organizations, and protested less compared to other respondents.

It analyzes channels of exchanges between political parties, trade unions, pressure groups, nongovernmental organizotions (NGOs), organizations of the unemployed, as well as main policy actors and institutions. The main aim is to compare cross-nationally the extent to which similar sets of actors in different national fields build different patterns of exchange, and the dynamic relationship between these patterns of exchange and unemployment-related mobilization. Networks variation is matched against cross-national differences of collective action. Networks, it is argued, are an additional and necessary dimension of any investigation of collective action.

ID MOVEMENT
AB The "return" of poor people movements encourages reflection on the impact of changes in the social structure, the availability of organizational resources, and political and discursive opportunities for collective action. Based on a quantitative and qualitative claim analysis in six European countries, this article maps unemployment-related protest actions in three areas: (a) long-term unemployment; (b) massive dismissals; and (c) unemployment and labor policies within more general cycles of protest. The article discusses the actors, the forms and claims of the protests, and the social and political opportunities for their development. Protests on Unemployment tend to assume some similar forms, each oriented to stress the "absolute injustice" of the position of the unemployed. The framing of the issues of both labor changes and the evolution of the labor market restates the importance of social dynamics for political protest. Unions as well as other social movements and political actors play an important role in the protest against unemployment.

ID PROTEST; MOVEMENT; 1930S
AB This article follows a revised political opportunity approach to argue that mobilization of underprivileged groups is constrained by the political opportunity structures provided by the institutional context of the country in which they act. Contrary to traditional opportunity theories, it is suggested that their mobilization also depends on a set of opportunities specific to the political or issue field most directly addressed by their claims. I propose to look for these specific opportunities in the institutional approaches to unemployment. I further maintain that such opportunities stem largely from the ways in which a given political or issue field is collectively defined I apply a theoretical framework stressing both general and specific opportunities as well as the discursive context of claim making to original data on claim making in the unemployment political field in six European countries for the 1995-2002 period. The findings provide some support for the proposed theoretical framework, but also point to its shortcomings, especially in the lack of attention to economics factors.

TI WHEN THE UNEMPLOYED CHALLENGE THE EUROPEAN UNION: THE EUROPEAN MARCHES
   AS EXTERNALIZATION OF PROTEST
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This article examines the conditions for the emergence of a most unexpected movement. It traces how a small number of leaders, in the context Of weak support of the institutional representative frameworks, gave collective and political meaning to the dissatisfaction of the unemployed. Sticking to the European agenda, the movement, by means of the "march" format, was able to make itself visible to the media and more generally, to public opinion, both of which it then used as resources. I identify the strategic orientations that ran through the movement and whose articulation led to a new mode of the Europeanization of action, which I call "the externalization of protest." The article concludes by identifying some of the effects induced by the marches, and suggests the incapacity of the mobilization to survive to the global justice movement, although it was one of its first expressions.

TI TRANSCENDING MARGINALIZATION: THE MOBILIZATION OF THE UNEMPLOYED IN
   FRANCE, GERMANY, AND ITALY IN A COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID PROTEST
AB Mobilization by the unemployed has traditionally been considered a highly improbable phenomenon. However, recent observations challenge such a supposition. Our article compares protest waves in France, Germany, and Italy, where the unemployed successfully organized themselves and acted on their own behavior several months. We argue that mobilization of the unemployed- although it empirically proved to be a possibility-remains very fragile, particularly depending on beneficial "windows of opportunities." Our analysis is above all interested in deciphering macrostructural conditions and opportunity structures, arguing that the unemployed benefited front external developments causing changes in potential mobilizing resources, and brought about new allies and political entrepreneurs. At the same time, however, these opportunity structures were actively, exploited and, at the same time, their opening was fostered by the mobilization itself.

AB Analyses of selection bias in the coverage of protest events in Minsk, Belarus between 1990 and 1995 are presented. The rapid changes characterizing Minsk during its transition from Communism made it an ideal location for investigating the stability of the patterns of selection bias. Police records of 817 protest events were used to create a protest event dataset, and Minsk's four daily newspapers were read for the entire period in order to establish estimates of event coverage. Results show that large events, events with strong sponsors and, in two of the four newspapers, events accompanied by arrests are each more likely to receive coverage. These effects remain stable through phases of the transition for the combined coverage in any of the papers. The selection factors of event size and event sponsorship also display stability across media source, although the impact of arrests is not always consequential.

TI Validity and media-derived protest event data: Examining relative
   coverage tendencies in Mexican news media
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID LOCAL NEWSPAPER COVERAGE; CONFLICT
AB This essay engages the debate over the validity of media-derived protest data through an assessment of event coverage for three Mexico news sources. With a focus on "relative"-as opposed to "absolute"-coverage tendencies, it is argued that certain coverage tendencies in news sources can be identified and, in turn, incorporated as controls into more substantive analyses of protest phenomena. Specifically, this analysis finds that that, for the Mexico media, claims that coverage is representative of all protest events is dubious with respect to the overall population of specific events and to the geographic distribution of events. At the same time, it is shown that tendencies driven by regional biases, chronology, event size, event targets, and event issues can be exposed and identified through a simple comparison of the principal media source to one or more others.

AB In the 1990s and early 2000s, government privatization and austerity programs served as the cornerstone of free market reforms implemented throughout the developing world. The selling off of government utilities, resources, and services laid the groundwork for a highly contested battleground in the global South over social and economic distribution. This study examines the sequencing of campaigns against neoliberal reforms in Central America. Two successful movement campaigns against privatization in El Salvador and Costa Rica followed failed collective attempts to impede similar economic reforms. The policy outcomes against neoliberal measures are explained by the path-dependent nature of the organizing templates activists chose to employ and the breadth of social movement unionism achieved. The article offers insights into similar battles currently waged in the third world over the pace of economic globalization and the conditions in which oppositional movements are likely to succeed or fail.

DT Article
ID POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY; MOVEMENTS; STATES; END
AB This study, builds upon and extends prior literature on political participation by exami-ning individual-level and city-level determinants of Latinos' protest participation in the U.S. Multilevel models were used on a sample of 2,810 Latinos of Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban descent. Individual factors such as age, education, income, religiosity, and organizational involvement are found to impact participation in expected directions. Results also point to a significant role for contextual factors in shaping the probability of participation. On the one hand, protest participation is more likely in cities with a greater presence of Latino organizations, which points to the importance of mobilizing agents. On the other hand, protest participation is less likely in cities with relatively large Latino populations and where more Latinos hold elected office, suggesting protest is deemed less desirable or necessary when more formal channels of political participation are viable. Together these results are useful for understanding the factors that motivate Latino protest at the individual and con-textual levels, which present opportunities for further understanding their participation in unconventional politics.

SO MOBILIZATION
LA English

ID EDUCATION; BOURDIEU; IDENTITY; FIELDS
AB This article draws on Bourdieu's sociological approach to expand social movement theory, while offering sociologically robust direction for movements themselves. In Bourdieu's theory, practical action is produced by the habitus. Generated in its social field, habitus conveys cultural encoding yet in a nondeterministic manner. In a Bourdieusian approach, environmental social movement organizations become the social space in which a logic of practice consistent with movement goals can be "caught" through the informal or incidental learning that occurs as a result of participation with social movement organizations. I compare Bourdiett's theory of practice with Eyerman and Jamison's view of social movements as cognitive praxis. I argue that the environmental movement would be better served by conceptualizing itself as working to create an ecological habitus which would underpin ecological lifestyles and environmental social change.

TI In the name of the Prophet? Danish Muslim mobilization during the
   Muhammad caricatures controversy
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The twelve Muhammad caricatures published in September 2005 led to unforeseen Muslim mobilization and claim making in Denmark. Several academics, public intellectuals, and politicians have explained this by referring to the caricatures as the culmination of an existing Islamophobic climate in Denmark. The caricatures were "the straw that broke the camel's back" anti Danish Muslims, thus, were bound to react to the imposed grievances. Such socio-psychological arguments require further investigation as to (1) how this unforeseen large and sustained Muslim mobilization in Denmark came about, and (2) why the "Confrontation line" of action was chosen by Danish Muslims on this occasion? In doing so, the article argues for a need to de-essentialize, de-exceptionalize and dynamisize the study of Muslim mobilization.

TI Repression and crime control: Why social movement scholars should pay

AB The disciplinary insurgency that created the academic field of social movement studies distinguished dissent from crime. This dichotomy has led the field to ignore the relation between the repression of dissent and the control of "ordinary" crime. There was massive repression in the wake of the Black riots of the 1960s that did not abate when the riots abated. The acceleration of the mass incarceration of African Americans in the United States after 1980 suggests the possibility that crime control and especially the drug war have had the consequence of repressing dissent among the poor. Social movement scholars have failed to recognize these trends as repression because of the theoretical turn that built too strong a conceptual wall between crime and dissent. Revisiting this dichotomy is essential for understanding repression today.

AB Can an elite-sponsored outcome be a social movement outcome? In Kreil v. Germany, the European Court of Justice issued a judgment hailed as a feminist victory, censuring Germany's exclusion of women from the military. But the women's movement did not sponsor the case; it was an organizational achievement for the nascent court that extended its jurisdiction to public security while preserving its legitimacy among potentially non-cooperative member states. With this case, I reassess movement-elite relations in the context of past protests that forged discursive resources. The women's movement did play an important role in this case: the court relied on discursive resources from past feminist activism to legitimize its decision and frame it as a matter of women's rights, drawing attention away from its uncertain jurisdiction. I present a model of "borrowing" from movements, a relationship distinct from alliances and cooptation, to show how elite-sponsored outcomes can still be movement outcomes.

AB What cultural and structural factors allow conflict in a social movement organization to persist over long periods of time? Using data gleaned from interviews, archival materials, newspaper articles and online sources, I examine the Sierra Club's conflict over immigration policy, an issue which has persisted for decades without clear resolution. I argue that ideology accounts for some activists' position on club policy, while others based their stance on strategic concerns, which were linked in part to forces external to the club. At the same time, the democratic structure of the Sierra Club has allowed factions to continue working towards their own agendas. This case reveals a more complicated connection between ideology and strategy than previous studies have indicated and illuminates how intense conflict may not necessarily be associated with dramatic outcomes.

TI Situating movements historically: May 1968, alain touraine, and new
   social movement theory
SO MOBILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Recent literature on social movements has called for a renewal of theory so that it engages more directly with the social and historical dynamics in which movements emerge and crystallize. Too often, some critics argue, movements are treated as static or reified phenomena that are disconnected from their links to space and time. I examine new social movement theory from an historical perspective that emphasizes its connections with concrete social dynamics at a given point in time. Unlike alternative approaches, new social movement (NSM) theory and in particular the work of Alain Touraine, was forged out of a specific episode of social conflict-the May 1968 revolt in France-and was deeply informed by the experience of this conflict. This theory provides a dynamic and relational model in which social and historical processes are treated as major determinants of collective action within society. Infact, what explains the success of NSM theory and its enduring influence over time, is that it reaches beyond an analysis of social movements to provide an overarching theory of society at a given historical juncture. The article suggests that NSM theory provides a fruitful perspective for scholars searching for an approach that take history into account.

ID MOVEMENTS
AB The article studies the May 68 demonstrations in four cities: Paris,. Lyon, Saint-Etienne and Roanne, and relies mainly on the archives of the French police. Its main aim is to show that what happened in French streets in May and June 1968 largely depended on the dynamics of the interactions between different contending groups-students, workers, police, radical-right groups, and government supporters-and that an important part of these interactions was determined by the significance these groups gave to the various settings where the events took place, and by the ownership they claimed to have over them. The article relies on the recent interest of social movement scholars for the spatial location of contention, but also on Goffman's theory of the territory of self to analyze together the symbolic and the strategic dimensions of the May 68 repertoire of contention.

TI Forming coalitions: A network-theoretic approach to the contemporary

ID SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS
AB This article investigates how multiple movement structures interplayed with each other in collective action/social movements in South Korea over the period, 2003-2004. By employing advanced methods in social network analysis, meta-network representation, analysis of structural association, and analysis of structural sequence, this article aims to complement existing paradigms of social movement research. Specifically, it investigates the forces that led environmental movement organizations (EMOs) to form coalitions based on the structured relations between governing personnel, movement ideologies and coalitions. The findings suggest that sharing similar ideologies facilitated coalition formation among EMOs and the role of coordination between governing personnel across the EMOs was marginal. Furthermore, a few leading EMOs were central actors across different movement structures, though religiously affiliated Green Christ and Catholic Environmental Network were also active in coalition formation. The framework and the findings further scholarship on collective action among organizations of varying forms (e.g., firms, unions) in the environ-mental movement sector and in other societal settings as well.
