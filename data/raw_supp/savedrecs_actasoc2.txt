AB This is a study of young people's conceptions of illegal drug use as dangerous and/or pleasurable and an analysis of the relationship between attitudes to drugs, drinking, friends' reported drug use and own experience with drug use and drinking. The article applies a mixed methods approach using both survey data and focus group interviews. The main statistical method is Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), which constructs a social space of young people's attitudes to drugs and drug experiences relationally. We identify four interrelated positions on illegal drug use among 17 to 19-year-old Danes: the anti-drug position, usually held by youths who do not use illegal drugs and do not have drug-using friends; the ambivalent position, occupied by non-users who report that they have drug-using friends; the transitory position, held by cannabis users, some of whom express positive attitudes to 'hard' illegal drugs; and, finally, the pro-drug position, characteristic of drug users with low risk perceptions and high pleasure-orientation. We use the focus group interviews to demonstrate how youths occupying these differing positions argue for and against drugs and which risks and pleasures they associate with drug use.

AB Individual behaviors, such as loss-coping and "grief work" are affected in organizational contexts. In everything pertaining to coping with trauma in general, and loss more particularly, the individual is "trapped" within a political psychology that enforces the habitus and expectations of institutional dominance on the ostensibly intimate and private response. Regimes have perceived bereavement over battlefield deaths as a form of social capital that can be mobilized to enhance national loyalty and political support. Employing both existential/hermeneutic and institutional analysis, this study examines three diachronic models of bereavement - hegemonic, political and civil - and their political ramifications in the Israeli context. Drawing on changing parental conceptual orientations towards fallen sons and their role as cultural and ideological agents in public sphere, the article traces the movement of bereavement from its capture by the hegemonic state institutions to its creations under the domination of others institutions: political and civic and ultimate use in critiquing the political and military echelon. The article indicates the powerful impact of the social institutional-organizational context on the intimate-psychological context of coping with loss, by illustrating this phenomenon in the Israeli society.

AB Building on the notion of the 'social nature' of money, this article investigates how dual-earner couples in Germany, Spain, Sweden and the US handle money in their everyday lives. We analysed in-depth, open-ended interviews conducted with 45 couples in these four countries to determine whether they define money as 'joint' or 'separate' and to investigate the consequences such definitions have for couple relationships. The concept of the convertibility of money helped us to spell out these consequences in detail. In addition, we explore whether the meaning of 'joint' or 'separate' money might relate to institutionalized cultural frameworks embodied in welfare policies that vary between countries. Couples in Spain and in Sweden seem to practise a low degree of convertibility of money into other resources, but they do so for different reasons: in Spain, money tends to be considered 'joint money' from the outset, whereas in Sweden it is often kept 'separate' and outside the relationship. In contrast, in the US and Germany, money, while often classified as 'joint' by the couples, is more likely to be seen as each partner's individual contribution to the relationship. Thus it can be, and often is, converted into resources such as domestic work or recognition.

AB This article explores the social distribution of involvement in highbrow culture in light of three issues being discussed in cultural sociology. One is that highbrow cultural orientation is an indicator of cultural capital or of social status. A second, the 'meltdown scenario', suggests that not only the popularity of highbrow activities, but also their distinctiveness, has decreased among younger cohorts in comparison to older cohorts. A third deals with the 'feminization' of highbrow culture. These issues are empirically addressed in contemporary Finland using nationally representative survey data. Highbrow culture is measured in three dimensions of cultural practices - knowledge, taste and participation - covering four different fields: music, literature, cinema and the visual arts. The results support all three arguments: First, education and occupational class are important social determinants of involvement in highbrow culture in Finland. Second, younger age cohorts show less interest in highbrow culture than do older Finns. Third, women tend to be more involved in highbrow culture than men. The results indicate considerable stability across the measures of highbrow culture and cultural fields. Social determinants of knowledge and cinema, however, are different from those in other dimensions and fields.

AB Restoring species to their former range has become a major goal in official environmental policy. Under strict protection, the expansion of a new wolf population has been taking place on the Scandinavian Peninsula since the late 1980s, leading to much controvery in rural areas. Most research on conflicts concerning wolves has taken antagonistic attitudes as a point of departure. In this article we question such an approach. Taking social representations as our framework for analysis, our aim has been to find out how wolves are perceived and whether an analysis of such cultural meanings could contribute to a better understanding of the conflicts accompanying wolf recovery. Focus group interviews in two areas in Eastern Norway suggest that it is not antagonistic interpretations of the carnivores' nature that fuel the conflicts over wolves, but different views as to whether they belong in the areas where they are now found. Yet, at the same time, it is against the undisputed background of the wolf's perceived character that the negotiations over their belonging to Norwegian nature make sense. We so argue that the theory of social representations provides a comprehensive framework for studying the complex relationship between consensus and diverging opinions, and between culturally embedded representations and conflict, that appears to lie at the heart of such issues.

ID TRANSITION; POLITICS
AB Under what cultural conditions can the relics of symbolically polluted time re-emerge as its purified signifiers and culturally successful icons within new circumstances? What does it mean when people articulate 'nostalgic' commitments to social reality they have themselves recently jettisoned? Drawing on the ideas of the iconic turn and American cultural sociology, the article offers a new framework for understanding post-communist nostalgia. Specifically, it provides a comparative reinterpretation of the phenomenon of so-called Ostalgie as manifest in the streetscapes of Berlin and its counterpart in Warsaw. One of the key arguments holds that 'nostalgic' icons are successful because they play the cultural role of mnemonic bridges to rather than tokens of longing for the failed communist past. In this capacity they forge a communal sense of continuity in the liquid times of systemic transformation. As such, the article contributes to broader debates about meanings of material objects and urban space in relation to collective memory destabilized by liminal temporality.

While previous work on unemployment scarring has predominantly focused on re-employment wages as well as subsequent employment rates, this study examines how past unemployment affects non-pecuniary job attributes of re-employed workers. Using the European Community Household Panel, it undertakes a comparative analysis of the consequences of past unemployment in four European countries with very different institutional contexts: Austria, Denmark, Spain and the UK. The results present clear evidence of job quality scars and point to notable cross-country differences in the extent and pattern of scarring.

AB In this article, I analyse the consequences of unemployment on the re-entry occupational status and subsequent occupational status growth of different educational groups in the first years of employment in the UK. I argue that phases of unemployment mean different things for different educational groups. The sequential nature of job offers causes job searchers either to accept a job offer immediately or to wait for the next offer. Higher aspirations and higher levels of savings mean that high-educated people are more likely to wait until they are offered a job that improves their occupational position. In the case of low-educated workers, however, waiting for a better job offer might not be the best strategy, because they might never get one; in addition, the low level of unemployment benefits from previous salaries, the regime of sanctions linked to the right to receive unemployment benefits and low household incomes push them into employment. I use growth curve models and parameterize in one model both the pre-unemployment and the post-unemployment phases. Based on British Household Panel Survey ( BHPS) data, the results confirm my argumentation: high-educated people gain status while low-educated entrants lose status upon re-entering the labour market after unemployment.

AB Medical priority-setting has been discussed heatedly in Sweden since the 1990s. While criteria such as medical need, solidarity and cost-effectiveness were established long ago, they failed to give clear directives to decision-makers on how to apportion priority. The notion of individual responsibility for one's health was suggested as one solution out of the impasse. According to the responsibility principle, anyone who fails to live up to the norms of a healthy lifestyle can legitimately be given lower priority. Although the principle is gaining support, its effectiveness is being hampered by structural problems. We have analysed official reports and pertinent fora of the Swedish debate on priority-setting from the period 1990-2009 and have examined the responsibility principle using a Luhmannian framework. Unlike common criticism emphasizing difficulties of assessing whether individuals can actually be held accountable for their lifestyle, we found that the responsibility principle fails in its current form because it unifies two incompatible logics deeply rooted in the functionally differentiated structure of society: those of medical reasoning (connecting health condition with lifestyle) and political expediency (attributing responsibility). We conclude that future policy-making cannot simply overlook this conflict, but has to acknowledge its presence and constructively utilize its potential.

AB Twenty years have passed since the Hillsborough tragedy, which eventually resulted in the deaths of 96 supporters of Liverpool Football Club. This article draws upon the cultural trauma theory developed by Piotr Sztompka to provide a sociological understanding of the localized experience of public grief that has followed the tragic occurrence. The authors analyse the different stages of cultural traumatization, with a particular focus on the conflicting emic and etic representations of the Hillsborough tragedy with regard to opposite constructions of 'truth' and the attribution of blame. It is shown that while Hillsborough may be a matter of recollection and regret for the wider, (inter) national, public, the cultural trauma of Hillsborough for the people of 'Liverpool' is far from over.

AB In this article, I analyse a theoretical multi-level model of entrepreneurship in which institutional variables associated with different variants of capitalism and individual level differences in resources can potentially explain whether and why new firms are created. Our model answers calls for more research on why countries differ in terms of 'entrepreneurial spirit' and whether and how individual level predictors of start-up activity vary across countries and institutional contexts. In addressing these issues, I 'merge' insights from 'entrepreneurship studies' in management and the varieties of capitalism tradition in economic sociology. The empirical research draws on a database containing information about 188,835 individuals from 21 countries.

LA English
DT Article
DE Burma; campaigns; globalization; public debate; solidarity
AB This article compares Burma-related solidarity campaigns in Denmark in 1988 and 2007 to demonstrate an increasing transnational complexity of domestic solidarity campaigns and, more generally, domestic public spheres. Differences between 1988 and 2007 are identified in four areas or 'complexities': Informational complexity, organizational complexity, composition complexity and analytical complexity. Informational complexity is identified in the increasing variation in information sources between the two years. Organizational complexity is evidenced by the fact that an organizational infrastructure related specifically to Burma emerged in the period between 1988 and 2007. Composition complexity is expressed in the greater intensity of the 2007 campaign, as well as in the broader set of actors involved in it. In particular, corporations emerged as central players in the period. Analytical complexity is found in the way prognostic frames in the 2007 case consistently placed the issue of Burma in a larger world political context.

AB Despite decades of research on the association between socio-economic status (SES) and crime, its strength and nature remain contested. Using a unique dataset combining data from several administrative registers with a nationally representative sample of 28,485 19 to 30-year-old Finnish citizens, we examine SES differences in violent offences, property offences and driving while intoxicated. We use multiple measures of SES in order to see what it is in SES that increases crime risk. We also test the strain accumulation hypothesis to find out whether presence of multiple strains increases crime risk disproportionately. The results indicate that, in addition to male gender, SES is strongly associated with all three types of crime, and the predictors are largely similar for all the offence types in question. Long-term unemployment and having only a basic education, in particular, were the most robust predictors of offending. These associations held after controlling for previous criminal involvement as well as other social characteristics, whereas the effect of low income on crime was primarily attributable to prior involvement in crime. Overall, the results imply that there are both causation and selection mechanisms at play. No interactive effect was found for strain accumulation.

DT Article
DE Bauman; hope; interregnum; political sociology; pessimism; socialism;

AB This article focuses on Bauman's contribution to political sociology and proposes that, in spite of his apparently pessimistic critique of contemporary society, his work has much to offer the 'new positivity' within the social sciences. Drawing upon his writings on socialism and utopia, as well as his frequently normative 'liquid sociology' period, the article pursues the idea that Bauman's work offers a vital compass - understood as a particular way of orientating ourselves towards the present - such that we are better able to navigate the complexities and uncertainties of the current interregnum. Given the various social, economic, political and environmental crises that have come to characterize the first decade of the twenty-first century, the article concludes by suggesting that Bauman's compass provides a useful sense of direction for rising to the task of rethinking global societies in order to meet these shared challenges to human social life.

AB This article assesses the potential contribution of neo-institutional world polity theory to the study of global conflict dynamics. Prevalent conflict theories explain the emergence and resolution of conflicts by resorting to actors' mutually incompatible preferences and differential access to economic, social or symbolic sources of power. World polity theory challenges fundamental assumptions of such theories by conceptualizing action as highly scripted and actors as culturally constituted. By focusing on the cultural rules of modern actorhood, world polity theory accounts for the emergence of new motives of conflict no less than for the diffusion of 'rational' methods of conflict resolution. It concludes by arguing that theoretical explication and empirical analysis of the hitherto neglected conflictive dimensions of the world polity approach is a fruitful agenda for conflict research and neo-institutional scholars alike.

   recruitment; vocabularies of motive
ID ACCOUNTS; RECORD
AB The use of criminal records in the recruitment process has increased dramatically in Sweden over the past decade. The article analyses the various vocabularies of motive used to account for the practice in order to examine how it is justified and legitimized by those resorting to it: employers, representatives of employers' organizations and union representatives in the business sector who endorse criminal background checks as part of the employee screening processes. The dominant vocabulary as articulated in the interviews appealed to notions of corporate risk and security. However, it was contested by an alternative vocabulary focusing on an individual's right to privacy and reintegration, and by a third vocabulary centring on the notion of trust. To stress their character as moral actors, employers who checked criminal records avoided relying on the risk vocabulary alone. They tended in addition to incorporate elements of the rights vocabulary to justify their actions against the values embodied in it. Even though the results of the study suggest parallels between the increase in the use of criminal background checks and a shift toward a 'control society' or a 'society of exclusion', they also show that legal rights of the individual still inform the justificatory discourses at least in Sweden.

AB In this article, we study how young people with an immigrant background (first and second generation), which attend schools that can be considered more 'Swedish' experience the transition from a 'multicultural district' to the city centre. The empirical study was conducted in a large Swedish city, where the students attended two different programmes. In the analysis, we take a narrative approach, with student movements in time and space analysed in relation to concepts such as territorial stigmatization, alienation, bodily practices and identity positions. Findings show that the students often compare the city school with other schools - the city school described as a 'white' school, the other schools as 'immigrant schools'. The different schools are clearly placed on a status hierarchy, with the city school at the top and other schools somewhere below. The students have confronted and succeeded in transgressing social and cultural boundaries. However, the feeling of otherness that originates in housing conditions, experiences of exclusion and the everyday life of many immigrants is transposed, so to speak, to the school area and transformed into strategies for handling exclusion and otherness.

DE emotions; health policy; instrumental rationality; normative structures;

AB Compassion and hope are vital to individual and societal flourishing, not least through the solidarity and change that they facilitate. This article considers the importance of these two social phenomena for welfare institutions, and in particular for the hospice movement and the National Health Service in Britain. Compassion and hope are enacted due to the normative structures in which citizens are embedded. From here it is argued that a dialectical process exists whereby compassion and hope spur the creation of, and are embedded within, healthcare and hospice institutions. In turn, these institutions encourage and give rise to the practice of these emotions across society by virtue of making normative structures more visible. However, the role of these institutions as signifiers of compassion and hope is not straightforward. Tensions exist between the instrumentalism required to provide expansive healthcare access for all, and the communicative action through which hope and compassion are practised at the interpersonal level. More positive norms, such as compassion and hope, intersect with a range of other frameworks which may constrain or undermine their outworking across society. Future research and policy-making needs to acknowledge institutions' broader influence and value when appraising their role and effective management.

AB In this article, we study trends in employment by education and long-standing illness (LSI), and discuss whether the findings are compatible with business cycle fluctuations or postindustrial labour market developments. Our analyses are based on data on the working age population (aged 25-66 years) from the Norwegian Survey of Living Conditions (1980-2005). We find increasing differences in employment between those reporting LSI and those who do not, while gender differences are getting smaller. Interaction terms from logistic regression analyses between time and LSI, and time and education, indicate that people with lower education and those reporting LSI are more often found outside the labour market over time. While the 1980s recession did not have much impact on employment inequalities, the more severe 1990s recession coincided with widening employment inequalities by education and health. Periods of economic recovery did not mitigate these inequalities. The study concludes that health and educational inequalities in employment have been rising in Norway since 1980. As business cycle changes alone could not account for the development, elements of the postindustrial labour market are discussed and considered.

AB The education of children of immigrants is an important aspect of the integration of immigrant groups into receiving societies. This article focuses on the first transition in the Finnish education system. Two aspects are analysed: continuation versus dropping out and choice of upper secondary school type (general versus vocational). Results suggest that children of immigrants tend to have a higher probability of dropping out of education at this transition than the majority. However, this can largely be explained by prior school achievement and family resources. Controlling for these, only some first-generation groups are left disadvantaged. Second-generation students with very low prior school achievement or a father outside the labour force are also at an increased risk of dropping out. These drop-outs may be seen as discouraged students. The picture is more positive for choice of general school. After similar controls, most children of immigrants have a higher probability of choosing general school than the majority. The difference is greatest for the non-European second generation and for students with below-average prior school achievement. Together with the results for drop-out, this points to an avoidance of vocational schools by some ethnic minority groups.

AB The article describes the complexity of researching staff-prisoner relationships ethnographically, and scrutinizes how the complexity linked to the research process may inform an analysis of relationships in prison. I argue that ethnographic research comes with uncertainty and insecurity, because the participation of the researcher, as an informed and involved outsider, requires shifting social engagements in relation to which the researcher constantly has to guard and disguise information and positioning to observe confidentiality and build trust. I demonstrate how the experience of the researcher mirrors and resembles the insecurity and uncertainty that accompanies prison relationships that I characterize as relative. I explain why it is therefore difficult to distinguish between insider and outsider, front and back, public and private, trustful and cautious and friend and enemy, and how this results in a constant guarding and disguising of information and positioning among officers and prisoners. Finally, I argue that while social relativity provides uncertainty and multiple loyalties that contribute to the low trust environment of the prison, it also makes possible the compromises, discretion and flexibility required to ensure a tolerable humane flow of everyday life by providing for management of both personal and social agendas.

AB Paradoxically, the contemporary network approach has so far declined to produce a theoretically elaborate account of social relationships - the very core entities that underpin both its ontological outlook and methodological stance. This article addresses certain substantive aspects of social connectivity that are either theoretically underdeveloped or largely neglected in this approach. These include: (1) the essential and defining properties of relationships; (2) their inherent dynamics; (3) the impact of larger socio-cultural contexts in which specific ties and networks emerge; and, finally, (4) various grounds of connectivity and general types of social ties. The article concludes with a discussion of how the prevailing formalistic conception of social tie poses an obstacle to the materialization of the great potentials of the network approach and how a substantive re-conceptualization of its bedrock entity may open up the possibility of turning this mode of inquiry into a truly relational approach.

AB Using a sociological theory of rational argumentation as its point of departure, this article discusses the 'best interests of the child' as a guiding principle when decisions are made. Application of this principle has been criticized for weakening the legal protection of children and parents and resulting in arbitrary and subjective decisions. The criteria for rational decision-making are outlined and three cases of enforced adoption are analysed in an effort to understand how the Norwegian highest appellate court comes to a decision in the best interests of the child. The findings show that two of the three decisions do not meet the standards of rational argumentation, suggesting that decisions are instead based on the judges' subjective preferences. This finding is problematic from a democratic point of view and indicates that decisions and interventions are neither rational nor legitimate.

ID SUBJECT
AB This article examines the promotion of private life insurance in Finland between 1945 and 1990. Although a fully-fledged social insurance system was established during this period, private insurance did not become obsolete. How were people encouraged to engage in voluntary forms of insurance in the new situation? We study the ways in which insurance was marketed by justifying its usefulness in relation to the 'goods' that were presumed common to all potential customers. The key theoretical frameworks are given by the literature on 'governmentality' and by Boltanski and Thevenot's model of justifications. The first of these is used in our discussion of the general role of insurance as a multifaceted social technology, whereas we use the model of justifications in analysing the core themes of promotion. The promotional materials reveal that private life insurance is not an attractive economic tool for potential customers without reference to at least some moral justifications. However, these justifications are heterogeneous and open to change. In addition, the question of which particular moral emphasis seems most relevant, and when, is related to socio-economic transformations. Especially important are the changes in the interplay between social and private forms of organizing insurance responsibility.

AB Developments in biotechnology have sparked off a number of social controversies during the past decades and it has been common to understand public debate as a necessary prerequisite for the ability to deal with these controversies. This is particularly true in the case of Denmark, where public debate has been taking place for more than 25 years; the article uses the Danish example to argue that controversies about biotechnology intersect with fundamental political discussions about order and control in today's knowledge society. Inspired by cultural theory and the work of Mary Douglas, it is proposed that arguments about biotechnology are justified by reference to particular articulations of social order. Her four notions of social order are identified in the analysis of a sample of arguments from four major Danish newspapers. On the basis of this typology, the article examines the broad discursive consensus in favour of public debate and participatory exercises regarding the social responses to biotechnology. Simultaneously, however, it points to inherent tensions in expectations towards public debate and its role in the creation of solutions to controversies over science and technology.

AB Autonomy, or the extent to which employees can control their own work, is a central theme in debates on organizational flexibility and labour market stratification. Predictions of upskilling and autonomy, for manual workers too, have been a striking component in visions of post-Fordism and post-industrialism. The two main comparative labour market theories - the varieties of capitalism school and the power resources approach - suggest that both the level and the distribution of autonomy vary across production contexts, either because of national differences in skill requirements or because of the varying strength of organized labour. The objective of the article, based on the 2004 European Social Survey, is to test these two hypotheses by examining national variation regarding mean levels and class differences in autonomy among 21 countries. The main conclusion is that both mean levels and class differences in autonomy have much more to do with the strength of organized labour than with the skill requirements of production. The analysis also questions a central element of the varieties of capitalism theory, namely the notion of national production strategies based on differences in skill specificity.

AB In this study, we examine factors assumed to have disposed students to radicalism in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The data are from a recent retrospective survey of 1,246 former University of Oslo students born between 1940 and 1950. The unprecedented number of radical respondents allows for analyses that could not be done in earlier studies, especially of the extreme left. The results reflect the preponderant influence of parents' political preferences. Variations in political orientation between different fields of study and between cohorts, with students born towards the end of the 1940s being more radical than students born earlier in the decade, suggest influence by peers, although this is hard to gauge. Urban upbringing is found to be significant, pointing to the possible importance of exposure to radical world-view carriers. Neither gender nor class has significant controlled predictive power. Since most students were men, and students were far more likely to protest than extramural youth, males dominated the protest movement. Students from the working class were more radical than middle-class students, but apparently this was due not to any independent effect of class but to differences in the world-view to which they were exposed at home, manifested in parents' political preferences.

AB In this article, we pose the question: To what extent does a lack of individual resources and of access to high quality resources in one's core social network explain why low-educated people are likely to experience economic vulnerability? Additionally, we explain cross-national differences in the risk that the low-educated run in terms of economic vulnerability. Multi-level models estimated for 22 countries of the European Social Survey show that a lack of labour market success and partner's resources explain why the low-educated are likely to suffer from economic vulnerability. Next, we find a number of determinants to explain why the low-educated are better off in some countries than in others, i.e. cross-national variation in access of the low-educated group to high quality social resources, beliefs about the productivity of the group as a whole, structural labour market conditions and welfare state arrangements. In so far as welfare states can influence the contexts in which their (low-educated) citizens live, to a great extent they can also reduce economic vulnerability among the low-educated.

AB Using data from Sweden and Norway on cohabitors aged 25 to 35, we examine the association between socio-economic resources, relationship quality and commitment and cohabitors' marriage intentions. The individualization process, i.e. the arguably growing importance of individual choice, leads us to assume that relationship assessments are more important predictors of marriage intentions than socio-economic variables. Nonetheless, multivariate results show that university education and having a partner whose education is higher than one's own increase the likelihood that cohabitors intend to marry. Likewise, being satisfied with and committed to the union is positively related to having marriage plans. Separate analyses for men and women reveal that whereas commitment is positively related to women's marriage intentions, men's marriage intentions are significantly more influenced by their own education, income, as well as the income of their partners. In this sense, one conclusion to be drawn is that both love and money are associated with cohabitors' intention to marry.

AB Studies have shown that women receive lower wage returns to attained occupational prestige than do men. In this article, I examine whether the gender difference in wage return for attained occupational prestige can be explained by men's and women's different family obligations, and whether gender differences in work characteristics, which are difficult to combine with family duties, account for some of the gender wage gap in returns for attained occupational prestige. If women's family obligations were a major cause of women's disadvantage, the negative interaction between women and occupational prestige with regard to wages would be larger for mothers and married/cohabiting women than for single women without children. Results show a gender wage gap between married/cohabiting men and women with children that increases with occupational prestige. However, the interaction between gender and prestige is insignificant among single women and men and among married/cohabiting respondents without children. Furthermore, when controlling for time-consuming work, the gender wage gap for married/cohabiting respondents with children according to occupational prestige narrows, especially in occupations with high prestige.

AB In this article we focus on the level of subjective well-being and its determinants among the unemployed as compared to those currently in paid labour. We subject three strongly contradictory theoretical approaches to an empirical test. The first is the traditional deprivation theory, which maintains that unemployment is a major psychological stressor. The second is the incentive theory, which claims that the level of well-being among the unemployed may be sufficiently high to discourage them from actively and effectively searching for a new job and re-entering the labour market. The third approach emphasizes the adverse effects of financial stress for subjective well-being during unemployment. We use the European Social Survey (ESS) data from 21 countries in our empirical analysis. We find no support for the incentive theory. The deprivation theory points in the right direction by stressing the psychological factors associated with unemployment but makes a notable omission by disregarding the financial strain which, according to our analysis, proves to be crucial for the well-being of the unemployed.

AB Given the institutional and financial opportunity to choose any school public or private/independent - in the city, how are we to understand students choosing to stay in their low-performing, high-poverty schools with bad reputations? Drawing on interviews with 53 students from two urban schools in Stockholm and Malmo, as well as on the secondary literature and theoretical perspectives on community discourse and the freedom of choice policy, I argue that we will never understand why students choose to stay if we consider only the values of the pedagogical commodities exchanged in the educational quasi-market. The analytical gaze ought to embrace sociological perspectives on the local community and schools, including individual strategies in relation to school choice and the power of relations, categorization and stigmatization. Thus, I conclude that neither deficiency in information, transportation costs and time nor some murky cultural-religious incentives are behind the decision to stay. The major incentive can be found in the ongoing negotiations between different aspects of community and school discourse that young people develop, whereby, among other things, the prospect of losing a network and the feeling of safety and becoming an outsider in exchange for gaining access to a 'Swedish' middle-class school is, for the time being, not deemed a fair deal.

AB This article draws from field research conducted from 1993 to 2003 examining the impact of political regimes and economic globalization on the development of salmon aquaculture in Norway, Chile and Ireland. Norway underwent salmon aquaculture industrialization under the auspices of social democracy, whereas Chile and Ireland did so through the influence of neo-liberalism. Social democracy imposes limits on the economic and geographical concentration of capital, whereas neo-liberalism facilitates the economic and geographical concentration of capital. This is because social democracy uses salmon aquaculture to foster the redistribution of benefits, whereas neo-liberalism uses salmon aquaculture to foster economic growth. Nevertheless, some evidence shows the strength of regional development interests in containing the full brunt of neo-liberalism in rural Ireland. The article concludes with suggestions for deepening the comparative political economy discussion of rural capitalism.

AB The article presents and discusses the sociology of philosophy as a theory-based empirically practised sociological subdivision that came to the fore in the 1980s. In the first part, the type of empirical material and the forms of data presentation that are available to the sociology of philosophy are discussed. In the second part, the focus is on two important attempts, those of Randall Collins and Pierre Bourdieu, to develop general sociological theories about the relationship between social being and thought. The main lesson to be drawn from them is that in normal circumstances philosophical thought cannot be reduced to socio-political conditions outside the attention space (Collins) or the philosophical field (Bourdieu). In the concluding part, we tentatively sketch a programme for a future sociology of philosophy. All in all, the sociology of philosophy is seen as an emerging new subdivision within sociology, the potential of which is far from exhausted with respect to theoretical development as well as empirical approaches.

AB Examining recent strategies to combat long-term homelessness, the article looks at two social policy reforms implemented in a Swedish municipality. The first of these involved dismantling of the existing hostel system and its replacement with the 'housing staircase' model. The second meant the end of the housing staircase model and the engagement of private for-profit companies in the municipal special-housing service provision. By incorporating the new actors within its homeless policy framework, however, the municipality has merely adjusted its approach to accommodate a practice already followed on the ground to legitimize an existing situation. The reforms resulted in revisions to official policy and organizational structures, while actual practices remained unaffected. As a result, little has changed in the situation of the long-term homeless. Regardless of the type of service supplier (municipal, for profit or non-profit), measures to counteract homelessness in Sweden have remained dependent on a general premise equating homelessness with addiction, mental illness and deviance more broadly. Alternatives based on access to regular housing are not even debated, despite the success such approaches have had elsewhere.

AB Utilizing register panel data (1992-2003), in this article we study long-term sickness absence among immigrants and ethnic Norwegians (n = 200,022). The data contain detailed information on socio-economic background, labour market participation and social insurance benefits for all individuals aged between 16 and 67 years residing in Norway. We present four main findings: (1) There is no difference in sickness absence between ethnic Norwegians and immigrants from the other Nordic countries, Western and Eastern Europe after controlling for demographic, socio-economic and labour market factors; (2) the sickness absence rates are higher among individuals from Asia (men and women) and Africa (men), and lower among men from North America and Oceania compared with ethnic Norwegians; (3) second-generation immigrants share the same level of sickness absence as ethnic Norwegians; (4) residence time has a curve-linear effect (reversed U-shape) on sickness absence for most immigrant groups. We discuss the findings in relation to the reason for emigrating, health risks related to immigration, social exclusion and norms towards sickness absence.

AB In this contribution we describe and explain the differences in popular poverty attributions that exist within and between 28 European countries. On the basis of the existing literature we distinguish five predictors: awareness of the existence of poverty, personal experience of disadvantage, personal values, sociodemographic background and structural and cultural country-level characteristics. Using data from the European Values Survey (EVS) 1999/2000, we assess for most of these predictors the extent to which they relate directly to people's partial ranking of popular poverty attributions. The results of rank-ordered logistic regression models show that differences in popular poverty explanations relate directly to whether one lives in a country with a Catholic tradition and a high level of poverty, their (subjective) experience of disadvantage and personal values. Furthermore, we find that the size of the various associations depends on people's particular choices of poverty explanations.

AB This is a study of the intergenerational occupational class mobility of cohorts born 1936-75 in Finland and of the role of the changes in educational attainment. The data are taken from the Finnish Census Panel, from which mobility tables for 5-year cohorts that have reached the age of 25 have been constructed at 7 time-points: 1970, 1975, 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000. The period change in social fluidity appears to be towards greater openness for both men and women. However, the cohort differences are more significant. Class origins and destinations are more strongly associated with the youngest cohorts than with the cohorts born in 1951-65, suggesting a strengthening of social inheritance. The period change can be explained by the changes in educational attainment. However, although the changes in the origin-education association play some role in reducing cohort differences, controlling education-related variation does not change them very much. The findings suggest that, in order to explain the cohort differences, it might be worthwhile considering institutional factors other than education.

AB The end of communism in Eastern Europe ushered in an era of markets and modernity. Post-communist capitalism has also wrought stratification with intensified upward and downward socio-economic mobility. Examining the case of Latvia, we offer an analysis of one of post-communist capitalism's most apparent effects: the creation of a broad and diverse mass of economically disadvantaged inhabitants. While numerous writers have framed their analyses in terms of the 'winners and losers' of change, most research has treated these categories as exclusive entities and has paid little attention to the sociological relationship between them or the diversity within them. This work elaborates the relationship between the economically disadvantaged and both post-communist capitalism and the upper socio-economic rungs of society. As well, we offer three ideal-typical categories for description and analysis of post-communism's economically disadvantaged masses.

   Recognition
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
DE anomie; Axel Honneth; critical theory; neo-liberalism; recognition;
   self-realization
AB On a descriptive level, the article points out that Western populations have experienced an increase in possibilities for self-realization, but also that the rise in options has led to a paradoxical increase in different forms of psychic distortion. On a more normative level, it has become clear that the neo-liberal idea of freedom, which seems to state that a free market will facilitate all forms of self-realization options, is incomplete. Application of the neo-liberal idea of freedom makes it clear in two ways that the recognition-graduation semantics are twisted in such a manner that individuals cannot cognitively make sense of what can and cannot be an object of recognition, and that intersubjective recognition relations are eroding to such an extent that commonly shared pathological development tendencies are in danger of being suppressed by the lacking ability to join in a collective will-formation. It seems that the neo-liberal idea of freedom is creating a cognitive discrepancy between a promise for more and more self-realization options through deregulation and the actual stable possibilities for individual self-realization. What is becoming evident is that no secure self-realization options are offered, but rather that the individual has to have options in order to gain recognition.

ID ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION; INERTIA; GROWTH; MORTALITY; ADOPTION;
   INDUSTRY; WOMENS; MODEL
AB To what extent can conventional organizational theories help us understand changes in local voluntary associations? Using unique data from all associations in a Norwegian county, the article explores hypotheses concerning how size and age affect change behaviour. The results show that high organizational age increases the probability of core change, but decreases the occurrence of peripheral change. The average age of the field in which the organization is active is negatively related to both types of change. The findings suggest that old voluntary organizations are more tenacious than for-profit actors; they choose to attempt change rather than disband if becoming obsolete or pressured by the environment. The degrees of freedom are greater in new, non-institutionalized fields than within fields with a long history. Size has a weakly positive effect on both change indicators. Stronger data and theory-building efforts are needed if we are to extend our knowledge of this under-researched, but immensely important, organization type.

   vagaries of scholarship; verification research; Weber thesis
AB Things are not always as they seem. A cursory examination of a table of statistics cited in the Weber thesis appears to reveal striking differences in the educational 'preferences' of Catholics and Protestants. Careful scrutiny, however, on a number of grounds, especially in light of the importance that Weber attaches to these statistics in the articulation of his thesis, reveals that not only are the statistics seriously compromised by errors and omissions, but they lead to an evolving state of confusion engendered by scholars who, while engaged in the concealment or ostensible correction of these flaws by often dubious means, have published changed and conflicting versions of Weber's statistics. By examining two recently published new English translations of the Weber thesis, this study resolves and clarifies some of the uncertainties surrounding the proper interpretation of these statistics within the context of Weber's theoretical argument and the socio-political climate in which they were produced. The reader is invited to explore how reverential bias in classical scholarship actually emerges.

ID E-SCIENCE
AB This article focuses on data-sharing - a central aspect of an ambitious e-Science programme recently embarked on in Sweden. Data-sharing has become a powerful and promising direction in e-Science in general, even though fraught with difficulties. Sweden has a unique position in relation to data-sharing: a world-unique set of social science and medical data collections, a well-established tradition of regulations concerning data protection, a widely used form of personal identification that allows integration of databases, and a population that generally trusts researchers and the Swedish state with personal data. The aim of this study was to find out how Swedish database owners/managers and database users - key actors in the Swedish e-Science enterprise - anticipate the way that databases will be built up, managed and used in the future, and how this will influence e-Science. For this purpose, these actors were interviewed and official documents on the topic were studied. It is concluded that openness and the integrity of personal data are particularly critical elements for the success of a range of future e-Science endeavours in Sweden and elsewhere.

AB In this article, we investigate which ideational variables influence the propensity of cohabiting couples to transform their union into marriage, separation or continued cohabitation. The question is particularly relevant in the Swedish context of considerable social acceptance of unmarried cohabitation even among parents. A two-wave panel study including 705 never-married respondents cohabiting at the time of the first survey shows that ideational factors influence subsequent behaviour, even when different sets of control variables are included in the model. Familistic attitudes, work-related values and reflections about the quality of the relationship prove to be predictors of the transition to either marriage or separation even when intentions are taken into account.

AB In this article, I analyse the relationship between local context and individuals' social spending preferences in Sweden. The contextual unit studied is the municipality and the analyses are based on both individual-level survey data (n = 5,324) and municipal-level data. Multi-level modelling is used to handle data at both levels simultaneously. It is suggested that the presence of social risks in the local community affects whether individuals are willing to support high social spending. It is argued that the interdependent nature of certain social risks, such as local unemployment rates, depopulation and labour market structure, is an important factor explaining contextual influence on social spending preferences. The results indicate that the prevalence of social risks in a municipality affect the willingness of local inhabitants to support high social spending. Support for high social spending tends to be greater, taking individual-level determinants into account, in municipalities suffering from unemployment, ill health, depopulation, a low tax base and an industry sector dominated by agriculture and manufacturing. This finding also indicates that contextual influence on political attitudes might not be restricted to interpersonal interaction, as often suggested in past research.

AB The article interrogates whether the social background of adolescents affects (1) the quality of their relations with parents and teachers, and (2) the potentially beneficial effects of these relations on school-related and psychological outcomes. Previous studies suggest that social background does affect the quality of social relations, although weakly, and that these in turn affect various outcomes. However, the results are inconclusive as to whether the quality of social relations of different importance for adolescents from different social backgrounds, and such an interaction effect could be predicted from different perspectives. The data are based on a nationally representative sample of Swedish adolescents between 10 and 18 years of age (n = 2,645) and include several aspects of social background, social relations and outcomes. The data are ideally suited to this question, in that information about social relations and outcomes is child-reported, while information on social background is parent-reported and based on register data. The results confirm that social relations are conducive to various outcomes, and show that disadvantaged adolescents have weaker relations with parents and teachers. Furthermore, they imply that relations with teachers are of particular importance for disadvantaged adolescents' school and psychological outcomes, while parental relations are equally important for both advantaged and disadvantaged adolescents.

AB Research on the consequences for employees of opportunities to participate in decision-making (defined here as having autonomy and being able to consult in organizational decisions and to work in teams) has produced inconsistent results. Some writers argue that worker participation is a good thing for workers, since they are able to make decisions and develop skills. Others, especially those in the critical management tradition, regard workers' opportunities to participate in decisions as another form of exploitation that results in increased work intensity, more ambiguity and greater stress. In this article, we examine the consequences of Norwegian workers' participation in decisions on job stress - both directly and through their effect on skill development, workload, support and ambiguity. We find that autonomy and consultation in decisions reduce job stress, while teamwork increases job stress.

AB In this article I investigate attitudes towards a subfield of European welfare states in comparative perspective: minimum income protection. My goal is to demonstrate that certain socio-economic characteristics matter universally for attitude formation, but that their impact varies according to specific welfare state institutions. Analysing poverty risks and the structural position of minimum income protection schemes in the welfare state, I hypothesize that attitudes may be more polarized in generous welfare states than in less generous states. Additionally, I assume that labour market performance may have an influence on attitudes, leading to more sympathetic positions towards state responsibility in times of high unemployment. Using data from Eurobarometer 56.1 (2001) and performing country-wise regressions, I demonstrate that individual socio-economic traits impact on attitudes depending on national contexts. Combining preferences and degrees of polarization shows that attitudes might be formed in the interplay between welfare state and labour market.

AB Cannabis is the most commonly used illegal drug, and numerous studies of cannabis users have been carried out in biomedical and epidemiological disciplines. However, surprisingly few researchers from sociology or other social science disciplines have investigated cannabis use in recent years. During its introduction phase in the 1960s, cannabis use was associated with a so-called 'hang-loose ethic', subversive political values and particular music preferences. In this article I ask whether this continues to be the case. I look for associations that indicate social marginalization and I analyse data from a longitudinal study of the Norwegian population in which a sample was followed from their early teens (in 1992) until their late 20s (in 2005). The results show that the recruitment base for cannabis use during adolescence had much in common with cannabis use in the 1960s. Music preferences such as hip-hop and heavy metal and subversive political attitudes were robust predictors of adolescent initiation into cannabis use. Indicators of parental social marginalization played no role. Conversely, a high level of parental education was positively associated with cannabis initiation. However, when the sample entered their 20s, cannabis users were increasingly located at the margins of society and characterized by poor education, unemployment and low levels of income.

AB Preferred emigration destinations among adolescents reflect images and stereotypes of other countries that continuously emerge in a multitude of local and global discourses and from concrete experiences with other countries. The affinities of Icelandic adolescents are split among the islands of the Northern Atlantic, continental Nordic countries, European core countries and North American countries. If they had to leave Iceland, however, the largest proportion of Icelandic adolescents would want to move to the United States. Girls are more likely to choose the Nordic countries, in particular Denmark, and boys English-speaking countries with a reputation for economic and military power, such as the United States and Britain. Adolescents are more likely to prefer migrating to Europe rather than North America if they are proud of their Icelandic nationality, live in cohesive communities, have more educated parents and feel closer to Europe. Adolescents who want to move abroad are, in contrast, most likely to have North American destinations in mind. Recent geopolitical changes, however, may shift the attention of Icelandic adolescents eastward towards the European continent.

AB The article documents how dual-earner families employ different household strategies when managing time and childcare in everyday life. In particular, the focus is the unforeseen consequences of household strategies, that is, novel emerging problems, cultural ideals and subjectivities. In this ethnographic study of eight middle-class couples in Sweden, I analyse three household strategies: delegating, alternating and multitasking. While parents apparently use these strategies to juggle the multiple demands of everyday life in a time-efficient way, they also comply with a norm of involved parenthood. Thus, when employing household strategies, the parents balance between enacting themselves as involved parents and running the risk of being understood as uninvolved.

AB In this article, I analyse the acquisition of informational capital, i.e. academic capital, measured as student mobility and understood as transnational investments in prestigious foreign educational institutions. In the 1990s, educational 'zones of prestige' were the United States, the United Kingdom and, to some extent, Germany and France. Official statistics from Sweden, Denmark and France regarding the outflow of students reflect increasing student mobility. In particular, the study reveals that students from the upper and upper-middle social classes (measured by parental occupation) are more likely than students from other social classes to pursue transnational investments, even though students from the middle and working classes have now entered the arena. This has also been found in a recent analysis of Danish academic emigrants. All in all, studies confirm the hypothesis that students from the upper classes are more likely than others to invest in specific informational capital in the field of education, in national environments and in international settings.

AB Our aim in this article is to reveal crucial factors affecting the access to higher education claimed in rational action theories in Germany. Data on the educational choices of high school graduates in Saxony support the basic assumptions of the rational choice model suggested by Esser and by Breen and Goldthorpe. First, working-class children are likely to be diverted from higher education by their self-evaluated school achievement. In contrast to expected economic returns from education, theoretically expected class-specific motives of status maintenance are crucial factors in regard to class-specific educational decisions. Besides class differences of expectations regarding intergenerational upward mobility or educational success at university, it is subjective estimation of educational costs that is pivotal in the decision against higher education in favour of alternative vocational education - depending on the actual allocation of financial capital between social classes. The initial economic distribution among high school graduates leads to socially selective educational decisions and, consequently, to inequality of educational opportunity in higher education. While these rational choice theories explain class-related inequality, they do not explain the gender inequality in higher education marginally favouring women.

AB In this article, I set out to test a specific case of group threat theory, namely the size of the minority population. My general aim is to test whether the proportion of immigrants in Swedish municipalities has any effect on anti-immigrant attitudes. More specifically, I examine whether visibility of immigrants matters, via country of origin, as well as whether different contexts intensify the relation between size of the minority population and anti-immigrant attitudes. I conclude that the proportion of the foreign-born population has no effect on anti-immigrant attitudes, whereas people have fewer anti-immigrant attitudes in municipalities with a high proportion of the most visible groups of immigrants. A recent influx of immigrants to the municipality does not matter for levels of anti-immigrant attitudes. However, the economic context matters in that anti-immigrant attitudes of people are strongest in poor municipalities with a large share of immigrants. The political context, on the other hand, does not matter.

AB The marches on 15 February 2003 challenging the imminent attack on Iraq attracted highly heterogeneous demonstrators often engaged in different types of associations and protest activities. In this article, I suggest we expand our view of the mobilizing networks that facilitated people's involvement in the demonstrations by looking not only at associations but also at what I define as 'protest communities', namely, sets of activists sharing a sustained participation in protest activities. Network analysis shows that in some countries peace associations played a more prominent role than peace protest communities, while in other countries the opposite was the case. The former were more central in inclusive political systems, the latter, in exclusive systems. Drawing on a survey of 15 February demonstrators conducted in eight Western democracies, the article highlights the connection between political opportunities and relational, not merely behavioural, variables.

AB In this article, we address how the social networks of Norwegian teenagers influence their formation of social and political resources. We distinguish between youth networks that are adult-managed and networks managed by the youth involved. The analysis is based on two representative surveys, Young in Norway 1992 and 2002. Based on a theoretical framework related to Putnam's theory of social capital, we discuss how young people's declining trust in the authority of adult society and their increased willingness to vote in general elections during the past decade might be understood. The findings imply that the adult-managed networks (generation-bridging) generate trust among the young participators. However, they are no more willing to vote than youth existing outside such networks. On the contrary, youth-managed networks (youth-bonding) in which adults do not have any natural positions or access seem to mobilize young people into participating through elections, even though they show a lower level of trust than their peers outside such networks. The findings imply that the generation gap produces mistrust and an oppositional attitude to the adult world, which has a positive influence on young people's political participation and integration.

AB In cross-national comparative studies of people's social capital, there is a standard practice of measuring social capital using the size and intensity of people's networks. In this article, we discuss the validity of this practice, from both a theoretical and an empirical perspective. Theoretically, the practice is problematic, because it disregards that, according to original authors on the subject, social capital is about people's access to resources in their networks. This means that having network relationships is a necessary, but by no means sufficient, condition for possessing social capital. Empirically, using pooled data from the 2001 ISSP comparative survey, we found some positive relationships between network characteristics and people's potential access to resources in their networks. The relationships are weak, however, which means that the assumption that network characteristics are adequate proxies for social capital is equally weak.

Our results show that there are class differences in sickness absence especially among men, but also among women. The two main underlying factors are education and physical work environment. The results suggest that selection mechanisms and material conditions are important, and prompt the question whether psychosocial work environment explains the marked class differences in sickness absence.

AB In this article, we explore marital exogamy ( especially intermarriage between immigrants and natives) among 39 different immigrant groups using cross-sectional registry data for the total immigrant populations in Sweden in 2003. Immigrants who are better educated, who spend a longer time in Sweden before marriage and live outside the bigger cities are more likely to be married to natives. Controlling for age at immigration, education, time between immigration and marriage, settlement size and the relative size of the immigrant group of the opposite sex, immigrants from Western Europe ( excluding Finland) and the United States are more likely to be married to natives than are other immigrants. We also analyse the link between intermarriage and economic integration, with the results indicating a strong association between intermarriage and economic integration in terms of employment and income. Immigrants married to natives are more likely to be employed, and also to have higher individual and household income.

AB Most research finds that voluntary engagement leads to more political participation. However, it is not entirely clear which type of organization encourages political participation and what skills are required. There is also some discussion about whether multiple memberships promote political participation. In this article, I use the Belgian Youth Survey (n = 6,330) in investigating the effect that type of organization, the time spent in organizations, the number of memberships and skills-related activities has on political participation. My findings suggest that voluntary organizations are powerful political socialization agents leading to young people engaging in politics. Young people who are members of several organizations are more active in politics, while spending a greater amount of time in one organization does not increase level of political participation. Cultural, deliberative and help organizations are more successful than expressive, religious-ethnic and youth groups in fostering political engagement. Finally, organizations that allow young people to take up a leadership role, or to organize activities, encourage participation in political activities.

AB The purpose of this theoretical article is to analyse the social construction of order in two connected markets in the production flow of the global garment industry. The consumer market is identified as a status market, while the production market is defined as a 'standard' market. In a 'status' market, order is maintained because the identities of actors on both sides of the market are ranked according to status, which is a more entrenched social construction than the commodity traded in the market. In a market characterized by 'standard', the situation is the reverse: the commodity is a more entrenched social construction than the identity rankings of actors in the market. The study ties together consumption and production of garments through several markets.

DE Durkheim; moral transgression; norms; ritual; scandal; social drama;
   sociology of morality
AB In this article, we use the case of a government scandal in Sweden to develop a theoretical perspective by which to understand the moral nature of political scandals. We draw on insights from Durkheim's sociology of morality and point, inter alia, to the ritual character of scandals. However, in contrast to most Durkheimian readings, the perspective presented does not presume the existence of a moral consensus. The scandal is understood as a confrontation between various systems of norms. Rather than confirming a given moral order, scandals provoke moral positioning and help in clarifying - and dramatizing - lines of difference or conflict. The empirical case studied is a government scandal in Sweden in 2006 (Nannygate) that forced two government ministers to resign after less than 10 days in office when it was revealed that they had not paid their TV licence and, moreover, had bought 'black' (untaxed) services. This transgression provoked a massive public reaction at the time.

AB The Resource Dilution Hypothesis and related theories predict that sibship size has a negative causal effect on educational attainment. However, because sibship size is likely to be endogenous to children's schooling in the sense that parents who have many children also have other socio-economic characteristics that lead to low educational attainment, it is difficult to determine if sibship size actually has a negative effect on educational attainment or whether the effect is spurious. This article deals with the endogeneity problem by using mothers' and fathers' inherited reproductive capacity as a 'natural' experiment which affects sibship size but which, arguably, has no direct effect on children's educational attainment. I analyse data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study and use information on mothers' and fathers' sibship sizes and age at birth of first child as instruments for sibship size. After correcting for endogeneity, I find that sibship size has a negative causal effect on educational attainment.

AB In this article, I analyse empirically whether the audience attending classical concerts can be subdivided into three segments - following the lead of Howard Becker's Art Worlds (1984). Moreover, I investigate how far these groups have different aesthetic dispositions towards classical music. Based on an extensive audience survey in five institutions staging both symphonic and chamber music in Flanders, Belgium (2005), three groups are distinguished based on the frequency of attendance: the passers-by, the interested participants and the inner circle. It is found that these segments differ in socio-demographic composition, have different motives for attendance and have different aesthetic dispositions towards classical music. Yet, all segments share the wish to be emotionally moved and affected by music. Implications for cultural policy and marketing the arts are discussed.

AB In the work of many of the classics of sociology, religion plays a major role. In post-World War II sociology, however, the study of religion gradually ended up in a marginal position. This article discusses the status of the sociological study of religion in Finland from the post-war period to the present. The focus in the article is on the institutional evolution of the field and the influence of that evolution on the role of the sociology of religion within Finnish sociology. Finnish sociology of religion is divided into three categories: studies carried out in sociology departments, sociological studies carried out within religious studies and church and social studies. The article examines the development and characteristics of each of these disciplines as well as the consequences of institutional scattering for the sociology of religion. The aversion of religion within sociology, the focus on folklore in religious studies and the public identification of church sociology with theology are identified as the reasons for the marginal position of the sociology of religion in Finland. The article closes with a review of recent studies in the sociology of religion and the 'new rise' of the field due to the rise in the societal significance of religion.

AB In this analysis of formal and informal social participation in the Netherlands between 1975 and 2000, period, life-cycle and cohort effects are disentangled and the factors that could have driven these changes are examined. Use of diary data enables an assessment of four types of social participation: formal involvement in associations, maintenance of informal contacts within the home and outside the home, and distant social contacts. Our results indicate that several changes have been taking place. A large decrease (of approximately 3 hours per week between 1980 and 2000) is found in the time people spend on social activities within the home (consisting mainly of paying visits and receiving visitors). This trend is connected with increases in work and television watching. Other changes manifest themselves as cohort differences. While younger cohorts reflect considerably less activity in formal participation, they spend more time on informal social activities outside the home. Decreasing levels of religiosity play a role with respect to both trends.

AB This article develops a framework for studying individuals' ideas about what constitutes just compensation for chief executive officers (CEOs) and reports estimates of just CEO pay and the principles guiding ideas of justice. The sample consists of students pursuing a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree in Sweden and the United States. The framework, based on justice theory and making use of Rossi's factorial survey method, enables assessment of ideas of fairness in CEO compensation, including (1) the just CEO compensation, in the eyes of each observer; (2) the principles of microjustice-observers' ideas about 'who should get what' based on characteristics of CEOs and their firms; and (3) principles of macrojustice-ideas about the just level and dispersion in compensation across all CEOs. Our estimates yield the following main results: First, there is broad agreement on the median just CEO compensation but substantial inter-individual variation in the principles of microjustice and the other principles of macrojustice. Second, there is remarkable similarity in the distributions of the principles of microjustice and macrojustice across the MBA groups. Other important results include a pervasive gender attentiveness among MBA students and tolerance for large variability in CEO pay.

AB This article investigates the effect that various individual-level determinants have on social capital, this in order to find out whether there are differences between transition and non-transition countries in Europe. The novelty lies in more comprehensive sets of both the determinants and the dimensions of social capital covered. Data from the World Values Survey of 31 European countries (including 16 transition countries) are analysed. Based on estimates of the measurement and structural model of all countries individually, the countries are clustered within three groups to facilitate comparison of transition and non-transition countries. In contrast to previous results, the findings of this study provide support for the argument that the sources of social capital are remarkably different between transition and non-transition countries. Moreover, the results indicate that subgroups have to be distinguished within both of these country groups.

AB Science is being published increasingly on the web. In this article, we explore how Nordic sociology is represented on Google Scholar (GS), what its output and impact is, and what factors explain it. Our data consist of faculty in 16 Nordic sociology departments in March 2005. The distribution of their publications and citations is skewed. Thirteen per cent of scholars do not appear on GS, whereas only 15 per cent have more than 5 publications. Of scholars with at least 1 publication (n = 240), 75 per cent have at most 10 citations. Both the number of web hits (web visibility) and citations are influenced by the gender of the faculty member, type and age of publication. Web visibility, citations and position are mutually reinforcing. Departmental effect is greater in web visibility than citations. International publications have started to dominate the social sciences, international monographs being particularly frequently cited. The remaining salience of books shows that sociology is still a distinct form of knowledge. The exclusive use of refereed articles and direct comparisons with the natural sciences ignore important aspects of the social sciences. In all, while GS produces findings similar to those in citation databases such as the SSCI, some systematic differences exist. No individual method for measuring scientific output is objective.

AB The issue of what people consider as reasons for living in poverty is often neglected in the literature on poverty. Studies of public perceptions are needed both on academic grounds and in terms of policy-making processes. In this article, I study three different meanings of poverty: the individualistic, the fatalistic and the structural. I explore whether different meanings can be attributed to specific socio-demographic characteristics, economic circumstances and attitudes towards the welfare state. The data derive from a cross-sectional survey conducted in Finland in 2005 and the results indicate that there is strong consensus in the Finnish population on the causes of poverty. Finns are more likely to blame the flaws and inadequacies of the labour market than the behaviour of individuals or societal injustice. In other words, structural explanations of poverty have the greatest support. However, fatalistic explanations are also supported, since a considerable proportion of people regard bad luck and lack of opportunities as reasons for poverty. Applied multivariate analysis indicates that perceptions of the causes of poverty are at least to some extent related to socio-demographic characteristics, economic circumstances and attitudes to the welfare state. However, the effects, as well as the group differences, are small.

TI Voluntary social work as a paradox
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
DE communication; paradoxes; system theory; voluntary social work; welfare
   policy
AB This article is written as an invitation to sociologists to rethink the concept of voluntary social work. Rather than comprehensive theory, it is an essay seeking to explore new ways of perceiving voluntary social effort. Voluntary work has traditionally been defined according to whether or not the subject of the study is organized and unpaid. However, these formal measures overlook the fact that much voluntary work is provided by people who do not fit the categories, and they fail to recognize the special nature of voluntary social work. In this article, we employ the works of the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann to examine what happens when voluntary social work is constructed as a particular form of care work. In this perspective, all care work is formed in the context of opposing expectation structures, and voluntary work is no exception. On the one hand, we have the expectation structures of the persons involved in care; on the other, the expectations of the administrative system and the political, juridical and economic layers of organization. Our assertion is that voluntary social work is fundamentally paradoxical in nature, and is formed as an impossible compromise between interactional and organizational logic. The question is not how to resolve or dissolve this paradox, but how to render it productive as a certain tension in the opportunity for voluntary work. Before we elaborate this thesis further, however, we briefly outline the background of social work and the reason why, today, it is followed especially closely by the state. This means looking at the way in which the couplings between welfare practice and voluntary work have traditionally been defined. While the article refers only to Danish social policy, very similar tendencies can be observed in many other Western welfare societies (see, for example, Wolch, 1990; Smith and Lipsky, 1993; Eikaas, 2001; Lynn, 2002; Reisch and Sommerfeld, 2003).

ID ATTACKS; SEPTEMBER-11; THREAT
AB Although the psychological stress created by terror has been extensively researched, little has been written about the subjective experience of living with terror. How do people perceive risk and how do they adjust their daily lives? The Lebanese capital Beirut suffered from a wave of bomb attacks following the assassination of Lebanon's former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on 14 February 2005. In order to examine people's reactions and ways of coping with these events, 14 focus group interviews (n = 77) were conducted in targeted areas. The findings suggest that Beirutis. could no longer rely on the taken-for-granted routines of daily life. By changing their routes to school or work and avoiding public places, they restricted their daily activities. However, the data also suggest that targeted people attempted to normalize their everyday lives. Two strategies were employed. The first can be described as bracketing in time and space, which means that people tried to benefit from periods they perceived as moments of reprieve, and that they defined business and private space as safe havens. Bracketing can also be described as re-normalization, i.e. as an attempt to return to the previous state of 'normality'. The other strategy can be described as crisis normalization and means that the new evaluations of the risks and new patterns of action adopted, which originally deviated from people's established routines, themselves became routinized.

AB Has the frequency of unemployment a tendency to increase the number of social assistance recipients, or does the relationship work the other way round? This article utilizes Swedish monthly data on aggregated open unemployment and means-tested social assistance recipiency in the period 1991-2004 and proposes a multiple time-series approach based on vector error-correction modelling in order to distinguish between theories about the direction of influence. First, we show that rates of unemployment and receipt of social assistance are co-integrated. Second, we demonstrate that adjustments to the long-run equilibrium are made through adjustments to the receipt of means-tested social assistance. This indicates that the frequency of social assistance recipiency reacts to changes in unemployment rather than vice versa. It is also shown that lagged changes in the number of social assistance recipients do not predict changes in rates of unemployment in the short term. Together, these findings demonstrate that the number of social assistance recipients does not increase the number of unemployed.

ID FRANCE; FOOD; DIET; LIFE
AB This article examines changes in aspects of the eating habits of the populations of five countries between the early 1970s and the end of the 1990s. Time-use diary data provide the main evidence, which is subjected to techniques of statistical description and regression analysis. The study of France, UK, USA, Norway and the Netherlands shows considerable national variation in patterns of food preparation, eating at home and eating out. Each of these components of the practice of eating is examined for indications of whether there are any tendencies towards dedifferentiation within countries or convergence across countries. There are some common patterns across countries, notably a decline in the amount of time devoted to food preparation. Time spent on eating at home reduces in all countries except France. In the USA, time devoted to domestic food preparation and consumption is minimal. Internal differentiation shows continuities - of gender divisions and age-related behaviour - but also new emergent tendencies - with the presence of children and levels of cultural capital becoming significant predictors of behaviour. It is maintained that the analysis of time-use provides a useful framework for comparing practices in different countries and that the variation revealed might best be understood in terms of different modes of institutionalization of consumption.

ID POLICY
AB Redistributive policies concerning migrants in The Netherlands bear a striking degree of ethnic specificity. This characteristic seems to follow from the doctrine 'integration with maintenance of own culture' that has long informed Dutch minority policies. However, both central and local governments stopped subscribing to this doctrine at least a decade ago, while ethnically specific policy arrangements have continued to grow. This article explains the anomaly from an administrative mechanism: the logic of categorization for policy-making contradicts the logic of policy implementation. The use of what we call 'replacement categories' creates an administrative opportunity structure that unintentionally promotes ethnic fragmentation. We examine the workings of this mechanism in a case study of minority policy in The Netherlands.

AB This article sheds light on the impact of class origin on career mobility by focusing on downward mobility from the so-called. Service I class, which is the most privileged class of employees within the EGP (Erikson-Goldthorpe-Portocarero) class schema. A substantial proportion of the incumbents within Service I originate from the working class. It could be assumed that these people would experience higher levels of downward career mobility. Using Swedish survey data with panels covering the time period 1982 to 2001, this hypothesis receives support for women but not for men. A lower level of educational attainment characteristic of people originating in the working class seems to explain part, but not all, of the association between class origin and downward career mobility. An explanation is suggested based on the assumption of different responses to the problem of combining family and working life for women with different class origins.

AB Youth labour market integration differs considerably across European countries. There are marked cross-national differences not only in terms of youth unemployment, but also in terms of the quality of the jobs in which young people are employed. This article explains cross-national patterns of labour market entry among school-leavers in 11 European countries. It is hypothesized that national differences in employment protection legislation and the vocational specificity of the education system, in addition to the structural effect of macro-economic conditions, attribute to the observed cross-national variation in youth labour market integration. On the basis of the European Union LFS 2000 ad hoc module on school-to-work transitions, the speed, the quality and the stability of the labour market entry process are analysed. The results indicate that national institutional differences regarding employment protection legislation and the vocational specificity of the education system do indeed affect cross-national differences in labour market entry patterns. However, the impact of both institutional features varies considerably by level of education.

AB In this article we start from Boudon's important, but still surprisingly neglected, distinction between 'primary' and 'secondary' effects in the creation of class differentials in educational attainment. Primary effects are all those, whether of a genetic or socio-cultural kind, that are expressed via the association between children's class backgrounds and their actual levels of academic performance. Secondary effects are those that are expressed via the educational choices that children from differing c lass backgrounds make within the range of choice that their previous performance allows them. We apply a method introduced by Erikson and jonsson to represent the relationship between primary and secondary effects in analysing class differentials in one crucial transition within the English and Welsh educational system: that which children make at around age 16 and which determines whether or not they will pursue the higher-level academic qualifications A-levels - that are usually required for university entry. We then use a development of this method that we have earlier proposed in order to produce quantitative estimates of the relative importance of primary and secondary effects as they operate within this transition. We show that secondary effects reinforce primary effects to a substantial extent, accounting for at least one quarter, and possibly up to one-half, of class differentials as measured by odds ratios. In conclusion, we consider some theoretical and policy implications of our findings.

ID PARTICIPATION; ATTAINMENT; GENDER
AB The transition research framework combines two selection mechanisms, one non-discriminatory, based on equality criteria for transition from home to education, the other discriminatory, based on suitability criteria for transition from education to labour market. With the expansive, egalitarian Nordic higher education policy as its starting point, and drawing on Bourdieuan-Collinsian ideas and Finnish census data, the article examines changes in inequality of educational opportunity and labour market returns to university graduates over the course of three decades. Two elite university generations (born in 1946 and 1966) and one mass higher education age group (born in 1976) are compared by gender and family background. Differences in participation in university education, as measured by odds ratios, have narrowed in three generations by a sequence: 19.1-10.8-8.2, being still eightfold in favour of students from academic families. The differences in relative returns to university graduates (academic versus non-academic background) were minimal for those born in 1946 (1.01), whereas for the '1966 generation' they were threefold (3.17) in favour of graduates from academic homes. Our simulations predict high returns for the 1966 generation at the mature career stage.

ID INEQUALITY
AB The Scandinavian countries are often assumed to constitute a coherent and unique social service model characterized by a comparatively high level of universalism and a strong capacity to defamilialize care responsibilities. In examining whether we really can identify such a model when comparing current social service systems, social services in the Scandinavian countries are contrasted with their counterparts in three continental European countries. The resulting data indicate that only Denmark complies with the image of the Scandinavian social service model. Both Norway and Sweden deviate significantly. Norwegian childcare services and Swedish elderlycare services do not stand out as particularly universalistic or defamilializing compared with those of other Western European countries. Given these findings, it may be questioned whether it is reasonable to speak of a 'Scandinavian social service model'.

ID SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION; PRODUCTIVITY; WORK
AB Collaboration is an important part of scientific practice and work. This analysis of how field experimental collaborations within atmospheric science are organized focuses on how relations between researchers are established and how this is related to the mobilization of resources. It is argued that these relationships can be understood by being considered from the point of view of the different researcher roles that researchers play in relation to each other. The article outlines three different roles: the entrepreneur, the integrated experimentalist and the instrument expert. These roles differ in terms of their position in the organization of projects and in the role measurement instruments play for researchers in their work as well as in relation to other roles. The article also discusses how the different roles of measurement instruments affect how and when researchers become involved in collaborative projects.

AB This article is concerned with the question of the relevance of the results of sociological research external to the discipline - or, in other words, with the form of dealing with sociological knowledge in the environment of the scientific system. When it comes to application, compared to other disciplines sociology has an unusual problem: Unlike jurisprudence or economics, which focus primarily on one specific social function system, sociology is characterized by a strictly external observation perspective and produces external descriptions of what the disciplines of the individual function systems have already put forward as self-descriptions. Based on these reflections, this article asks about the consequences for sociological theory and practice and sees one possible answer in viewing sociology as a form of advisory sociology.

DE global consciousness; media; Muhammed cartoons; porous public; public

AB This article uses the twin concepts of the porous public and the transnational dialectic to analyse the recent Muhammed cartoons conflict. The porous public concept points to the way national public spheres are increasingly penetrated by inbound and outbound influences. The transnational dialectic concept suggests that globalization is a learning process in which globalization is simultaneously outcome and cause of social and political activities. During the cartoons conflict, the porosity of the Danish public was evident in (1) the transnational activities of national media, in (2) the role played by transnational news channels, in (3) the transnational activities of Muslims living in Denmark, and in (4) the role played by 9/11 as a transnationally shared event. Based on these findings, the concept of the transnational dialectic is employed to show how the Muhammed cartoons conflict constituted a learning process for Danish society a process which has resulted in an increased level of global consciousness and an altered self-conception of Denmark's place and role in the world. Following the analysis of the Muhammed cartoons, the article discusses how the concept of the porous public relates to that of the transnational public sphere.

AB New concepts have emerged in social work and in social policy over the past 10-15 years: 'you must meet the clients where they stand', 'help must be self-help' and 'poverty is spiritual rather than material'. These axioms were core principles for the welfare of the poor that philanthropic and religious societies carried out in the late nineteenth century. Their current proliferation in an types of social work and in social policy discourse demonstrates a profound transformation in the discursive structures of welfare policy - that is, in the way social problems can be visualized and spoken about, in the way that clients can be observed and turned into objects of knowledge, and in the way that professionals can conceptualize such abstract notions as integration, citizenship, community and freedom. This article investigates the genealogy of modem social work to help us reconsider what kind of individual and what kind of community we are now attempting to create.

DT Article
DE contract; Durkheim; governance; hexicology public management; spencer;
   society welfare state
AB The sociological concept of 'society' has been questioned in multiple ways in recent decades. However, one central aspect of the notion has been taken so much for granted that no one has challenged it: society is not a plan and cannot be based on an agreement. Yet contemporary societies increasingly rely on voluntary contracts between individuals, groups, organizations, enterprises, states and their organs or officials. In this article, I argue that new contractualism cannot be explained simply as an expansion of the market at the expense of the state. The contract is an illusion that disguises relations of domination as voluntary partnership. It stresses agency to a point where autonomy is not only granted to but demanded of even those who have little or no capacity for it. The illusion of the contract has real consequences on how societies are governed and how they relate to each other. This is the reason why the concept of society no longer has the sense of an entity Consequently, sociology has turned from a study of societies to a study of practices. The term hexicology is suggested for this new orientation.

AB In this article, I investigate the strength of intergenerational transmission of volunteering for non-profit associations in The Netherlands. Data from the Family Survey of the Dutch Population 2000 reveal that there are significant relations between current volunteering and parental volunteering in the past. While the transmission of volunteering for religious and quasi-religious ('pillarized') associations is due largely to the transmission of religion and social status from parents to their children, parental volunteering for pillarized associations has increased the likelihood of children's volunteering for secular associations, even controlling for parental and children's religion, education, wealth and personality characteristics. Consistent with a value internalization explanation, this spillover effect was not due to the direct social pressure of parents.

AB The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the concept of social capital and to distinguish its different forms, focusing on their potential effects on health. According to many scholars, social capital comprises social networks, norms of reciprocity or social support and social trust. In this article the core element, the social network, has been further distinguished by the direction of ties and levels of formality, strength and diversity. In the past few years there has been increased interest in social capital in the health field and a great deal of research has suggested that social capital is generally positively related to health. However, little research has been conducted into how different forms of social capital or social networks influence health. What is the difference, for instance, between bonding and bridging social capital in terms of health outcomes? It is important to distinguish the different forms because they imply different resources, support and obligations. More research needs to be conducted into the different forms of social capital and their effects on health. A special focus should be placed on the health impacts of cross-cutting - or bridging and linking - forms of social capital.

AB The employment structure of The Netherlands and other advanced countries is evolving from industrial to postindustrial. Yet existing social class schemata, like the well-known Erikson, Goldthorpe and Portocarero (EGP) class schema, were constructed for an industrial employment structure. In this study, we adjust the EGP class schema to account for this transformation by using new class theories. We distinguish a 'new' class of social and cultural specialists and an 'old' class of technocrats with both a higher and a lower version in the service class. Our research question concerns the extent to which the adjusted EGP class schema is a better predictor of people's political orientation than the standard EGP class schema. We assume that the 'new' classes differ in their political orientation from the 'old' classes. We also assume that, during their formation, the 'new' classes become increasingly effective in explaining differences in people's political orientation. Experts' knowledge is employed to classify the occupations. In addition, we use the data of 34,856 respondents gathered between 1970 and 2003 in The Netherlands. The adjusted EGP class schema explains people's political orientation substantially better than the standard EGP class schema; the 'new' classes vote significantly more for leftist parties and differ substantially in their political orientation from the 'old' classes. Furthermore, our results show that the political orientation of the low-grade social and cultural specialists has become more crystallized since 1970.

AB Inglehart's short postmaterialism index uses partial ranking of four items to classify respondents within three classes, i.e. a materialist, a postmaterialist and a mixed category. An appropriate technique for validating this index is a latent class choice model. Analysing data from the Eurobarometer surveys with this approach confirms the existence of a postmaterialist class. However, a materialist class cannot be identified irrevocably. Rather, an 'authoritarian' or 'conservative' latent class has to be distinguished from an 'economic materialist' latent class. As such, there is empirical evidence for theoretical arguments that have been raised in the past, even within the restricted framework of the Inglehart thesis. Furthermore, I demonstrate that the cohort variable is unrelated to the 'economic materialist' latent class, putting strain on adherents of the scarcity hypothesis. Education proves to be the key covariate of 'economic' materialism, whereas cohort differences are pronounced in the case of 'maintaining order in the nation'. Country differences also shift depending on the latent class model that is selected.

AB While the concept of social capital has rekindled interest in fundamental issues of social inquiry, concerns have been raised regarding its definition and application in increasingly diverse topics. We address these concerns by revisiting Coleman's and Bourdieu's original ideas of the role of family and school in adolescent outcomes. Multi-level modelling reveals that controlling for individual background, parental relations and adolescent activities, school levels of intergenerational closure and cultural activities are predictive of higher maths grades, while school levels of intergenerational closure, supervised activities and sports participation are predictive of less alcohol use. The results support the general thrust of social capital theory and suggest further theoretical elaborations.

AB A conventional assumption within sociology of markets is that social ties are crucial in economic life, but that too strong relationships between sellers and buyers can create role conflicts and restrict business. Using qualitative interviews with Norwegian exporters and Danish importers, this article examines transactions in the international fish trade. We find that the assumed episodic and highly competitive commodity trade is rooted in dyadic networks and personal trust; inspired by the work of Goffman, we analyse transaction patterns as 'interaction order'. The transaction pattern is dependent on a particular organization of social interaction, interaction in which business dealings are divided into delimited spheres of the 'formal', 'personal' and 'private'. This division reflects a differentiation of the social roles, one in which traders avoid the role conflicts inherent in close relationships. We conclude by stating that economic sociology should probably be less preoccupied with formal network configurations and instead be focused more on how actors actually use social ties in the marketplace to conduct business, and on how these ties are linked to price mechanisms.

AB The aim of the study was to identify the specific factors that affect the risk of attempted suicide in Norwegian gay, lesbian and bisexual (GLB) youths beyond the effect of general risk factors presumed to be of importance irrespective of sexual orientation. The national non-probability sample included 407 GLB youths aged between 16 and 25 years of age, among whom 26 per cent of both genders reported a previous suicide attempt. General risk factors for attempted suicide among GLB youths were: lack of parental contact, internalizing problems (depression/anxiety), low self-esteem, regular smoking and victimization. The following risk factors specific for GLB youths increased the risk of attempted suicide even when controlling for general risk factors: currently being in a steady heterosexual relationship, early heterosexual debut (<16), young age of coming out (<15), infrequent contact with heterosexual friends and openness to all heterosexual friends. For practitioners engaged in social work among young people in general or GLB youths in particular, these results show that while coming out is a vital aspect of sexual identity formation that enhances psychological well-being and should be celebrated, in another sense it is a serious stressor with potentially negative consequences unless a strong social support network is there to be relied upon.

ID ASSIMILATION
AB Integration of ethnic minorities into society is often operationalized as participation in various societal institutions. Examples are cultural, political and labour participation. On the basis of the theoretical concepts of social and cultural capital as proposed by sociologists Bourdieu and Coleman, it is often hypothesized that greater parental participation in society will generally lead to a better educational position for the children of such parents. To test this hypothesis, descriptive and multi-level analyses were conducted using data from the Dutch cohort study Primary Education. The sample included information on nearly 11,000 kindergarten students (6-year-olds) from almost 600 primary schools. In the analyses, ethnic minority parents and their children were compared to native Dutch parents and their children. After controlling for parental socio-economic and ethnic background, the results showed an effect of cultural participation only on language and mathematics skills. No effects on non-cognitive outcomes, such as social position, individual well-being or self-confidence, were found.

AB This article is about the erosion of the Norwegian democratic infrastructure, with particular emphasis on the causes and effects of the transformation of the voluntary sector and the decline of social movements. We are seeing a turning away from large-scale ideological mass movements and an increase in smaller and nimbler associations that are better at catering for individual needs and wishes, but poorer in plugging members into the central decision-making institutions. This is putting increasing pressure on the Norwegian social contract, which has been characterized by high levels of institutional centralization balanced by high levels of citizen control. We relate these important changes in the democratic infrastructure to the impact of globalization, highlighting structural similarities between globalization and the new organizational forms of political or civic participation. Our argument is that globalization is a process that has particular structural characteristics, and that these characteristics are giving shape to the new forms of civic participation that are now emerging in Norway (and probably also in the rest of Scandinavia).

AB This article brings together two research traditions: social movement theory and theories of corporate social responsibility. The study is an attempt to widen the perspective on the relationship between a business/business sector and its external stakeholders in order to include social movements. We depart from a three-part model of political opportunity structures, including state, cultural and economic opportunity structures. In order to illustrate our model, the article is centred on the case of the Swedish animal rights movements' political pressure on domestic fur-farming. The animal rights movement has had considerable success by engaging with a relatively open cultural opportunity structure, winning a framing war in regard to the moral issues raised. Despite the fur industry's attempts to counter-mobilize, the animal rights movement has found a hearing in formal political channels and has achieved considerable success. However, since the movement is faced with an economic opportunity structure that is not vulnerable to the demands of stakeholders, and where there is great inconsistency between the interests of the industry and the demands of the stakeholders, it is not surprising that the farmers have been non-compliant.

AB Although work-life 'balance' is an EU policy priority, within Europe there are considerable variations in the nature and extent of supports that national governments have offered to dual-earner families. In general, the Nordic welfare states offer the highest level of supports, although other countries, such as France, have historically offered extensive childcare supports to working mothers. We examine national variations in reported levels of work-life conflict, drawing upon questions fielded in the 2002 Family module International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) surveys for Britain, France, Finland, Norway and Portugal. We find evidence of a 'societal effect' in the cases of Finland and Norway, in that significantly lower levels of work-life conflict are reported in these countries even after a range of factors have been controlled for. However, support for childcare in France does not appear to have had a similar impact. Further explorations of the data reveal that the domestic division of labour is relatively traditional in France, and that this is associated with higher levels of work-life conflict.

AB A central component of institutional trust is related to perceptions of state capacity. Claims have been made that if citizens' experiences with the state tell them that the government is efficacious, fair and trustworthy, then the odds for supporting publicly financed welfare policies are higher compared to a situation when their experiences with government feed feelings of inefficiency, corruption, unfairness and arbitrary discretion. The general question guiding the empirical analysis is the following: Is distrust in institutional capability an important prerequisite for general welfare state support withdrawal? Relying on Swedish nationally representative survey data, this issue is examined using Latent Class Analysis (LCA). Empirical evidence suggests that distrust in the institutional capability of the welfare state has not translated into widespread anti-welfare state sentiments. For some citizens, distrust in the capability of the welfare state is an issue of insufficient resources and they are willing to increase social spending in order to improve social services and benefits. For other citizens, distrust is closely connected with antiwelfare state sentiments. The article discusses the implications of the results for arguments about institutional trust and welfare state support.

AB Does mass immigration and increasing ethnic diversity challenge the legitimacy of the universal welfare state? Assuming that basic income can be seen as a radical extension of the universal welfare state, we pursue this question by investigating whether popular reactions towards a basic income proposal are susceptible to persuasion that invokes attitudes towards immigration. The study is based on survey data covering a representative sample of the Norwegian electorate. We find that a comfortable majority express sympathy with the idea of a basic income, and that the structure of initial support for the basic income proposal is well in line with established findings concerning attitudes towards welfare state institutions and redistributive policies more generally. However, by applying a persuasion experiment, we show that negative attitudes towards immigration can be mobilized to significantly reduce the scope of support for a basic income proposal among the Norwegian electorate.

AB The prevailing view in the research literature is that social origin has little impact on educational choices made late in one's educational career. The article focuses on one very late transition, viz. enrolment in PhD programmes. The most important theoretical point of departure is the Breen and Goldthorpe relative risk aversion (RRA) theory. The analyses show that class origins have an impact, but only in how individuals at the very top of the class hierarchy deviate from the rest. There are also considerable effects of having parents who have themselves taken doctoral degrees and of having parents employed in higher education or research. The results do not support the RRA theory with mobility defined in terms of class, but they are consistent with a modified version in which individuals are assumed to be concerned about their educational mobility irrespective of whether or not additional education affects class position.

AB Claude Levi-Strauss hinted that society was like a language. Kenneth Pike's distinction between emic and etic vernaculars probes the relation between the language in a society and the language of social science. Our thesis is that etic scholarly language that classifies social reality is synonymous with some deep linguistic structure (in Noam Chomsky's sense) of everyday emic language, in some measure unconscious for the user, but discoverable by science. Adding insights of Charles Morris and Charles Stevenson, we maintain that language becomes differentiated into descriptive, evaluative and prescriptive usages, each of which contains executive and emotive components. Such a language can codify societal orders, represent riches, summarize knowledge, embody beauty, define sacredness and express virtues. It can be subject to the operations of the common language of sciences, i.e. logics, mathematics and statistics. It opens an easy door to social structuration and can rephrase dramas of human life.

AB In this article, sexual policy in Finland is analysed through two historical cases: first, contraception guidance and medical-psychological marital counselling at the Family Federation of Finland's (Vaestoliitto) dispensaries from the late 1940s to the early 1960s, and, second, comprehensive sex education for adolescents from the 1970s to the 1990s. The study focuses on two modes of sexual government, namely the pastoral mode, which subjects individuals to expertise on sexuality, and self-government based on self-inspection. It is emphasized that in Finland sexuality has been problematized and governed in the context of medicine and health care. The most noticeable dissimilarity between the two settings is that in the former the locus of problematization of the sexual self is sexual adjustment in the nuclear family and marriage, while in the latter sexuality is defined in an individualistic manner, and the core question concerns personal sexual liberation. However, in both settings an understanding of sexuality as one's own initially developed in the context of problems of reproductive health and contraception. In addition, women and female sexuality remained the focus of sexual government throughout the period under study.

AB Since the early 1980s, healthcare systems in welfare states have undergone a process of transformation, with the convergence towards different forms of managed care as one of its central characteristics. The process has also brought about changes within the medical profession. Most physicians, and some sociologists, understand the transformation as a process of deprofessionalization. This article presents an alternative explanation, understanding changes as a process of redistribution of power and resources within the profession, and as a change in the relationship between the medical profession and the hegemonic bloc.

DE alcoholic beverages; alcohol policy; coffee; cultural change; distilled
   sprits; time series analysis
AB Was the decline in alcohol consumption, experienced in many countries during the nineteenth century, related to growth of the coffee culture? This question is approached first through a simple content analysis of qualitative data obtained from an empirical sociological study of inebriety in Norway in the 1850s by Norway's first sociologist, Eilert Sundt [1859], then by a time-series analysis of quantitative data on coffee and alcoholic beverages in Norway. The results confirm that coffee filled a cultural 'niche' created by the restrictive Norwegian alcohol policy in the nineteenth century. Sundt's qualitative data point clearly in this direction. Although the quantitative data - particularly on coffee - are far from ideal indicators of consumption, the results lend some credibility to the substitution hypothesis: The trends coincide fairly closely for the two beverages, and in the detrended series there are measurable signs of correlation when the confounding effects of economic development are controlled for. It is concluded that the political attempts to reduce alcohol problems in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, i.e. reduced availability and increased taxes, may have been alleviated by the growing popularity of coffee as an alternative, 'new' beverage for the population at large, and not just the higher social classes.

AB People today lead busy, hurried lives with competing time claims between the spheres of paid work and the household. The aim of this article is to provide more insight into the way men and women experience the multiple claims on their time and to attempt to understand the differences between European countries in this respect. Are we able to draw a sharp line in the work-family balance experienced in eastern and western Europe? Expectations are formulated at the individual level (work and home-related factors) and at the contextual level (gender culture and family policy). Data were gathered in 2001 within the international research programme 'Households, Work and Flexibility', financed by the European Union. The eight countries included in the analyses are Sweden, the Netherlands, UK, Slovenia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania and Bulgaria, and hypotheses are tested using multivariate regression analyses. At the contextual level, results reflect more support for the gender culture hypothesis than for the family friendly policy hypothesis. The multiplicity of options in western European countries due to the emancipation process causes time pressure. Individual factors are especially important in explaining combination pressure in the three western European countries: long working hours, overtime work, demanding job and having young children all add to the pressure men and women experience.

AB This article investigates which socio-economic and ideological factors make individuals support the normative principles of the welfare state. Two principal theoretical perspectives, relating to self-interest and the political ideology, respectively, have been proposed in the literature as causal explanations. However, as most studies utilize solely cross-sectional data, causal interpretations of which factors make people express support for the welfare state have so far been hard to sustain. This article, using panel data from the Canadian 'Equality Security, and Community' survey and an extended random-effect model, exploits the longitudinal nature of the data and econometric methods to provide a more accurate analysis of the extent to which self-interest and political ideology actually determine support for welfare state principles. The empirical analysis indicates that both self-interest and political ideology variables to some extent are significant predictors of support for welfare state principles. In addition, the article discusses several avenues for future research.

AB At the end of the 1960s, a prisoners' movement critical of the prison system developed in the Scandinavian countries. Particularly strong in Norway, the key expression of this abolitionist movement was the notion of 'the unfinished'. The political message of the Norwegian Prison Movement (KROM) is that the unfinished state of politics towards any desired socio-political development should be considered not as a flaw, but rather as a political possibility. The discussion among Norwegian criminologists and sociologists of law critical of the combination of treatment and criminal justice in the 1950s and 1960s was an indispensable condition for the development of a politics of abolition. This article sketches the central arguments of the discussion, and a connection is established between the abolitionist perspective and sociological theory.

AB Typical of Erik Allardt's quality as a scholar and an intellectual is a willingness and a capacity to take into consideration opposite positions in the same analysis and to act at the interface of the national and international levels. This quality appears most clearly in his theory of the preconditions of solidarity, in which both 'rational' and 'irrational' reactions to the adversities of modernization are explained by the same set of variables. His best scholarly and other intellectual contributions make a fruitful connection between domestic Finnish concerns and elements of the non-Finnish sociological discussion. This Janus-faced position differentiates Allardt from Stein Rokkan, who in many other respects is comparable to him.

TI Social capital in Europe - Measurement and social and regional
   distribution of a multifaceted phenomenon
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
DE European values; mapping; social capital
ID ORIGINS
AB This article sorts the various aspects of social capital (networks, trust, civism) theoretically and constructs an instrument for measuring its multifacetedness. The instrument is validated using data from the 1999/2000 wave of the European Values Study survey. Using the same data, the article describes how social capital, by its various aspects, is distributed geographically among European countries and regions (North, West, South, East), and socially among social categories of European citizens. As far as the geographical distribution of social capital is concerned, there are some particular differences, but, on the whole, European countries and regions, with the possible exception of Northern Europe, appear not to be substantially different in aggregate levels of social capital. In Scandinavia, social capital levels tend to be slightly higher, with the exception of family bonding. Some remarkable European patterns are found in regard to the social distribution of social capital. There is evidence of accumulation of human, economic and social capital; social capital is strongly gendered and is related to religious beliefs and behaviour, and to a political left-right stance.

AB Even though voluntary sport organizations make up the largest part of the voluntary sector in many western countries, few studies have been carried out focusing on sport as part of civil society. Against this background, the aim of the article is to study how voluntary sport organizations operate and what social and political effects they might have through the concept of social capital. The theoretical part of the article identifies the most useful dimensions of the social-capital concept for this topic, lists hypotheses and suggests three relevant social mechanisms. Empirical studies show how social capital related to participation in voluntary sport organizations is distributed and the consequences this has for various forms of social capital: generalized trust and political commitments. Analyses are based on Norwegian data. The results show that being a member of a voluntary sport organization involves social capital which is conducive to generalized trust and political commitment. Yet, the effect of sport organizations is weaker than for voluntary organizations in general, stronger when membership in sport organizations goes together with other memberships (more weak ties) and stronger the less politicized the social effect in question.

SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
DE civic participation; socialization; time allocation; volunteering
AB In this article, two possible explanations for the disproportionate aging of volunteers are tested using the Dutch Time Budget Studies 1985-2000. The first explanation holds that increasing time pressure among, especially, couples aged between 25 and 55, keeps this group from participating. This could not be corroborated by the data, as voluntary work declined among all population segments observed, irrespective of their combined workload of paid and unpaid labour or their family situation (living alone or with a partner). The second explanation assumes that differences in socialization are responsible for the observed divergence between generations. This was confirmed for most fields of voluntary work. Both men and women tend to keep up their level of voluntary activity well into old age.

AB State of research: Despite immense popularity among contemporary social scientists, opinions are divided on how social capital should be defined and measured. In fact, few inquiries have attempted to demonstrate a stable empirical correlate, e.g. through tests for internal consistency and construct stability. Theory: Social capital is constituted and sustained through processes similar to an iterated k-player coordination game; a crucial aspect is whether individuals can utilize the social context as a medium for gaining utilities. Indicators describing how individuals perceive various aspects of the 'game' can be used to identify and study social capital on the individual level. Four potential indicators are considered: (1) interpersonal trust, (2) the respondent's social network, (3) self-efficacy, and (4) membership in voluntary associations. Method and data: Various factor models are tested for cross-context stability and unidimensionality in three subsamples with highly different demographic and socio-economic characteristics; construct stability is presumed to indicate a stable empirical correlate. Finnish survey data from 2001 (n=1439) are used. Results: Cross-context stability is demonstrated for a construct based on interpersonal trust, social network and self-efficacy, which corresponds to the concept introduced by James Coleman.

TI Crowds and pathos - Theodor Geiger on revolutionary action
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
DE community; differentiation; Empire; multitude; society; sociology of
   crowds
AB Theodor Geiger is one of the sociological discipline's unappreciated classics. This article focuses on a particular and often neglected part of his work, the study of revolutionary crowds. The article has two main objectives. First, it presents and discusses Geiger's subtle and thoroughly sociological account of crowds and their revolutionary character. This includes an outlook to his theory of differentiation and to his critique of communitarian pathos in modern society. Second, the article demonstrates that Geiger's theory has much to offer contemporary debates on revolution. This is shown more specifically by contrasting Geiger's theory with Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's recent work. According to Hardt and Negri, the present imperial world order may be radically transformed by a new revolutionary subject, the multitude. The article contends that in many respects Geiger's theory provides a more complex picture of the possibility of revolution.

AB This short biography sketches the professional itinerary of Professor Dag Osterberg (1938-), a colleague very well known, respected and much quoted in his native Norway, as well as on the Nordic scene and beyond, as a sociologist, philosopher and musicologist. Osterberg's academic career spans the years as a student from 1957, magister 1961, doctorate 1973, and employment as assistant, associate and professor (in 1981). During several decades of not being employed he devoted his time to free study and writing. In practising a 'frugal freedom', he maintained his independence as an intellectual, upholding his original programme as a 'critic of society' and of sociology as a whole. The biography is written along Bourdieuvian lines, in seeking to understand his career through the various fields he has passed through. Unlike many others, he has had the boldness of spirit to withdraw, time and again, from situations and fields that did not fit with his programme. A critical spirit, he was one of the initiators of the local Norwegian Positivismusstreit, and, although in changing form, has maintained like stands ever since a critical, interpretive sociology, 'post-positivism'. The best known of his English books is Metasociology (1987).

AB The enforcement of family law is a significant actor in the welfare state's regulation of the domestic sphere. This article analyses how the child and different conceptions about children's welfare become constructed through the legal proceedings and decisions when divorced or separated parents have disputes over contact with their children: who is allowed to speak during the proceedings and which arguments about what is best for the child are considered as valid? The empirical basis for the analysis consists of 75 complicated disputes over child contact which were handled by the judicial authority in Denmark. The analysis deals with the key actors in the field and identifies several constructions about the child and 'the child's best interest'. The dominant rationale was elaborated on the basis of the judicial discourse and its professionals: this discourse is based on a limited-content definition of 'what is best for the child' and has the purpose of maintaining the idea of a normalized parenthood. The consequences of this construction for the involved children are discussed.

DE Bourdieu; cultural capital; economic capital; migration; rural; social
   class; urban
ID ATTAINMENT; COMMUNITY; MOBILITY
AB Depopulation is considered a problem for rural societies because it depletes the countryside of human capital and symbolizes the decay of the rural. In this article, however, rural-to-urban migration is analysed from the perspective of the rural migrants rather than from that of the rural societies: Does rural-to-urban migration represent a problem for the individual migrants in terms of the long-term effects of migration? This research question is addressed by assessing rural migrants' long-term achievement in terms of economic and cultural capital compared to rural non-migrants. The longitudinal approach is made possible by analysis of microlevel data from Norwegian censuses and the National Migration Register. The links between geographical and social mobility for the entire Norwegian rural birth cohort of 1965 (n = 9081) during a time-span of 30 years are then traced. Previous research has produced mixed results regarding the long-term effects of migration, which seemingly depend on data sources, methods and the national context of the respective studies. This article suggests that migrants from rural areas in Norway on average gain higher economic and cultural capital resources than non-migrants. However, these rewards of rural-to-urban migration differ substantially between migrants from different factions in the rural class structure.

DT Article
DE Finland; homicide; social stratification
ID SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; CRIME; INEQUALITY; MORTALITY; VIOLENCE
AB This article examines the social composition of homicide offenders and victims in Finland between 1960 and 2000. While many prior analyses have been based on victim-based cause-of-death statistics or aggregated rates of geographical units, the present data allowed the analysis of offender and victim populations at individual level. Both the rates and patterns of homicidal behaviour were analysed from the point of view of participants' social characteristics. It was discovered that the social anchoring of homicide remained stable in the relative sense that the typical victims and offenders were males from the lowest stratum. However, the absolute societal position of the lowest stratum male transformed as he was made economically redundant, a change that was reflected in homicide populations. The article concludes with a discussion of the paradox between the rise of the welfare state and the expected but unrealized pacification of the lowest stratum male. Four suppressing mechanisms are suggested: alcohol availability, social selection effects, cultural factors and the unintended consequences of social policy measures. The last category refers to changes in social patterns of homicide, which made the reduction of homicide rates more difficult, meaning that the present homicide situation is particularly resistant to efforts of situational crime prevention.

DE adolescence; class; gender; longitudinal; sociology; structural

ID UNEMPLOYMENT; SWEDEN
AB The questions addressed in this study are: first, what factors determine the economic situation among the young, and, second, what aspects in youth have a long-term impact on their economic situation as adults? The empirical analysis builds on a three-wave panel covering a period of 16 years. Growth curve modelling is used to estimate changes over time. The main results are: Young people's incomes say little about their current standard of living or future earnings ability. Economic deprivation during youth is unrelated to the development of deprivation over time. Hence, the finding that young people in general face economic difficulties does not mean a problem with lasting implications. Labour market situation and household characteristics during youth are relativelyl unrelated to development later in life. However, long-term unemployment hampers young people's economy in the long run. Most importantly, the results of this analysis emphasize the importance of the reproduction of class and gender relations. It is these two fundamental aspects, more than anything else, that affect young people on their way into adulthood and in their future life as adults.

AB The educational system is assumed to facilitate our full participation in society by laying the foundation for participatory rights and possibilities and at the same time strengthening civil society by fostering its individuals into democratic citizens. The question is what the future may bring if continuous economic cutbacks in the educational system lead to diminishing resources for the teaching of values of liberal democracy and multiculturalism. I try to answer this question by focusing on how xenophobia among Swedish teenage school adolescents is related to other values in the democratic system. The empirical data are drawn from a national sample comprising more than 6000 adolescents between 14 and 15 years of age. I conclude that willingness to participate actively in the democratic process through both political participation and other legal action relates negatively to xenophobia, whereas willingness to undertake acts of civil disobedience and mistrust in the political institutions relate positively to xenophobia. These findings raise the question of what the educational system should focus on in trying to combat racism and xenophobia and of what will happen in the future in times of diminishing resources.

AB What we do when we get home is influenced by what we do at work. In this article I analyse the relationship between market work and domestic activities from the perspectives of economic theories of time use, i.e. the work-leisure model (compares income work versus other activities) and the household production model (compares income work and household work), and sociological theory treating the issue of how leisure activities compensate for work strains. The empirical analysis of time use is based on the Norwegian time-use survey from 2000-2001. Estimates on working conditions are based on the Norwegian level of living surveys from 1996 and 2000 for 100 occupations found in both surveys. The analyses indicate that both physical strains and low autonomy at the place of employment lead to an allocation of time away from paid work towards unpaid work and leisure, but with considerable differences for men and women. The findings indicate that working conditions are part of the trade-off between paid and unpaid work, and that leisure activities may compensate for human needs being neglected in the workplace.

AB The primary goal of this article is to examine the impact of credential inflation on educational attainment in twentieth-century United States. To do so, we create a measure of 'intergenerational credential inflation' (intergeneration inflation factor) and include it in regression models predicting educational transitions. Using the General Social Surveys of 1972-2000, we find that people are generally less likely to invest in schooling if its value is relatively low. An exception is the final transition to a postgraduate degree, where we find that when its value is low children of parents with postgraduate education are more likely to take it. This finding supports relative risk aversion theory, which assumes that the main goal of children is to avoid downward social class mobility. Perhaps most important, we find that credential inflation is particularly influential on transition probabilities if parents had made the same transition. This pattern is consistent with the information differential thesis that children are more informed about the value of education if their parents acquired it.

AB The purpose of this article is to follow the development of the Swedish gender earnings gap through the 1980s and 1990s. We follow the changes in the wage gap and in factors to which it can be related year-by-year by analysing cross-sectional data from Statistics Sweden (HEK) for the years 1981 and 1983-98. The results show that the unadjusted wage gap varied between 12 and 15 per cent of the average male wage up to 1989, when the differentials began to increase. During the 1990s the size of the gap was around 14-18 per cent. In a decomposition analysis we find that the measured differences in jobs and qualifications between women and men can account only for between two-fifths and three-fifths of the gender wage gap, if they are assumed to be rewarded according to the male wage function. If the female wage function is applied, even less of the differentials are explained. Differences in the educational requirements for jobs have contributed considerably to gender earnings inequality. The impact has decreased over the period studied, however, and is about half as large in the 1990s as it was in the 1980s.

AB In this article, we argue that Alain Touraine's method of intervention is a way of conducting sociological analysis of collective action and social change, but that it must be developed in different ways. We place the intervention method within the context of Touraine's works on social movements and offer a detailed account. Drawing on the works of Pierre Bourdieu and Alberto Melucci we provide the basis for critically engaging with the method. We explore the methodological rules and procedures and the role of the researcher, and suggest a relatively more open understanding of the method.

DT Article
DE anti-foundationalism; genealogy method; philosophy of social science;
   pragmatism; Rorty
AB The article reflects on the possibility of a social science that aims at self-referential knowledge-acquisition. This form of social research explores and questions deep-seated presuppositions prevalent in contemporary culture and strives to become aware of other forms of life. This view of social sciences, therefore, is perfectly in line with the pragmatist perspective that language and knowledge, rather than acts of representation, allow people to increase the scope of human possibilities. Various forms of social research, in a wide range of disciplines, have already explored this self-referential knowledge: for instance, genealogical history and sociology, post-processual archaeology and the critical turn in anthropology. The article locates this self-referential knowledge within the context of contemporary American pragmatism (e.g. Rorty, Bernstein). It is argued that this type of knowledge ties in with the radical tradition in neo-pragmatism, in particular its anti-foundationalist notion of critique.

ID 3RD WAVE; SCIENCE
AB Today, two trends in European societies are often referred to as being strong and growing. The first is about centralization, i.e. governmental use of scientific recommendations as a universal tool guiding policy and advising citizens on how to behave. The second is about increasing self-reliance among ordinary citizens who claim personal-autonomy while contesting central state power decisions and universally framed scientific advice. Both these trends concern public involvement in decision-making about technical issues, but also comprise a possible paradox. The European Union (EU) characterizes this as being a growing conflict. In the article, the conflict is analyzed in a case study on air quality initiatives in the city of Gothenburg, part of the aim being to create integrative and standardized European air quality. The ways in which the city applies the EU Air Quality Framework Directive for local implementation are studied, and the question is raised of what local involvement is needed for the city to successfully implement the directive. By studying how policy-makers try to define future traveling behavior in order to support an air policy action plan, three different configurations of the agency of the urban traveler are found. The most neglected of these is found to be the one most important for closing the gap in the conflict mentioned above.

AB The Danish Board of Technology is famous for its work with citizen participation and consensus conferences. This article is based on an empirical investigation of a citizen project on electronic patient records. It investigates the concrete, situated interactions through which the production of a consensus took place. According to the Board of Technology, the democratic relevance of this citizen perspective is validated by their consensus-creating methods. In contrast with this suggestion, the article proposes to view citizen projects as risky, experimental encounters. This view suggests that consensus methods cannot guarantee that learning will occur and that a relevant democratic outcome will be reached. This viewpoint also allows the formulation of specific challenges for citizen projects as currently conceived.

ID SCIENCE
AB The new interest in staging public engagements with science, and the biosciences in particular, has been widely associated with a 'democratic turn' in the public understanding of science movement. This article seeks to bring this association under closer scrutiny by focusing on the development of public engagement with biotechnology in Sweden. It analyses the production and dramatic composition of a two-part film documentary entitled Life at Stake, financed by the Swedish research community and broadcast on public service television. Particular attention is paid to the actions of the new non-profit organization Scientists Meet Film-Makers, and the crucial mediating role this organization played in creating the conditions of possibility for Life at Stake to be financed, produced and broadcast. In conclusion, rather than supporting a new logic of deliberation, Life at Stake is discussed as more concerned with symbolization and spectacle in its use of images of suffering and hope as the touchstone of truth about biotechnology in society. In this way, science communicators appear to be displaying a willingness to learn from the media practices of environmental organizations and other protest groups, who have long appreciated the importance of contesting symbolic codes and schemes of meaning in society.

AB Crying out for more science does not solve all problems; rather, it makes it easy to shrug off responsibility for them. This is rightly pointed out by the influential Norwegian philosopher Hans Skjervheim in his critique of positivist science. The critique of positivism in itself is to steer clear of problems that we all ought to be addressing. In confronting Skjervheim's critique of positivism with post-constructivism, this article deals with social science's circumvention of the nature-culture relationship.

AB Leaving home at a very young age, particularly when not in conjunction with attending school away from home, appears to have a variety of negative consequences for the trajectory of young adults into successful career patterns and stable families. In this article, we examine the relationship between childhood family structure and nest-leaving patterns in the Swedish context. To our knowledge, this has never been done before. Analyses show that individuals from disrupted childhood families leave their parental home earlier than other young adults. The present state of knowledge is extended with analyses of the impact of adding a stepparent and of family conflict, and we distinguish between young adults leaving home to enter a union, to attend school, or to form a household of their own.

AB This article examines economy and politics in Sweden from a network theoretical perspective. In Sweden, economic and political elites make up two distinct catnets that are largely separated from each other, although there are bridges between them. The article contributes to an understanding of what brokerage roles are at work within the institutional arrangements of corporatism and pluralism. For several decades Sweden was considered one of the prototypical examples of corporatism. Representative brokerage was common, and promoted a relatively high degree of system integration. However, Swedish corporatism has declined dramatically since the early 1990s. This article discusses the consequences for contacts between the economic and political catnets in Sweden, and how corporatism has affected the level of system integration and the creation of social capital. The article shows that the more pluralistic institutional settings that replaced corporatism have resulted in two simultaneous processes: one of fragmentation of the economic catnet, caused by a shift from interest organizations to singular corporations as the locus of contact with political decision-makers, and one of increased importance of professional lobbyists as brokers (of the liaison type).

ID INEQUALITY; LEGITIMATION
AB Although evaluation of income inequality has been the subject of many studies, there are questions that remain to be answered. In regard to the structural position thesis, the reflection thesis and dominant ideology thesis, this article examines how much income inequality people will accept before deciding that the disparity is too large and how societal differences can be explained adequately. For this purpose, the attitudes of about 35,000 respondents in 30 countries are investigated. A multi-level analysis is carried out using data from the ISSP survey 'Social Inequality III' of 1999. At the societal level, both socio-economic and cultural characteristics are considered. While much research places emphasis on dominant ideologies, this analysis in addition attempts to grasp these ideologies by aggregating individual beliefs. It is shown that societal differences are well explained by ideologies, but that socio-economic characteristics are important as well. At the micro-level, several individual characteristics are considered. Among other things, people at the top of the vertical axis are less critical than those at the bottom. There are also substantial differences between societies in regard to how much inequality in income ratio will be accepted. Thus, people not only accept different amounts of income, they even have different preferences about which ratio is just.

AB Niklas Luhmann's theory of power is based on two fundamental pillars. First, he analyzes power functionally as a symbolically generalized medium of communication, which endows his conception of power with a strong evolutionary foundation. Second, he claims that power is constitutively tied to negative sanctions. Drawing upon Michel Foucault's analytics of power, the article is a critical examination of Luhmann's theory of power. In particular, Foucault's critique of the so-called discourse of sovereignty is transformed into an immanent critique of the second pillar in Luhmann's theory of power. The argument is that this pillar is converse to Luhmann's evolutionary theoretical objectives, as it reinstalls an Old-European semantics of power. The article contends that systems theory would better redeem its historical goals if it focused primarily upon the functional dimension of power. It is argued that this conceptual revision endows systems theory with a more flexible perspective on power that is both attentive to historical transformations of how power is exercised, and which still carries a strong link to a general theory of society and its evolution. In the article, this openness is demonstrated through a systemic reconstruction of Foucault's notion of subjectification which, in its Luhmannian version, is coined semantic intrusion.

AB This article uses a theoretical framework derived from migration studies to examine different understandings of migration and national belonging in the debate preceding Sweden's full legal acceptance of dual citizenship in 2001. The empirical question concerns the place of nationally versus transnationally oriented conceptions of migration in the debate, and the analysis of a wide range of public documents demonstrates that both kinds of conceptions were present. Opponents of dual citizenship generally gave expression to a national understanding and considered migration a temporary deviation from a normality of undivided national belonging. Some proponents of dual citizenship, on the contrary, held a more transnational view of migration, and regarded mobility and the maintenance of dual or multiple national bonds as normal. However, there were also many proponents who, from a national perspective, treated migration as more or less problematic, but still advocated dual citizenship as a tool for reducing some of the individual and social problems that it brought about.

AB The high unemployment figures in many European countries are often attributed to overgenerous unemployment benefits. However, proponents of benefit cuts tend not to recognize that unemployment benefits also facilitate longer job searches and, as a result, ultimately improve job matches. In this article, we investigate the effects of unemployment benefits on subsequent job quality by differentiating between transitions from unemployment to correctly allocated jobs and to over-education. Data are drawn from the West German Life History Study (GLHS). Results from Kaplan-Meier estimators and hazard regression models show that non-recipients of unemployment benefits indeed have a shorter unemployment duration, but that they also have significantly higher rates of transition to over-education than recipients of unemployment benefits. On the other hand, the receipt of unemployment benefits does not influence the transition to qualified jobs, which seems to be influenced more by labour demand. It is therefore important to bear in mind that reforming the unemployment compensation system by reducing unemployment benefits will not only shorten the average unemployment duration, but also increase the incidence of over-education and consequently reduce the overall job match quality in the labour market.

AB The proportion of women who withdraw from paid employment when they have children differs considerably among the countries of the European Union (EU), and the variation has mostly been attributed to institutional factors. In this study, we reassess the institutional explanation, because earlier supportive evidence is threatened by two alternative macro-level explanations: the influence of the economic necessity to work and the influence of gender role values in society. Our main research question is whether and to what extent these alternative explanations alter the effect of public childcare arrangements on mothers' labour supply Using panel data from 13 countries of the EU, we find evidence in favour of the institutional and economic explanations. In countries with more generous provision of public childcare and in countries with a lower level of economic welfare, the impact of childbirth on female labour supply is less negative than in other countries. Economic welfare appears to suppress rather than rival the institutional effect. More egalitarian gender role values in a country increase mothers' labour supply, yet these values do not alter the institutional effect. Our results underpin the importance of publicly supported arrangements for enhancing female labour supply.

AB Earlier research indicates clear gaps in wages and wage mobility between social classes. However, it has been argued that classes may be in the process of dissolving. Using Swedish cross-sectional and panel data, the following conclusions are drawn. The mismatch between class and economic reward increased in the last quarter of the 20th century, i.e. the data show a growing proportion of people whose wages are similar to those in other classes despite diverging mean differences in wages classes in the 1990s. Two processes are detected explaining this development: (1) changing age effects in the working class and (2) a dramatically widening sector cleavage within the service class. It is argued that these processes have implications for two of the main tasks of class analysis, i.e. assessing the development of inequality of opportunity and using class as an explanatory factor.
