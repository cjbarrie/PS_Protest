DE care-giving work; discourse; home-helper; justice; Nordic welfare state;
   professionalization; recognition; redistribution
AB The Nordic model is often seen as having succeeded in gaining recognition for care-giving work and as embodying a potentially women friendly state model owing to the availability of publicly provided care for the elderly and pre-school children. This simple story neglects one particular group of women publicly employed home-helpers and the valorization of their care-giving work. Applying Nancy Fraser's dual theory of justice gives us a normative and analytical tool with which to analyse this group's situation in relation to recognition and redistribution. Some advances concerning pay and in the professionalization of the home-helper's work have taken place. These advances hide less flattering developments, such as a general egalitarianism (on pay) insensitive to gendered valorizations, an androcentric perception of work and work-related accidents formerly at play and a New Public Management inspired elite discourse struggling to reduce the home-helper's work to simple, manual tasks in a discourse of de-professionalization. Overlapping of struggles about redistribution and recognition show that the positive changes identified are merely superficial, since no basic change of the socio-cultural framework has taken place that provides an impetus for future struggles.

   pathologies; Emmanuel Renault; Jean-Pierre Le Goff; neo-liberalism;
   recognition
AB The article deals with the relationship between work and recognition, taking Axel Honneth's social-philosophical theory of the struggle for recognition as its point of departure. In order to give sociological substance to Honneth's theory, we turn to three contemporary social theorists - Jean-Pierre Le Goff, Christophe Dejours and Emmanuel Renault. In spite of many differences, their work is united by a critical description of the logic of work and its consequences for individual individuation. These theorists agree that the growth of autonomy, flexibility and mobility has destabilised individual and collective identity formation and has led to an increase in social pathological illnesses such as stress and depression. By juxtaposing these analyses with Honneth's theory on recognition, we conclude that the contemporary logic of work is unable to provide adequate forms of recognition. Individuals are seemingly caught up in a continual battle for recognition without ever having the possibility of receiving proper respect.

TI Recognition and justice - Outline of a plural theory of justice
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
DE dignity; justice; recognition; redistribution; self-realization
AB In this article, Axel Honneth outlines a plural theory of justice. In developing his argument he takes his departure not in the classic elimination of 'inequality', but in the avoidance of 'humiliation' or 'disrespect'. He is convinced that an appropriate point of departure for a recognition-theoretical conception of justice must show that the experience of social injustice is always measured in terms of the withholding of some recognition held to be legitimate. Throughout the article, Honneth makes strong reservations about Nancy Fraser's approach, where 'recognition' and 'redistribution' are separated into two conceptual totalities with the single goal of 'participatory equality'. On the contrary, he suggests having a more elaborate concept of identity formation, so that participating in the public realm means participating without shame, capable of unfurling his or her own personality's potential in an unforced manner and of thus developing a personal identity. From this standpoint Honneth points to three differentiated spheres of recognition that must be obtained if the individual is to obtain a personal identity, namely love, equal treatment in law and social esteem.

DE Nordic research; recognition; redistribution; sociology of work
AB Recognition denotes a basic medium of social integration. It provides an answer to the question: What holds a society together? Recognition is also crucial to the process of socialization and identity formation. In order to develop a personal identity an individual is dependent upon recognition from different concrete and generalized others. This review essay focuses on the debate between Nancy Fraser and Axel Honneth, published recently under the title Redistribution or Recognition? A Political-Philosophical Exchange (2003). Then the theme of recognition is discussed in relation to the sociology of work, taking as a point of departure a collection of articles published under the title Anerkennung und Arbeit (2000). Finally, attention is drawn to some recent contributions from Nordic scholars, mainly within the disciplines of social philosophy and sociology, to the theme of recognition.

AB This paper explores the research methodology of Gunnar Myrdal's study of race relations in the United States, An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy (1944). It gives an overview of the methodological framework it presents for the study of racism and its consequences. The interpretative paradigm that underpinned this forcefully anti-racist synthesis of a large amount of empirical evidence is discussed, and three core elements of the normative theoretical framework are highlighted: the role of human rights values in theory and practice, the concept of 'social environmentalism' and the principle of 'cumulative causation'. Examples are then given of quantitative and qualitative evidence in support of the overall arguments about racism and its consequences. The paper concludes by noting that Myrdal's explicit value perspective, coupled with detailed empirical attention to the causal institutional effects of racism as a belief system, is a research tradition worthy of continued attention.

DE behavioral change; compositional change; domestic outsourcing trends
ID SERVICE ECONOMY; DIVISION; WIVES; LABOR; TIME
AB Changes in the composition of households - especially the growing number of dual earners and singles - are often assumed to be associated with an increase in domestic outsourcing. In this article, trends in the outsourcing of household tasks (employing a domestic help and eating out) and the use of child daycare are analyzed with Dutch data (TBO 1980-2000, AVO 1983-1999). As it turns out, the observed increase over the past few decades in the outsourcing of household tasks can be explained by compositional changes. The supply of outsourcing services has not always grown accordingly. Trends in outsourcing are more than the total sum of individual demand factors. An example is the use of domestic help, which shows a net decrease. Our findings suggest that own domestic production has become more efficient, which has led to a reduction in the demand for outsourcing. The increase in the use of daycare for children can be explained as a general behavioral change, indicative of a shift in societal values concerning childcare. Parents are more inclined to hire childcare, irrespective of their personal characteristics. No systematic evidence was found for micro-level behavioral changes in outsourcing.

AB A potential self-reinforcing component in the dynamics of social assistance (SA) is analyzed in this paper. The core hypothesis is that the SA recipiency of others can assert a positive influence on an individual's propensity to apply for SA. The mechanisms through which such influence may operate are discussed and a set of hypotheses linking individual action and macro-level SA are proposed and tested by means of pooled cross-sections time-series analysis. Data on all individuals aged 20-25 in the Stockholm region who received SA in the years 1990-9 are used for the analyses. Results indicate that the level of SA in one year has a positive effect on the next year's inflow of new SA recipients and a negative effect on the outflow, even when other relevant factors are controlled for. This lends support to the hypothesis of a self-reinforcing process.

AB Time and again, studies have shown that higher educated individuals are less inclined to avoid social contact with ethnic minorities than are lower educated individuals. This has been interpreted as the liberalizing effect of education: the school is considered to be the most important socializing agent transmitting liberal values that reduce ethnic intolerance and ethnic prejudice. However, parents too are considered to be important socializing agents. We set out to compare the effects of educational attainment with various kinds of parental influence. We analysed data on 201 young adults and their parents from a Dutch panel study The results show that the relative influence of parents is fairly small compared to the effect of education. Moreover, controlling for parental influences hardly reduces young adults' educational effect on ethnic distance: education is (still) the most important determinant for young adults' ethnic distance.

AB This article demonstrates how Norwegian physiotherapy has developed as part of the state apparatus over the past decades. From the state's point of view, the methods and skills of physiotherapy are deemed valuable because they are designed to encourage people to take an active part in constructing and reconstructing their own health. From the physiotherapists' point of view, the state is an attractive ally in their seemingly endless struggle to escape from the shadow of medicine. The occupation was drawn into the public domain and given a wider mandate as part of a bio-political strategy. In return, it has experienced growth, gained nationwide representation, and obtained greater autonomy vis--vis the law. The case illustrates the larger issues of how modern welfare states expand and contribute to the regulation of complex societies.

AB In general, Western societies believe that people should engage in a multitude of social activities and develop multiple social roles. The assumption is that having multiple roles is beneficial to the individual. However, it also means that life is more complex and that people have to handle sometimes conflicting demands. Earlier research on the effects of multiple roles on individual well-being has not provided a clear picture, some results supporting the role stress theory and some the role expansion theory. This article tests empirically the relevance of the role stress theory and the role expansion theory by analysing whether having multiple social roles in general decreases or increases individual well-being. The results are based on a panel study of nearly 9000 randomly selected Swedes. The conclusion is that both number of social roles and any increase in social roles are negatively correlated with the risk of suffering from insomnia and a lingering illness, and the risk of being on regular medication for a lingering illness. These findings indicate that having multiple social roles increases individual well-being; the results therefore support the role expansion theory.

AB The issue of whether health influences mobility and status attainment has tended to be neglected in the main traditions of social mobility research. Health inequality research, however, indicates that health strongly affects transitions into and out of employment, but that the occupational mobility of the steadily employed is practically unaffected by health. This latter finding is surprising, because a plausible conjecture is that health variations influence occupational achievement also among those in continuous working careers. In this article I investigate the topic in a sample of Norwegian men born in 1946 who have been steadily employed over the course of three decades (n = 330). Using ordinary least squares regression, I analyse whether health is associated with subsequent changes in occupational prestige, managerial position and income change. The results indicate that health variations have no impact on occupational trajectories during young adulthood. After age 40, however, significant health effects are revealed in relation to attainment of managerial position and income change, but not to changes in occupational prestige. This suggests that occupational trajectories are health-selective to some extent even among men in continuous working careers, but that these tendencies first emerge in mid-life when health has become more differentiated, and health effects are constrained by how occupational careers are typically structured in present-day societies.

AB The widely held assumption that the welfare society model is superseding the welfare state model has restructured the common view of the future of social policy all around the world. This study brings local issues into focus with an investigation of the applicability of the welfare society model in the Scandinavian context. The study first examines the strength of the various welfare agents sector by sector to define the sectoral rationale, and second it seeks to reveal the system rationale of the Scandinavian welfare state by using the perspective of private-public interplay. The basic argument is that the public sector-led structure of welfare provision prevents non-public agents from realizing their full potential. The far-reaching institutional integration of the private and public spheres leaves little room for voluntary (welfare) agents to operate; the weak sense of reciprocality, combined with a strong notion of welfare right, still renders normative support for a system of state welfare. These conditions will surely vitiate the high hopes that some hold for the welfare society model in Scandinavia.

AB The aim of this article is to outline a theory cultural trauma, with reference to slavery and the formation of an African American identity. With this in mind, the concepts 'collective memory' and 'collective identity' are discussed and linked with a theory of intellectual generations. It is proposed that the notion of an 'African American' emerged as part of the efforts of a generation of black intellectuals to come to grips with their, individual and collective, rejection by American society after being promised full integration following the end of the Civil War (1861-5). Slavery, not so much as experience, but as a form of memory, was a focal point of reference in this process.

TI Review essay liquid modernity - Bauman on contemporary welfare society
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Review
DE postmodernity; poverty; social policy; space; welfare state
AB In the sociology of Zygmunt Bauman, contemporary society, labelled consumer society by Bauman, is viewed as liquid modernity, which underlines mobility as indicative of our time. Globalization encapsulates the increasing mobility of capital and social elites; Bauman stresses that the present consumer society is stratified, and for the poor mobility is not an easy option. Spatial differentiation goes hand in hand with social differentiation. Increasingly, the affluent segments isolate themselves in voluntary ghettos such as gated communities, while the poor are relegated to the enforced ghetto, where they are labelled an underclass and viewed as useless and unwanted. Bauman demonstrates the development in North America as indicative of the situation elsewhere, but suggests an alternative to neo-liberal welfare state dismantling: namely the introduction of a basic income and substitution of the work ethic by an ethic of craftsmanship.

AB Fighting among adolescents was tested for association with alcohol/drug use and out-of-home activities without adult control (such as 'hanging out' on the streets). A survey was used to collect data from the majority of 13 to 15-year-olds in a Norwegian town (N>1400). Structural equation modelling resulted in a high regression weight for the latent variable of participation in out-of-home activities (beta=0.54), supporting routine activities theory, and only a moderate regression weight for the latent variable of alcohol consumption (beta=0.19). An assumption that the two exogenous variables would demonstrate an interaction effect was not supported by the data. However, subgroup analyses suggested that routine activities theory should not be applied to the exclusion of subcultural theories. As one might expect, differences between boys' and girls' experience of fighting could only partially be explained by the variables investigated. More significant, however, was that participation in the out-of-home activities investigated appeared not to be associated with fighting among girls from non-Western immigrant groups-a finding that questions routine activities theory. The article concludes that routine activities theory has merits as far as the investigation of general tendencies in delinquent behaviour is concerned, but it should not replace investigations of subcultural differences.

DT Article
DE inequality; measurement; social welfare; relative deprivation; reference
   group
ID INCOME; DECOMPOSITION
AB Although concerns for inequality are at the heart of the sociological tradition, few sociologists have taken a serious interest in the normative and methodological issues involved in the choice between different measures of inequality. It is argued in this article that the widely used but also widely criticized Gini index can be seen to incorporate a particularly sociological conception of inequality. The Gini index has features that are alien to mainstream welfare economics, but perfectly sensible if inequality is understood more sociologically as arising from a state of relative deprivation. However, the commitment to a relativistic conception of inequality leads to serious theoretical and practical complications. The implicit rationale of the Gini index assumes that it is applied to a 'reference population'-where everybody compares themselves with everybody else. It is not obvious that the residents of a nation-state always constitute a reference population in this sense, and arguments can be found both for widening and narrowing the scope of the relevant population. Both aggregation and disaggregation from whatever is considered to be the 'appropriate' scope of the reference population is problematic and requires different methodological solutions.

ID COHABITATION
AB Higher proportions of births outside marriage and more family breakdown indicate that children experience increased diversity of family circumstances at birth and during childhood. While England/Wales and Norway have many similar features, there are distinct differences in social and welfare policies. This article compares children's experiences in the two countries in relation to these policies. Emphasis is put particularly on the impact of consensual unions. Children are the statistical unit and data from surveys and national statistics are compared. In both countries there is considerable risk of family dissolution in the case of children born into consensual unions, but the more so in England/Wales than in Norway. Even though the rate of extramarital births is much higher in Norway than in England/Wales, the corresponding rate of family change is lower. The article suggests that behind parental break-up lies an old pattern of social stratification masked as family change.

DE emergence of liberal democracy; critique of path-dependency theories;

AB In taking a statist perspective inspired by Hegel, Clausewitz and C. Schmitt this article provides an analysis of the period from the early seventeenth century to the mid-nineteenth century, when Denmark evolved towards a liberal-democratic state based on a written constitution. It is argued that Denmark became a democracy as an unintended consequence of military reforms. Whereas most analyses on state formation in early modern Europe contain some form of path dependency, this work argues that the Danish case clearly demonstrates that no path dependency model can in any satisfying sense explain the two crucial years in the formation and change of the Danish state, 1660 (the introduction of the Absolutist rule) and 1849 (the introduction of the liberal-democratic constitution). Consequently, the Danish development challenges commonly held views of state formation processes in Europe.

AB Scholars and policy-makers increasingly treat occupational sex segregation as a generic indicator of female economic disadvantage. This view is difficult to reconcile with evidence that levels of sex segregation are lower in reputably 'gender-traditional' countries such as Italy, Japan. and Portugal than in 'progressive' Sweden and the United States. Understanding such seemingly anomalous patterns requires a two-dimensional conceptualization of occupational sex segregation - in particular. an analytical distinction between vertical and horizontal gender inequalities. Based on data from 10 industrialized countries, claims regarding (1) the hybrid nature of sex segregation and (2) the cultural and structural factors that influence its various components arc empirically assessed. Results confirm that unequal distributions across the manual-non-manual divide ('horizontal segregation') and status differentials within these sectors ('vertical segregation') together account for a considerable share of occupational gender inequality. Gender-egalitarian cultural norms are associated with lower levels of vertical segregation in the non-manual sector, while postindustrial economic structures coincide with greater horizontal segregation (and more vertical segregation of non-manual occupations). The complex horizontal and vertical dynamics revealed here cast further doubt on unidimensional conceptualizations of sex segregation. They also provide the key for deciphering some long-standing empirical puzzles in the field.

AB Grid-group theory claims that patterns of social relations only, and not socio-demographic characteristics. can account for biases, of which the theory prescribes four: hierarchy, egalitarianism, individualism and fatalism. Survey analysts conventionally employ respondents' socio-demographic correlates when accounting for values. We take the value survey strategy and apply it to grid-group theory's four biases. Employing a 1999 survey administered in Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland (n = 4,832), we combine two goals in this article. We test how sex, age, education and income can account for biases. By extension, we test grid-group theory's claim of no such effect. The results show that biases are influenced by socio-demographics in ways unaccounted for by the theory The four correlates explain on average 9 per cent of the variation in the biases. Education is the only correlate that has a negative and significant effect across all biases in all countries. Women adhere to egalitarianism, whereas men adhere to individualism. Age is a consistent positive correlate of hierarchy. whereas income is a consistent negative correlate of fatalism. Grid-group theory will not be impaired if it can be shown how robust socio-demographic correlates interact with patterns of social relations.

ID GROWTH
AB The thesis of the article is that strong growth in the number of part-time jobs in The Netherlands between 1973 and 1991 negatively affected the tabour market participation of men, especially lower educated men. The thesis consists of a behavioural component, which explains why lower educated men are not attracted and do not gain access to part-time jobs, and an institutional component, which explains why the tabour market position of lower educated men in The Netherlands deteriorated relatively rapidly during the period 1973-91. The thesis is underpinned by an empirical analysis of tabour market participation of lower educated male workers in part-time and full-time jobs. Competing theses, such as upgrading of the job structure, displacement by better educated workers and sector shift from manufacturing to services, are tested empirically, but prove to be less convincing explanations for the deteriorated tabour market position of lower educated men than the explanation of the growth of part-time jobs.

AB This study proposes a typology of adolescents' social justice judgments (SJJs) as assessed by their attribution of importance to various distribution rules representing two generic principles of justice (egalitarian and equitarian). Four basic styles of SJJ are identified: I. Ecumenical (emphasis on both egalitarian and equitarian justice); II. Pure Egalitarian (emphasis on egalitarian justice); III. Pure Equitarian (emphasis on equity rules); and IV Withdrawn (emphasis on neither). This proposed typology is empirically supported by POSAC (Partial-Order Scalogram Analysis with base Coordinates), which is used to analyse SJJs among adolescents in Israeli and East German samples. The typology is also found useful in discriminating between adolescents in these two countries: the proportion of the Ecumenical and Pure Egalitarian styles is higher among East Germans than among Israelis. while the proportion of the Pure Equitarian and Withdrawn styles is higher among Israelis.

AB It has been suggested in several studies that marriage provides the best framework for a sexual relationship. During the past few decades, however, the majority of young singles have maintained a partnered sex life, and marriage has given way to cohabitation as the typical way for heterosexual couples to live together in young adulthood. Taking a longitudinal population-based sample of young Norwegian adults (n = 2695, age 20-26), we investigated the degree to which sexual satisfaction was associated with the type of relationship in which they were engaged. Among both males and females, the sexually active unattached were the least satisfied with their sex lives, and a committed and long-lasting relationship seemed to be of greater importance for women than for men. In these relationships, however, a decrease in sexual activity and sexual satisfaction was observed over time, suggesting that boredom and routine may rapidly decrease sexual satisfaction. Most striking was the finding that females seem to profit in their sexual relationships from traditionally feminine and masculine gender roles in the form of androgyny. Men, on the other hand, still seem to manoeuvre on the basis of less flexible gender roles.

AB The influences of female employment on working couples' class-based identities, preferences towards government redistribution, and choice of political party in Sweden, Germany, and the US are analysed in this article. Two issues are of interest. The first is the unit of class composition: families (conventional approach) versus individuals (individual approach). The results indicate that the conventional approach explains more of the variation in the dependent variables than does the individual approach. However, in many cases the inclusion of female employment within the class schema increases the explanatory power of social class significantly. The second issue is cross-country variation. Based on assumptions about the post-industrial economy, a hypothesis concerning cross-country variation in class-gender patterns is tested. In contrast to the hypothesis, the data show that female employment influences are greatest in Germany, closely followed by Sweden. In the US, influences of female employment on working couples' socio-political orientations are negligible.

DT Article
ID ACCOUNTS
AB The results from a study on homeless immigrants in Copenhagen are analysed in this article. Based on 25 life-history interviews with male immigrants living in institutions for the homeless, my focus of concern is the interviewees' self-presentations and their attempts to handle their stigmatized position. Two theoretical approaches are combined. First, the narratives are analysed as representations of the immigrants' marginalized status in their new society. Many narratives echo Bauman's (1991) descriptions of the stranger as someone constructed as a 'permanent other'; someone discredited, blamed and discriminated against because he/she 'threatens the natural order of things'. Second, the narratives are analysed as presentations, i.e. as the narrators' preferred interpretations of their present and past situations (Scott and Lyman, 1968). The narratives are therefore read not just as reflections of 'things that actually happened' to the interviewees. but also as reflections of their strategies in handling these incidents and of their attempts to present themselves in the interviews as persons 'permanently on trial', persons who are 'respectable after all'.

The analysis focuses on the main actors involved in the production and reproduction of the segmented labour market their specific political and economic interests, and the changing institutional mechanisms employed by the state to constitute these populations as cheap and unprotected labour. The analysis shows that beyond the state's and employers' interests directly related to the functioning of the labour market, the varying conditions in the national conflict between Israel and the Palestinians and the changing strategies employed by the Israeli state to manage this conflict have fundamentally affected the dynamics of the segmented labour market. The study sheds light on the complex interplay between political and economic forces in the constitution of subordinate populations as cheap and unprotected labour, showing that fluid political settings related to state-building processes and the state's autonomous interests deriving from these processes, as well as the distinct political status of different subordinate populations, are factors as important as the employers' demand for cheap labour.

ID GLOBALIZATION; SOCIOLOGY
AB Our changing times provide numerous opportunities for interesting research into different aspect of the knowledge-based society. Science is becoming a powerful institution influencing people's daily lives in various ways. But it is also increasingly influenced by social, economic and political forces shaping its direction and controlling its applications. The boundaries between private and public, nature and society, are increasingly challenged by scientific and technical advances. Technological products or tools embody knowledge and mediate it at the same time. Creating and disseminating knowledge by means of such tools is problematic in many ways, although the tools tend to be taken for granted as objective and neutral. The status and authority of experts in the knowledge-based society is neither automatic nor self-evident. The maintenance of expert status and control requires legitimation and validation displays to fight off public disinterest and scepticism, or legal challenge. Despite the importance of science and technology, mundane and tacit forms of knowledge are still crucial. The implications of recent scientific and technological developments for public welfare seem to indicate that the knowledge society and the welfare state can coexist in a mutually supportive relationship.

AB Based on ethnographic research at the National Weather Service and at a large firm of architects in Chicago, we explore the role of technology in mediating knowledge. We consider meteorological databases and computer-aided design systems as tools that standardize and provide access to knowledge, making information transferable across organizational contexts. However, knowledge is always situated and grounded in practice. These tools, even as they standardize, create possibilities for generating and codifying knowledge that is locally meaningful, potentially giving rise to communication problems. Technology is appropriated as part of the local culture, even as it transforms that culture, altering the meaning of knowledge and the nature of creativity at work.

AB This article has a triple aim: (1) it explores how the stunning advance of modern bioscience is affecting the social world, and how once-set boundaries are now being quickly transgressed; (2) it is suggested that the theoretical divides between modernists and post-modernists can be fruitfully viewed, from a sociology of knowledge perspective, as traces of a much more profound and ongoing evolutionary discourse now also affecting the social and the human sciences; (3) concerns are expressed regarding the destabilization of both the natural and the social world alike as a consequence of bioscience: the long-term social effects of the emphasis on individual choice, as presently argued, will eventually erode the system of collective responsibility altogether.

ID TRENDS
AB The Scandinavian countries - Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland - have developed a particular model of welfare, employment and economic governance. It is based on universal access to tax-financed social services and social insurance, full employment secured by expansive macro-economic policies and active labour market policies, highly organized labour markets, corporatist interest mediation, and so on. This article surveys the response of the Scandinavian socio-economic model to the challenges of economic globalization and the rise of a knowledge-based economy. It has repeatedly been stated that this changing economic model 'requires' labour market deregulations, tax cuts and privatizations of public services. The experience of the Scandinavian countries in the 1990s indicates that it is possible to retain traditional commitments to employment and social security by developing active policies for industrial renewal and support of innovation systems, technological development, scientific infrastructures and regional concentrations of industrial competence.

AB This article examines the role of lay persons in the thinking and working of experts in different fields at the borders of academic knowledge production. The status of lay persons has been studied in the Public Understanding of Science (PUS) research, which has shed light on the implicit assumptions of the deficit model that experts usually apply to lay persons. This deficit model has been consistently criticized for its inadequacy. The purpose of this article is not to contribute to this critique but to focus on the conceptions of the expertise of lay persons as a necessary prerequisite of science-based recommendations in the context of application. We call such conceptions 'imagined lay persons' (ILP). We argue that such conceptions fulfil a functional purpose in the interaction between different fields in knowledge societies, and that such conceptions should not be checked against some alleged essential features of lay persons. Based on four different case studies of science centres, environmental science and consultations, as well as state regulations of genetically modified organisms, the authors examine the image of these imagined lay persons and what role they play in expertise.

Despite a reputation of having a strong Scandinavian rational choice tradition, rational choice sociology is practically non-existent in Denmark, Finland and Iceland. Rational choice sociology in Scandinavia is by-and-large concentrated in Oslo and Stockholm universities, where insightful discussions and relevant applications are found. but not in impressive numbers.

ID APPRENTICESHIP
AB The skills, qualifications and credentials generated by educational systems are strongly related to tabour market attainment. The centrality of the educational system for the structuring of individuals' life chances has generated a long-lived and intense debate around the proper design of educational systems. The purpose of this article is to examine whether vocational training provided within the educational system protects graduates against employment precariousness over the life course. The extent and character of vocational training are related here to the transition from school to work, the risk of unemployment once established on the labour market, and the likelihood of finding new employment if unemployed. The data used consist of life history data from Great Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden. The results suggest that the impact of vocational training on labour market precariousness changes over people's work career. Vocational training reduces precariousness during the transition from school to work, whereas there is no difference in the impact of general and vocational education on unemployment risk once established on the labour market. Instead, among those who do become unemployed there are indications that general education may be more beneficial.

DE actor network theory; agency; autopoiesis; consciousness; external
   scaffolding; intention; perception; phenomenology
AB A theory of the embodiment of action is proposed. Reflections on relations between human intentions, the human body and the notion of agency lead us to argue that phenomenological analysis is not sufficient for such a theory. Our consideration, that the most fundamental level of embodied agency is that of life itself, brings us to the philosophy of biology and the theory of the organism: briefly, certain parts of the natural environment are intrinsic to the constitution of organisms and, in their more sophisticated configuration, as agents. Action is embodied in the sense that certain physiological processes are internal in relation to it and play a constitutive role in its performance. The way in which environment, context and consciousness affect and constitute the nature of agency at personal and sub-personal levels is elaborated. We see that human agents perceive and act upon their world through a complex shifting between those levels. A summary of the ways in which the social sciences can be enriched by this more comprehensive view of human agency provides the basis of justification for claiming Actor-Network Theory (ANT), originally developed by sociologists studying science and technology, as a promising framework for the continuation of this reasoning.

AB To survive the economic trauma caused by the demise of the Soviet Block, the Cuban government enacted economic and social reforms that are causing hardships in the lives of Cubans. This article shows that a synthesis of the theories of Marx and Mead provides a useful perspective for understanding Cubans' critical reflections on daily encounters that contradict abstract revolutionary values. Existing sources and qualitative data show a complex interplay between the abstract values of equality, communalism and nationalism, which have been incorporated into definitions of self, and Cubans' efforts to meet their needs. The results presented suggest that Cubans' incorporation into the self of revolutionary attitudes contributes to their reluctance to reject and criticize the revolutionary regime. For Cubans, the formation and expression of critical responses to the existing social system are all the more difficult because of the striking absence of alternative ideologies.

ID EUROPE
AB Working time reduction is high on the political agenda of the European Union and its member states. In Dutch banks, reduced working time (RWT) was agreed in collective bargaining; however, employers are able to exclude employees from RWT A total of 82 per cent of employees were assigned RWT. Using large-scale survey data based on 17,308 employees, regression analyses were performed to investigate which employees had favourable RWT attitudes and which employees were assigned RWT With regard to employee attitudes, the maximizing income hypothesis was mostly supported. Low-income, breadwinning and part-time employees were less in favour of RWT. The maximizing non-working hours hypothesis is only partly supported. Female employees had more favourable attitudes to RWT, but this showed little correlation with the presence of young children. Supervisors had less favourable attitudes to RWT There was little support for the minimizing working hours hypothesis. Attitudes of employees in redundant jobs hardly differed from other employees, which is surprising given that RWT is aimed at work sharing. In explaining employers' strategies, this article shows that RWT was not assigned at random: its primary aim was to strengthen the banks' long-term transformation from administrative bureaucracies to commercial organizations. The banks did not seem to be aiming for a short-term increase in productivity as RWT was not assigned less frequently to insufficiently staffed departments or more frequently to employees in redundant jobs. Finally, the labour market hypothesis is barely supported. Only one bank assigned RWT less frequently to jobs that were in short supply.

TI Industrialization and Intergenerational mobility in Sweden
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL-MOBILITY; ENGLAND
AB The relationship between industrialization and intergenerational mobility has been a topic of discussion for over forty years. In this article both total mobility and relative mobility chances are studied in the decades preceding industrialization and the decades during industrialization. A high-quality data set is used covering the male population of a region in the north of Sweden during the 19th century. Total intergenerational mobility increased during industrialization until, at the end of the century, both industrialization and the growth of mobility stagnated. Sectorial barriers resulted in unequal relative mobility chances before and also during industrialization. However, sons from self-employed classes were less likely to inherit the class position of their father after the onset of industrialization. At the same time, mobility between classes differing in status became less frequent. These results show a decline in the importance of the direct transfer of resources between generations and may indicate the increasing importance of education.

TI Me - A consumer? Consumption, identities and lifestyles in today's
   Finland
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
ID STRATIFICATION; LOCATION; LEISURE
AB Recent sociological theories of consumption and lifestyles usually argue that consumption plays an essential role in the creation and maintenance of personal identities. For the consumers, the identity sustaining process operates through playing with the lifestyles that are fragmented, flexible and fluid. The consumers of the 'digital era' are argued to be unpredictable, individualistic, expressive and also highly competent in their spending patterns. This kind of approach is questionable. It is doubtful that people make a conscious decision to use consumption as a means of playing with identities. Economic restraints, social regulation, conventions, routines, socialization in peer groups are (still) likely to restrict the freedom of the consumer. In this study, the importance of consumption for identity-formation was examined empirically by analysing a data set derived from a lifestyle survey, 'Finland 1999'. The findings suggest that most Finnish consumers may not consciously consider consumption to be a major part of their identities. Although some materialist and hedonist lifestyles were found, many consumption styles were also characterized by modest and rational spending patterns. Saving money was important for most consumers, and many also underestimated their consumption. Socio-economic and demographic factors, particularly gender, age, class position and income had also a strong effect on consumption and lifestyles. Hence, on the basis of this data, most Finnish consumers seem rather 'ordinary' and not quite as individualistic as postmodern theories argue.

AB The past 15 years have witnessed a steep growth in world trade. Almost half of that growth is due to the increased integration of the European economics, The European Union's (EU) decisions to complete the single market and move towards a common currency have created a single set of rules governing economic activity in Europe. We argue that these changes imply a process of 'Europeanization' of Europe's economies, As a result, the largest European corporations have increasingly focused their investments across Europe and worked to gain market share within the EU. Our results imply that at least part of what we call globalization is the result of states' deciding to build rules for market integration in Europe. States continue to play an essential role in market building.

TI Social class and stratification in late modernity
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Social changes associated with late modernity have led many to question the continuing relevance of class analysis. This paper shows that, far from being dead. class remains an important analytical tool. This is shown in relation to the constitution of economic classes, the causal effects of class situations, the formation of social classes, and patterns of class awareness. It is argued that economic class divisions can still be identified and that they Continue to exercise a major impact on life chances. Nevertheless, class effects must be considered alongside other, partially offsetting, causal effects, and this means that patterns of social class formation are looser than in the past. People continue to recognise the existence of economic and social class divisions, but they arc likely to supplement this with other lifestyle factors in constituting their social identities.

AB The paper pays particular attention to gender- and age-linked differences in forms of indirect, relational and direct, physical forms of delinquent aggression, as well as to sequential links of these forms of delinquent aggression to depression and drug and alcohol abuse. A power-control theory of the gender-delinquency relationship that draws attention to differences in familial control practices is then linked to these variations in the expression of delinquency and despair. We extend the focus of power-control theory to address how parental agency and support for dominant attitudes or schemas influence involvement in different forms of delinquency and despair. This extension emphasizes that differences in structure, particularly between more and less patriarchal households, result in degrees of difference and of kind in non-normative outcomes. The paper concludes with a call for increased diversity in the measurement of delinquency and despair and for the development of opposite-sex sibling samples to explore gender- and age-linked differences in non-normative phenomena.

TI The emergence of a modern youth culture: The Swedish 1930s
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
AB This study traces the emergence of a modern youth culture in the 1930s in Sweden, thus challenging the view that it was born in the 1950s. Sweden, at that time. was a society at the crossroads: all over culture and society, modernity opposed what was given. The new youth culture is traced through a study of five popular cultural forms - boys' literature. particularly aviation books. girls' literature, sport, and national and US film. with a special focus on music looking particularly for its patterning in what is called the boundary and intensity dimensions, Thus, it is possible to demonstrate rich cultural resources for a modern youth culture. However, balancing this against still existing socioeconomic restrictions makes the picture more ambiguous. What is found is not a generalized modern youth culture, but its emergence. resonating in interesting ways with the new Folkhem (the People's Home).

TI Farm crisis, mobility and structural change in Swedish agriculture,

SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
AB This is a longitudinal study of structural change in Swedish agriculture during 1992 to 1999/ 2000, in which period the country entered the European Union and its agriculture went through a major economic crisis. The study is unique in drawing on a theoretically grounded typology to describe the agrarian structure and its dynamism. The results show that there has been a great deal of mobility of farming households in the agrarian structure during the period. As expected, the rate of closure has been high. It is remarkable, though, that despite the fluidity, the farm structure remains remarkably stable, but increasingly bimodal : it continues to be dominated economically by a relatively small stratum of family farms, while being numerically dominated by part-time farms and by pluriactive farmers.

TI Unemployment and gendered divisions of domestic labor
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
ID WORKERS
AB A certain level of gender inequality prevails in both families and societies, regardless of which countries are studied. This is, among other things, closely associated with the fact that women have the main responsibility for home and family. Here, I study whether unemployment is associated with alterations in the gendered division of domestic labor among Swedish men and women. Levels of domestic labor activity during periods of unemployment are explored, as well as the question of whether any associations persist after the individual re-enters employment. The data materials used are taken from the Swedish Longitudinal Study among the Unemployed, 1992-1993, as well as the Swedish Level of Living Survey from 1991. The results indicate that although gender is the best predictor of levels of domestic labor activity, labor market status also affects levels of domestic labor activity. In other words, women are more active than men, but the unemployed are more active compared with the employed. The hypothesis that male unemployment is associated with a more equal division of domestic labor is thus supported. For women, the hypothesis that unemployment is related to an exacerbated unequal division of domestic labor receives support, although it is questionable whether unemployment has any permanent effects on activity in domestic labor, since the re-employed decrease their domestic labor activity.

AB Intergroup attitudes in a Norwegian town were investigated based on a survey with 12 to 16 year-old adolescents. Members of the ethnic majority group (n > 1,100) and members of a minority group (ethnic Turks, n = 54) were studied. Two smaller immigrant groups (Pakistanis and Vietnamese) were used as additional attitude objects. The study demonstrated the expected association between outgroup friendships and more favourable outgroup attitudes. Explained variance of outgroup attitudes was limited among majority members, but was significantly higher among minority members. Boys among majority members demonstrated less favourable outgroup attitudes than those demonstrated by girls. However, they also revealed a higher association between contact and attitudes than girls did. The study was particularly interested in generalization effects across various outgroups. Although no common generalization effect was evident, the data indicated that friendships with members of one outgroup may be associated with either more positive or more negative attitudes towards another outgroup, dependent on the interrelations between the two outgroups. The study supported several hypotheses derived from the Contact Hypothesis, from Social Identity Theory, and from the Common Ingroup Identity Model. Still, it also demonstrated that intergroup relations in real world settings are more complex than laboratory experiments involving two groups can reflect. The data indicated that Muslim immigrant groups with different ethnic backgrounds might hold a common ingroup identity. At the same time, ethnic Norwegians demonstrated the least positive outgroup attitudes towards Muslim groups.

SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA

ID TIME-USE; FAMILY; GENDER; WORK; WOMEN; LABOR
AB Lately, in Norway, as in many other countries, there has been considerable focus on social inequalities among women. It seems that the level of education is of great significance for women's practices and ideals in many areas. Norwegian time-use studies from 1970, 1980 and 1990 were used to investigate whether level of education affects mothers' priorities regarding housework and childcare and how this changed during the 1970s and 1980s. Also discussed is how differences in terms of housework and childcare time should be assessed and evaluated. During the years in question, there was a clear tendency towards highly educated mothers spending less time on housework than mothers with a lower level of education, but the differences diminished somewhat during the period. In 1970, 1980 and 1990 there was a tendency for well-educated mothers to spend more time on active childcare than mothers with less education. Dissimilarities in this area were rather stable. Concerning total time spent with children, there were minor differences among mothers in relation to level of education in all three years investigated. Hence, it seems that well-educated mothers model their childcare somewhat differently from less-educated mothers in that they spend a larger proportion of their time with their children on active care. There are, then, similarities as well as dissimilarities between mothers in various educational groups regarding the way they shape their parental role, and in the 1970s and 1980s we saw an equalizing trend as well as stable inequalities.

TI Nordic impact: Article productivity and citation patterns in sixteen
   Nordic sociology departments
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
AB The sociology departments in the Nordic countries provide the institutional platform for Nordic Sociology and for the Nordic national sociological associations that form the Scandinavian Sociological Association. This paper focuses on journal articles produced by current (as of 1 January 2001) faculty of 16 of these Nordic Sociology departments in the period 1981-2000. First, we provide a brief overview of article productivity and citations to articles produced in this period by country and department. Second, we estimate a multilevel model of citation patterns by articles published, the academic position and productivity of each author, and the structure and productivity of each department as a whole. Third, we test the extent to which the effects of such factors differ between departments and individuals. In all departments, publications in high-impact journals increase the number of citations to any given article, to other work of the same author, and to the work of other faculty in the department. The effect of publishing in high-impact journals differs significantly between individual authors, and work in certain types of journals yields more citations than the journal impact factor would predict. We argue that departmental affiliations with outside faculty and departmental productivity can be seen as a form of social capital that benefits both individuals and departments as a whole. These findings strongly suggest that diversity is a defining characteristic of this sociological community, precluding monolithic definitions of Nordic sociology.

AB What attitudes relating to differences in occupational earnings did people in state-socialist societies hold before and after the transformation in 1989, compared with people in market-regulated societies? And, how can differences between and changes within these societies in attitudes towards income inequality be explained? To find out, hypotheses are tested using survey data from the International Social Survey Programme, comparing several state-socialist societies with several market societies both before (1987) and after (1992) the political and economic transformation. Before the transformation, the public in central and eastern Europe was much more egalitarian than in market-regulated societies. The results show that the amount of income inequality that people think legitimate has increased in all countries, but the increase was far more dramatic in former state-socialist than in market-regulated societies. Differences in the class and demographic composition of the population hardly explain variations in inequality attitudes between societies, but differences in perceptions of income inequality do.

AB This paper analyses the effects of individual investments in four field-specific educational resources on wages in The Netherlands. Based on a survey on the Dutch population, scales are developed that measure the amount of cultural, economic, communicative and technical resources that fields of study supply to students. It was hypothesized, first, that having invested in any of these four types of resources should enhance entry possibilities into jobs that require related skills and knowledge. Secondly, economic resources are expected to affect wages positively. Thirdly, people whose educational resources match the type of job held are presumed to have a wage benefit from this match. Empirical analyses on two Dutch datasets (n=6,373) generally support the hypotheses, in that matches increased wages in three out of four branches: economic, communicative and technical types of jobs. People who invested in cultural field-specific resources did not have a wage benefit in corresponding types of work, which may be explained by the generic character of the skills obtained.

AB This article addresses the interface between law and the morality of civil society. It starts with a review of the discourse between the utilitarian approach to rationality and perspectives which include normative action. It subsequently explores the dynamics of compliance and noncompliance among a group of Norwegian fishermen. The choice of compliance was guided by an informally enforced set of moral norms, which largely dissolved the connection between expected benefit and the likeliness of infractions. This moral system defined instances in which violations could take place without being met with informal sanctions, and thus also allowed for strategic action to some extent. The article illustrates how civil society enforces the law according to moral rather than legal standards, and it ends with a suggested concept of legitimacy of law.

ID DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE; ATTITUDES
AB In this article, we investigate whether and, if so, to what extent, people's notions of solidarity and their choices of justice principles are related to the type of welfare state regime they live under, as well as to individual socio-demographic and ideological factors. We analyse data from the International Social Survey Program 1996 and the European Values Study 1999, which together cover preferences of citizens from 20 welfare states. Hypotheses pertaining to people's notions of solidarity and preferences for justice principles in the different welfare state regimes are derived from the work of Esping-Andersen and his critics, as well as from sociological and social-psychological theories of solidarity and distributive justice. We find important, although not decisive, evidence for the thesis that the actual state of affairs with respect to the welfare state regime under which citizens live determines their views about which level of solidarity should be achieved and which justice principles should be emphasized. However, differences found are often not very pronounced, and we argue that this is a consequence of the fact that values of solidarity and justice are matters of priority to all welfare states. Taking into account the differences which exist between welfare state regimes, we also find important differences between individuals and social groups in their preferred level of solidarity and in their choice of justice principles.

TI New directions in theorizing the professions: the case of urban planning
   in Sweden
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Professional structure and its relations to certain social fields is an underdeveloped topic of research. A common understatement is that new eras require new professions, that is, when fields change the professional structure also changes. In some cases, the statement might be correct, but this common-sense understanding has little theoretical or empirical support. It ignores the fact that professional structures sometimes actually remain unchanged for long periods, even though the related fields have developed, or vice versa. Nor does it take into account that the knowledge base of the professions can be modified to suit new requirements. Moreover, it seems to underestimate the opportunities for professions to take part actively in field definition. In this paper, a conceptual framework is proposed to enable an analysis of professional structures and their relations to social fields. The professional structure is defined as the composition of professional groups and the power relations between them. The social field is defined as an institutionalized power area comprising actors and institutions struggling for influence. Swedish urban planning offers an excellent case for illustrating the theoretical and methodological findings in the paper. It is concluded that the field of urban planning has changed in some respects, but not fundamentally. The professional structure, on the other hand, has shifted dramatically. The variation in jurisdictional claims and influence can explain why the structure has developed in the ways it has.

AB Pragmatic environmentalism, the increasing use of environmental criteria in industrial and transport activities, is analysed in this article as an instance of economic change and technological development. The article analyses the opportunities for and the obstacles to entrepreneurial activities, which are posed by pragmatic environmentalism, on the basis of interviews made in Sweden. Three types of opportunity are identified : networking brokerage, knowledge oriented (or 'translation') brokerage, and brokerage of organizational or technological novelties. The obstacles are rooted in the inertia of prevailing technological structures and in the fragmentation of practical environmental knowledge, both of which are turned into opportunity by environmental brokers. The resulting opportunity space is presented and it is argued that a collective or 'networked' type of entrepreneurial practice has developed in the openings provided by pragmatic environmentalism. It is also argued that this activity is not necessarily profit-oriented or focused on creating new companies.

DT Review
ID OCCUPATIONAL STRUCTURE; SOCIAL-CLASS; MOBILITY; EARNINGS; MODEL;
   STRATIFICATION; PERSISTENCE; ATTAINMENT; SYSTEMS; CULTURE
AB It has become fashionable to argue that stratification is taking on an increasingly 'postmodern' form, as participation in lifestyles or communities becomes a function of individual taste, choice, and commitment rather than a direct reflection of class membership. Although postmodernism of this sort has become popular in some circles, relevant empirical analyses are few and far between and have inevitably been carried out at a highly aggregate level, thereby muting or obscuring the local subcultures that are generated at the more detailed occupational level. The great failing, then, of conventional quantitative analyses of 'class effects' is that gemeinschaftlich occupations are regarded as nominal categories and are therefore blithely aggregated or dimensionalized. If analyses are instead ratcheted down to the disaggregate level of detailed occupations, the effects of class may become sufficiently strong to cast doubt on the postmodernist retreat from production-based groupings. The purpose of this paper is to lay out the research agenda that this line of reasoning implies. We review new lines of research on such core sociological topics as (a) the underlying structure of social classes, (b) the reproduction of inequality across generations and over the lifecourse, (c) the social processes by which income streams are attached to occupations, and (d) the consequences of class membership for lifestyles, attitudes, and consumption practices.

TI Cultural analyses in urban theory of the 1990s
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
AB In the 1990s, cultural analyses have become an integrated part of urban theory, and culture is often seen as an important factor in the interpretation of both the structural changes of society and the multiplicity of life forms. But culture is not only used as a means to understand actual changes; equally often it is used as a tool to create changes. Under the headings of culture and space, culture and place, and culture and urban policy, the article presents a general view of recent urban theoretical attempts to grasp the role of culture, first in a global, secondly in a local and thirdly in an urban political perspective. The analyses of culture and space focus on the central role of culture and the cultural industries in the reconstruction of the economy, which took place after the economic recession in the 1970s. The spatial consequences of this reconstruction are discussed in terms of globalization, polarization and hierarchization. The analyses of culture and place strive to increase the knowledge of how the structural changes have affected the built environment and the social and cultural life of the city. The consequences are often discussed in terms of gentrification, aesthetization and privatization of public space. Special attention is paid to the growing social polarization and segregation. The analyses of culture and urban policy focus on the role of culture in the effort to strengthen the competitiveness of the city. Two different strategies are discussed, an instrumental one which directly aims at economic growth, and an integrative one where the goal is to restore the cultural hegemony.

TI Women's reproductive health: A gender-sensitive human rights approach
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
ID MORTALITY; ALLOCATION; CHALLENGE; POLICY
AB In general, two broad schemes of analysis have been used recently in the social sciences literature to examine reproductive health. The first type identifies a number of social-structural characteristics associated with reproductive health. The second, the reproductive rights explanation, is of recent origin and advocated by a number of scholars from the public health field. Using data from 125 developing countries, this study tests the two explanations of women's reproductive health. The empirical findings indicate the importance of fertility decline and reproductive rights in predicting reproductive health. An inverse direct relationship between women's reproductive health and their economic status is found. We argue for a gender-sensitive human rights approach toward women's reproductive health.

TI Some things never change: Youth and occupational preferences
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
AB The purpose of this article is to study patterns of occupational preferences among young people in Norway. What do they consider important when they are planning their future occupation? Are their preferences the result of gender, residence or the education of their father? There are different ways of understanding the formation of individual preferences and values. Pierre Bourdieu's concept of habitus is a perspective where such preferences are considered to be the products of structural variables such as educational background, geographical background and gender. As an alternative, a perspective is presented where the underlying assumption is that such determinants have ceased to function and individual freedom is central. In the second part of the article, empirical data are used to test the hypotheses posed by these two opposing perspectives. The data are from a survey conducted among upper secondary school pupils in Norway. The pupils were asked what they regarded as important and less important when choosing their future occupation. The results indicate that, although many pupils embrace post-material values such as self-realization, others think differently. Some of the differences may be explained by educational background and gender. This leads to the conclusion that both perspectives, structural reproduction and individual freedom, are justified when modern society is being discussed.

TI Explaining levels of deprivation in the European Union
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper we seek to explain variations in levels of deprivation between EU countries. The starting-point of our analysis is the finding that the relationship between income and life-style deprivation varies across countries. Given our understanding of the manner in which the income-deprivation mismatch may arise from the limitations of current income as a measure of command over resources, the pattern of variation seems to be consistent with our expectations of the variable degree to which welfare-state regimes achieve 'decommodification' and smooth income flows. This line of reasoning suggests that cross-national differences in deprivation might, in significant part, be due not only to variation in household and individual characteristics that are associated with disadvantage but also to the differential impact of such variables across countries and indeed welfare regimes. To test this hypothesis, we have taken advantage of the ECHP (European Community Household Panel) comparative data set in order to pursue a strategy of substituting variable names for country/welfare regime names. We operated with two broad categories of variables, tapping, respectively, needs and resources. Although both sets of factors contribute independently to our ability to predict deprivation, it is the resource factors that are crucial in reducing country effects. The extent of cross-national heterogeneity depends on specifying the social class and situation in relation to long-term unemployment of the household reference person. The impact of the structural socio-economic variables that we label 'resource factors' varies across countries in a manner that is broadly consistent with welfare regime theory and is the key factor in explaining cross-country differences in deprivation. As a consequence, European homogeneity is a great deal more evident among the advantaged than the disadvantaged.

TI From mobilization to institutionalization? The case of Norwegian
   environmentalism
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
ID CULTURE
AB A widespread view contends that, in due course, political mobilization gives way to institutionalization; that is, vibrant movements turn into rigid hierarchic organizations. In the aftermath of the political radicalization of the 1960s and 1970s, the literature on social movements announced that this 'impasse' belonged to the past: new social movements were taken to be anti-bureaucratic and anti-hierarchical; representing a new historical subject, beyond Marxist determinism, yet retaining a certain leftist-liberalist political imprint. More recently, an almost diametrically opposed contention seems to have gained hegemony: the (new) social movements are becoming institutionalized and are being incorporated, or even co-opted, by the 'establishment'. These general statements stand in glaring contrast to the theoretical progress made within contemporary social movement theory, and accordingly, the purpose of this article is to contribute to a more nuanced approach to the phenomenon of 'institutionalization of social movements', on both a theoretical and an empirical level. Against the backdrop of a short review of literature in the field, a theoretical framework is introduced: institutionalization as an open and multidimensional process, encompassing structural, normative and cognitive elements. Thereafter, this typology is applied in order to study institutionalization as part of a wider context. In one section the Norwegian case is introduced and includes the descriptive empirical analyses: how are Norwegian environmental organizations institutionalized? Thereafter, the context of institutionalization is studied: which strategies are chosen in order to gain influence, and what are the prevalent political ideological orientations? A final section summarizes and discusses the empirical findings in light of the theoretical framework.

ID GENDER DIFFERENCES; WELFARE; ATTITUDES; FAMILY
AB In this study we analyse employment commitment and organizational commitment in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, using data from the International Social Survey Programme (1997). We begin with an institutional comparison of the three countries, where it is concluded that a strong institutionalized commitment to work is of longest standing in Sweden and most recent in Denmark. It is concluded that, contrary to expectations, both employment and organizational commitment among the population is weakest in Sweden and strongest in Denmark. Group patterns in commitment are basically similar in all three countries, the only exception being a lower employment commitment among the unemployed in Denmark. In all three countries, differences related to stratification, such as differences between classes and between educational categories, are much more important than family structure in determining commitment. An especially noteworthy finding is that in all three countries, employment commitment is significantly higher among women than among men.

ID SAMPLE SELECTION BIAS; STATUS ATTAINMENT; RESOURCES; STRENGTH; MOBILITY;
   TIES; MANAGERS; IMPACT; INCOME
AB How information about job openings is distributed is held to be a central determinant of social stratification. Interest here has focused on social networks, yet methodological problems in earlier research prevent definite conclusions from being drawn. Equally serious are the limitations associated with the setting of earlier research, since previous studies have examined the impact of networks in situations in which contact networks would be expected to matter. This article instead explores the limits of social networks by highlighting a situation in which networks are less likely to be of great importance: job search among the unemployed in Sweden. Contact networks have been assumed to be less useful for unemployed job searchers, and Sweden has a substantively important alternative information channel in the public employment agencies. Evidence is offered here on how the employment probability is affected by the use of contacts during the period of job search, with the problem of selection bias taken into explicit consideration. The results indicate network size to be positively related to the probability of employment, but question the importance of tie strength.

DT Article
ID INEQUALITY; SCHOOL
AB This article focuses mainly on the key results of research on the differences in participation in higher education in Finland in the 1980s and 1990s. The recent discussion surrounding the methods of measuring participation in higher education is also considered. The results show that, in 1980, the odds for children of the well educated participating in higher education was 13 times greater than that of children of fathers with only a basic level of education. Since then, the trend has decreased slowly from 12 in 1985 to 10 in 1995. Despite the various egalitarian policy measures applied by the State, the difference in participation, indicated by the odds ratio 10, is still enormous, and the actual situation for youth with poor family backgrounds has not changed during the past decades. The persistent inequality of educational opportunity in relative terms revealed by the odds ratio, which the authors argue to be the appropriate measure for changes over time, is analysed further by exploring regional differences and the differences between various fields of study. It is shown that the real competition for higher education is among the well off. This is illustrated by a metaphor from bicycle racing: even if the tail-end cyclists reach the main pack, the front-runners widen their gap between the main pack.

TI Trends in the occupational returns to educational credentials in the
   dutch labor market: Changes in structures and in the association?
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
ID OVEREDUCATION; EXPANSION; MOBILITY; WORKERS; LEVEL
AB In this article, we determine changes in the relationship between education and the labor market in The Netherlands since 1960, for which both developments in the distribution of the labor force according to educational attainment and level of occupation (structural changes) and shifts in the mechanism to allocate educated individuals to occupational positions (which modify the net association between education and occupation) are used. To observe both developments, we make use of data from the 1960 Census and four Labor Force Surveys held in 1973, 1977, 1985, and 1991. Loglinear analysis shows that the association between education and occupation has altered. We conclude that changes in the relationship between education and occupation are not only the result of structural changes, but also the outcome of changes in the way educated individuals are allocated to jobs. These shifts in the allocation mechanism are largely connected with the state of the business cycle: in times of high unemployment, employers increasingly select employees on the basis of their education. We also find some support for modernization theory, but as soon as the state of the business cycle is accounted for, the impact of modernization becomes non-significant.

TI Leadership in a communicative perspective
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
AB In analyzing a reform process at a Norwegian hospital, a central finding was that successful leadership depends upon actors assuming a communicative mode of interaction. This contradicts the instrumental view of leadership underlying the New Public Management approach, whose emphasis is on efficiency and goal achievement through employment of external sanctions. How can it be that leaders who give priority to reaching common understandings rather than on realizing specific goals are more successful? The unique feature of communicative leadership is its focus on legitimacy, which is achieved through rational conducted deliberation aimed at solving problems and resolving conflicts. This article depicts the varying organizational conditions favoring communicative leadership, such as decentralization, co-decision-making, and team-leadership. More specifically, delegation, reduced span of control, and dispersion of power are among the factors that contribute to a communicative mode of coordination.

TI Gendered aspects of time related to everyday journeys
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Time is a significant dimension of the everyday journey. The temporal aspects of a journey are both quantitative and qualitative. The perception of time has been related to different time order systems in various societies and to differences within the spheres of production and reproduction. In this paper the differences between men and women in attitudes towards different time aspects of transport are analysed and discussed, with the empirical results based on a survey from Oslo 1993. A random sample of 1,053 persons, 18 years or older, was interviewed about everyday activities, travel and attitudes related to transport. The analyses show that there are diversities between groups of men and women in the perception of time and time use associated with the means of transport. On average, women have a more positive attitude towards public transport than men, and women also are more willing to accept longer travel times if one has to use public transport instead of the car. It is argued that the dominant time order related to production, the temporal practice in everyday life and the experienced time could explain some of these differences. In relation to these aspects of social time, men's and women's position and perception are different.

TI Trends in the intergenerational transmission of cultural and economic

SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
ID EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT; ACHIEVEMENT; ASCRIPTION; IMPACT
AB Research on intergenerational occupational mobility in The Netherlands has shown that the association between the occupational positions of parents and their offspring has decreased over time. This article elaborates on the idea that the occupational stratification includes both a cultural and an economic hierarchy and that the process of intergenerational mobility follows different patterns in these two dimensions. The main hypothesis is that the intergenerational transmission of cultural status is related more strongly to the indirect channel, via educational attainment, than the transmission of economic status, and that the equalization of educational opportunities has especially affected the cultural transmission of social status. Data from The Netherlands' Mobility File are used, and the occupational mobility of 5,921 men and 3,457 women between 35 and 65 years of age is analyzed for cohorts who entered the labor market between 1923 and 1984. The findings are that the direct transmission of both cultural and economic status has virtually disappeared by the end of the observation period, for both men and women. For men, the indirect channel via education has decreased in the cultural dimension but not in the economic dimension. For women, the trends in the total effects of fathers' cultural and economic status are much weaker than those for men, which is caused by an increase of the indirect channel via education in both dimensions.

TI National context, individual characteristics and attitudes on mothers'
   employment: A comparative analysis of Great Britain, Sweden and Norway
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
ID MATERNAL EMPLOYMENT; WORK; FAMILY
AB This article examines how a general social process - the struggle toward gender equality - is reflected in the public opinion on mothers' employment in three different modern welfare states: Great Britain, Sweden and Norway. Viewing such attitudes as reponses to structural changes in women's relation to the labour market, the possible between- and within-country variations in these attitudes are hypothesized. The data are drawn from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) and the results from a large cross-national survey are used. It is found that women are more positive than men, and that the younger, the better-educated and the less religious members of society are the most positive to mother's employment in all three countries. As for the between-country variations, it is found that the Swedes are the most positive and the Norwegians the most negative. It is suggested that Great Britain's longer history of industrialization and of urban married women's employment explains why the British people are more positive towards mothers' employment than Norwegians, despite the Norwegian welfare policies with their much stronger emphasis on supporting gender equality and mothers' employment.

TI Systems theory as an alternative to action theory? The rise of
   'communication' as a theoretical option
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIETY
AB The argument of the essay has two main parts. First, it reflects on the presumed conflict between action theories and systems theories in sociology Looking at authors such as James Coleman, Talcott Parsons and Niklas Luhmann, the essay tries to show that there is a natural complementarity of action and systems theories, and therefore the presumed disjunction of 'action' and 'system' is not based on the empirical reality of theory-building ventures. But then another line of conflict becomes visible. Since the information theories of the late 1940s, 'communication theory' has become a viable and universalistic option in social theory, one that indeed conflicts with action theory. In its second part, the essay first gives a brief sketch of the conceptual career of communication theory since Shannon and Weaver. It then presents the sociological theory of Niklas Luhmann as the first major sociological theory that opts for communication as the constitutive element of society and other social systems. Causes and reasons for this theoretical decision are reconstructed, first in terms of problems internal to Niklas Luhmann's social theory (the distinction of psychic and social systems; the distinction of action and experience; formal properties of the concept of communication; the implications of autopoiesis) and secondly in terms of processes of societal change (the rise of the information society; the genesis of world society), which favour the switch towards a communication-based (instead of action-based) systems theory.

It is argued that both Parsons' general sociology and Marxism render more plausible accounts of modern society than does Luhmann's theory of autopoietic systems. It is asserted that the fundamental mistake in Luhmann's theory is his conflation of the concepts of differentiated social systems and autonomous social systems, a conflation that confers a ring of the imaginary to Luhmann's treatise.

TI Rational solidarity and functional differentiation
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
AB The article is based on the idea that the problem of unity or integration of modern society has not yet been solved in sociological theory. The paper attempts a new solution based on a creative synthesis of elements from Talcott Parsons' functionalism, rational choice theory, and Niklas Luhmann's new systems theory. The core idea is that the state and the political sphere work together as an integrating centre of modern societies. Present approaches understand the political allocation of resources either as an exchange process or as solidarity caused by internalized social norms. None of them embodies a concept of collective rationality; therefore they cannot give a dynamic account of the public allocation of collective goods. This dichotomy of individual rationality and norm-guided behaviour will be produced and reproduced on the level of general theory in the discussion on the problem of order or collective action as long as sociology is founded on the assumption that society is made up of individual human beings and their actions. However, by replacing action with Luhmann's concept of communication and rethinking collective action within this new framework, it becomes possible to develop a concept of collective rationality. This new conceptualization is used to clear up problems and overcome shortcomings in Luhmann's own theory of modern society as functionally differentiated. Observed as a consequence of action, function is collective action. A solution to the problem of collective action or social order is found with the emergence of rational solidarity as a medium that symbolizes the difference between individual and collective rationality as a unity: one should sacrifice individual opportunities to achieve collective goals and solve problems for the society to which one belongs.

TI Public market - Political firms
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
AB The main argument in this paper is that private companies become an integral part of the political system when public services are contracted out. Private companies begin to compete for influence on political goals to strengthen their positions for future tenders. Firms that are subcontractors to the public sector find that everyday financial decisions may have an impact on the political process. It becomes necessary for a private fir in the public market to internalize the logic of politics. The system theory developed by Niklas Luhmann is the theoretical point of departure, while the empirical study examines the Danish firm Scan Care and its attempt to construct a market for services for elderly people in the first half of the 1990s. The author of this article believes that when public services are contracted out to the private sector, the size of both sectors changes, as does the quality of the relationship between public and private and the semantic meaning of both terms. Contracting out not only leads to a larger market, but also to more politics. Politics explode out of the framework of the public sector into the private sector and become a basic condition for the involvement of firms in public markets.

TI System's sole constituent, the operation: Clarifying a central concept
   of Luhmannian theory
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
AB The autopoietic turn in Luhmann's later theory is not thinkable without the refocusing of systems theory around a new concept of operativity. The article shows the lines of development from the earlier theory towards the final prevailing of a purely operativist conception of the system. The movement is one of deconstructing all intuitive representations of a border-defined, thing-like system. The radical version that emerges leaves the operation as the sole and unique systemic constituent. The article shows that such a strain of thought contracting an extensive transitive structure into a purely operative core has major philosophical antecedents: Aristotle's conception of the actuation of life or intellection in a composite being, Fichte's self-position of the transcendental I, Heidegger's subject and authorless 'Ereignis' constitute very similar figures of 'operativization'. This sheds light on the most problematic aspect of Luhmannian theory namely its reliance on a 'protologic' that does not elaborate, like similar philosophical endeavours before it, on the fundaments of its own evidence.

SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA

DT Article
AB From the work of Weber onwards charisma has been primarily explained in terms of its relationship to underlying social structural and psychological environments. The paper redresses this imbalance and examines the cultural structures that operate as preconditions for the attribution of charisma to political and religious leaders. Drawing on Weberian, Durkheimian and semiotic theory the paper argues that charisma arises in conjunction with salvation narratives. The internal structure of these narratives requires binary oppositions contrasting good and evil. The model is exemplified with reference to case studies of Hitler, Churchill and Martin Luther King.

AB This article studies the joking relationships among the Scandinavian countries, Norway, Sweden and Denmark, Based on joke collections from books, the Internet and other sources, we find that Danes tell jokes about the Norwegians and Swedes, while Norwegians and Swedes tell jokes about each other, but not about the Danes, In general, the Danes tell jokes in which the butt, or object, of the jokes is a stupid Norwegian or a Swede whose values differ from those of the Danes, The Norwegians and the Swedes tell jokes in which the object is stupid - either a Norwegian or a Swede. The different values/stupid characterizations can be found in other contexts. The character of the jokes can be explained in part: by the countries' respective national habitus, as they have been shaped by the types of conflictual and co-operative relationships among the countries.

TI How inter-firm co-operation depends on social embeddedness: A vignette
   study
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
ID COOPERATION
AB This paper examines the effects of the social context of economic exchange on the governance of transactions In buyer-supplier relations between firms. We distinguish three dimensions of social embeddedness of transactions, namely, repeated exchange between the partners (temporal embeddedness), relations with third parties such as other firms (network embeddedness) and social institutions that allow for credible agreements and commitments (institutional embeddedness). Together with transaction characteristics, social embeddedness shapes trust problems in economic exchange and how firms mitigate such trust problems through contractual planning. More precisely, we analyse how transaction characteristics and social embeddedness affect effort invested in contractual planning. We argue that social embeddedness provides alternatives for costly contractual planning, such as reciprocity and conditional co-operation. Forty purchase managers participated in a factorial survey. Virtual transactions were presented. Each transaction was represented by a vignette composed of eight characteristics, the levels of which were varied randomly. Three characteristics represented 'economic' features of transactions, namely, transaction-specific investments, monitoring problems and volume of the transaction. Five vignette characteristics represented social embeddedness: the history of previous transactions between the partners, expected future transactions, voice and exit networks and a rough indicator of institutional embeddedness. The purchase managers had to judge how much time negotiations would take, and also how many departments would be involved, Results show that social embeddedness leads a purchase manager to put less effort into the management of the transaction. While one-sided specific investments, monitoring problems and the Volume of a transaction induce more negotiation efforts, such efforts decrease if transactions are embedded 'better' in a temporal or network sense, or if buyer and supplier can rely on more institutional embeddedness.

TI Manufacturing change: A two-country, three-industry comparison
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
ID LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; FLEXIBILITY; SWEDEN; CANADA
AB There are three broad explanations for why workers adapt, or fail to adapt, to technological change in the workplace. The adversarial perspective holds that employment security produces resistant workers, and conversely that insecurity assures efficiency in adapting a workforce to technological and organizational changes. Institutionalists argue the opposite, emphasizing that secure workers have little to fear from change, Finally, a neo-corporatist variant sees managers and powerful trade-union leaders as capable of successfully negotiating industrial changes, independently of rank and file preferences. In this paper we explore these explanations via interview data collected from managers and trade unionists (or labour representatives) from Canada and Sweden. Our focus is on three industries - pulp and paper, steel and telecommunications equipment. Analyses deal with specific questions associated with the introduction of new equipment and technology, attempts to introduce organizational restructuring, and experiences with layoffs. We further examine respondents' comments on obstacles encountered during the change process, including the reactions, conflicts and grievances of the rank and file workers at their plants, mills and factories. On the whole, the results of our interviews with respondents at seventy-three plants in our three-industry two-country comparison seem to contradict the strict adversarial theory. While our data provide some evidence in favour of the institutionalist perspective, the neo-corporatist arguments found the most support. Swedish trade union leaders were viewed by managers, and viewed themselves, as more positively disposed to change than either their Canadian counterparts or workers in either country.

TI Individual social action and macro level dynamics: A formal theoretical
   model
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
AB When large numbers of individuals interact and influence each other's choices of action, the relationship between a single individual's action and the aggregate outcome on the macro-level is far from straightforward and is therefore difficult to predict. In this paper, a theoretical model is developed that can be used to analyze how the evolution of different macro-phenomena depends upon social actions at the micro level. The model, which takes as its point of departure a set of analytical diagrams developed by T.C. Schelling (1978), is precise yet applicable to the analysis of a range of different social situations. The wide applicability of the model is demonstrated by examining two seemingly disparate social processes. One concerns the growth of a social movement and the other the prevalence of condom use in the population. Underlying both these processes is a system of interaction in which purposeful actors react to an environment that consists largely of other actors reacting in a like manner. The focus of the analysis is on the complex aggregate outcomes that these systems of interaction generate.

AB Re-interpreting Simmel's work on money as an attempt to develop a critical sociology of consumption from a relativist theory of value, this paper illustrates the extent to which it may be seen as something more, and different than, sociological impressionism. The modern social space of valuation is chiefly defined by the development of money economy within metropolitan settings. This allows for the public commensurability of values and pushes for their private incompatibility. Subjectivism is heightened in so far as individuals' capacity to sustain difference is vital to social, objective exchange. Contrary to neo-classical economics, the appreciation of individual choice entails for Simmel a critical appraisal of the social conditions of its existence which results in a discussion of the risks associated with the pressure to perform as autonomous choosers. The paper concludes with a view on what may be a Simmelian sociology of consumption, one which enriches the classical focus on social distinction with a critical concern for the modern conditions of valuation and self-constitution. Fashion and style may be conceived of as techniques of consumption that, embodying particular combinations of difference and indifference, help govern the modern world of goods. In this view, these mundane practices have the potential to function as a balancing practice of self-constitution, taking place between the indifference of the market which allows individualization, and the risk that the individuality thus constituted remains empty, a reproducer of commensurability unable to bestow value on things.

AB We investigated young people in mid-adolescence who do not drink alcohol. These young people were at an age when alcohol consumption was about to become normative behaviour. The sample consisted of a total cohort (n = 3,424) of pupils enrolled in the 10th grade in the school system in Oslo, in the age group 16-17 years, of whom 16.8 percent had never drunk alcohol. Bivariate analyses revealed that nondrinkers often came from lower socio-economic strata and had family backgrounds with low levels of cultural capital. Logistic regression analyses suitable for clustered data with a hierarchical structure (MlwiN) revealed, however, that these associations disappeared when ethnicity was controlled for. Living area in Oslo had a significant impact on the probability of being an abstainer, and there was an independent effect of school attended. Furthermore, non-drinkers were often from non-western immigrant backgrounds. This association was particularly strong among immigrant girls. Muslims were often non-drinkers, and religion played an important role in the lives of the nondrinkers. However, the traditional temperance movement plays no part in this picture any more. We also found significant associations to weak social networks and perceived loneliness. On the other hand, we found that non-drinkers had significantly better mental health than the rest of the sample. Historically, alcohol abstainers in Norway have been recruited from the non-secularized and tradition-bound segments of society, and they have represented what has been labelled a 'morally religious lifestyle'. There is much to indicate that we still find such patterns - but now in totally new groups, namely the new non-western immigrants..

TI The logic of affirmative action: Caste, class and quotas in India
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Most social scientists today agree that identity is a social construction, not a primordial given. They also agree that the state (through its power to dominate discourse) is a key agent in the process of identity construction. The literature on caste in India is illustrative. Caste used to be thought of as an ancient fact of Hindu life, but contemporary scholars argue that the caste system was constructed by the British colonial regime. The social construction thesis should apply a fortiori to a project begun by the Indian government almost 50 years ago and still going strong, namely affirmative action for the 'backward classes'. This project is strikingly similar to the British colonial project that ex hypothesi constructed the caste system. The government defines social categories (official constructions) under which people must register in order to qualify for the material rewards - jobs and education - that made these constructions real in their consequences. The tangible effects of affirmative action differ, however, from what the social construction theory predicts. The backward classes never emerged as a viable identity. What emerged instead was a multiplicity of castes. The government's prolonged attempt ever since independence to construct the 'backward classes' only reinforced the caste system. The logic of affirmative action explains this unintended outcome.

TI Edward Westermarck: A sociologist relating nature and culture
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Biographical-Item
AB A core idea in all of Edward Westermarck's studies is the strong connection between nature and culture. As attempts to survive environmental threats, moral ideas contain similarities in a very wide range of historical situations. Westermarck connected nature and culture in the three major fields of his scholarship: in his studies of the human marriage and family, in his Moroccan field-work dealing with rituals and moral beliefs, and in his studies of the origin of moral ideas and emotions. There have been remarkable vicissitudes in his scholarly fame, In the early 20th century he was a leading international sociologist, His large treatises on the history of human marriage and the origin of the moral ideas were translated to many languages and his ideas were intensively discussed. Already in the 1920s Westermarck's scholarship based on evolutionism and Darwinism tended to become neglected, and during the subsequent decades it was largely ignored by both sociologists and anthropologists. During the two last decades of the 20th century, however, tendencies towards a renaissance of the ideas of Edward Westermarck are clearly observable. (C) Scandinavian Sociological Association 2000.

AB The current of sociological thought was brought to Iceland from overseas by Guomundur Finnbogason (1873-1944) at the beginning of the 20th century That was a full 60 years before sociology entered the curriculum of the University of Iceland. When Finnbogason returned home from his studies abroad soon after 1900, he was influenced strongly by Henri Bergson, William James and pragmatism, and was focusing on the importance of imitation in comprehending the inner minds of other people. What is remarkable nowadays is that these focal points sound like a prologue to the school of symbolic interactionism. His doctoral dissertation on sympathetic comprehension (1911) was written in Danish and subsequently translated into French. The French translation attracted the attention of Jean Piaget, who noted Finnbogason's theories on imitation. (C) Scandinavian Sociological Association 2000.

AB Hilma Granqvist was educated at Helsinki University in the tradition of the Westermarck School, The topic of her dissertation 'Women in the Old Testament' led her to carry out fieldwork in Palestine. Between 1925 and 1931 she carried out fieldwork in the village of Artas, in all a 3-year period. Her radical decision to study only one village and thereby restrain from wider comparisons severed her relationship with her supervisor, Consequently she could not present her thesis at Helsinki University. Westermarck allowed her to defend it at Abo Akademi University in January 1932. We acted as her opponent even though he was just retiring from his professorship there, In Granqvist's dissertation on marriage conditions in Artas, as well as in her other publications, methods that combined statistics, participant observation and commentaries by local people were used. This combination made her able to distinguish between the ideal and the actual. Hilma Granqvist became the victim of a stagnating scientific school. Her academic career was totally blocked in Finland. Although she received international recognition, she had to work alone without support and encouragement, (C) Scandinavian Sociologlcal Association 2000.

He spent 3 years in exile in Sweden. Geiger is an important figure in German and Scandinavian sociology and also known in English-speaking countries. He was a prolific teacher and writer. Throughout his life as a sociologist Geiger combined theoretical with empirical interest. If he rejected all speculation without a factual basis, he showed an equally strong disdain for empiricism without a theoretical foundation (Mayntz 1969). His works cover a broad spectrum of subjects, still of professional interest, such as: the foundation and fundamental concepts of sociology, the education of working-class people, industrial organization, class structure, stratification and mobility, social origin and functions of the intelligentsia, the sociology of law, critics of ideology and the nature of modern mass-society and democracy.

TI Gunnar Myrdal: A theorist of modernity
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Biographical-Item
AB Gunnar Myrdal's contribution to social science could be encapsulated in the following key words: secularization, intellectual migration and trans-Atlantic reciprocity, objectivity and value-intrusion (-bias), the role of philanthropy, Protestant reform creed, social engineering, and national styles of research, Myrdal's central role in the history of social thought is his part in facilitating the diffusion of Weberian value-orientation, despite differences in nuances between Myrdal and his neo-Kantian predecessors. His ocuvre Is multi-disciplinary and he could himself be characterized in terms of a number of antinomies, such as the parochial cosmopolitan, the patriotic internationalist, the compassionate 'nihilist', the elitist egalitarian, the social Darwinist anti-racist, the male chauvinist feminist, the ahistorical 'historicist', the conservative socialist, etc. He never hesitated to take a controversial position. Essentially he is a theorist of modernity, combining ambiguity and antinomies with anti-metaphysics (anti-natural law instrumental means-end-analyses). (C) Scandinavian Sociological Association 2000.

DT Biographical-Item
AB Alva Myrdal (1902-86), the Swedish feminist social scientist, is shown here to be a sociologist: of honour Her contribution to sociology is that she analysed the women's perspective of the societal division of labour, and made that private sector an important issue on the public political agenda, IF women were to come out as citizens men must play their part in the care work of society and institutions had to be reorganized to accommodate women, men and children. She therefore studied family sociology, sexual politics, Education and child care. She also researched peace and conflicts. Her main books are The Crisis in the Population Question (in Swedish with C. Myrdal 1934), Nation and Family (1941), Women's Two Roles (with V. Klein 1956) and The Game of Disarmament (1976).

TI Sociology and normative power: The heritage of Torgny T. Segerstedt
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Biographical-Item
ID SWEDISH
AB Torgny T:son Segerstedt (1908-99) was the first duly appointed professor of sociology in Sweden, With a background in philosophy, early in his career Segerstedt was occupied with questions of symbolic communication and normative structures. From Segerstedt's understanding of social life follows the importance of social control and symbolic power whose most condensed expression in his perspective are norms. Segerstedt's focus on symbolic and normative structures gave him an early social constructivist perspective, applied, e.g. in research concerning travellers. Segerstedt advocated an empirical approach of sociology but considered a theoretical framework necessary for guiding research and making 'facts' intelligible. The basic social unit in Segerstedt's conception of sociology is the social group, constituted to a high degree by shared norms and common norm sources. Segerstedt was interested in the consequences of changing group structure and changing functional structure in modern society. (C) Scandinavian Sociological Association 2000.

AB Kaare Svalastoga (1914-97) was born in Norway. After World War ii he received a PhD in Sociology from the USR and in 1950 he became professor of Sociology at the University of Copenhagen, Ile founded the Department of Sociology, malting it possible for the first time in Denmark for students to obtain degrees in sociology. His most important publications were devoted to social stratification. His scientific point of view was positivistic and he believed that sociology should resemble the natural sciences as closely as possible. This point of view led to strong conflicts between Svalastoga and those scholars who took the approach of Marxism, an approach that became very popular at the Department in the 1970s. Ultimately Svalastoga became isolated within the Department he had founded. Despite the turn of events he maintained strong ties with scholars In his field in countries around the world, (C) Scandinavian Sociological Association 2000.

DT Biographical-Item
AB Verner Goldschmidt (1916-82), Danish sociologist of law and culture, is known mainly for his longitudinal cultural sociological and legal studies in Greenland. He drew up the bill for the criminal code for Greenland, based on legal anthropological studies at the West coast, and he studied the Arctic peace model for criminal justice and the passibility of resolving conflict without violence in other societal situations (Cyprus), In 1964, at the University of Copenhagen, he founded the curriculum in cultural sociology for the faculty of humanities as a reaction to the positivistic development of the sociological discipline at the faculty of economics and social science. He also built up the department of cultural sociology. The following presentation concentrates on his participation in the juridical expedition to West-Greenland 1948-50, his current studies of the development after the enactment of the Greenlandic criminal code, his dissertation on the behaviour of the judicial authorities and the Arctic peace model, and his contribution to conflict resolution without violence, (C) Scandinavian Sociological Association 2000.

TI Stein Rokkan's thick comparisons
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Biographical-Item
AB Among Nordic social scientists during the postwar period, Stein Rokkan made the clearly most important contribution to comparative historical sociology, This article distinguishes three phases of his work: a phase of early experiences in the 1950s, followed by two mature phases in the 1960s and 1970s. In both these phases Rokkan wanted to explain the diversity of European political systems, hut in the second mature phase he developed a much broader framework to analyse the economic, territorial and cultural contexts of Europe's political developments. The methodology of his conceptual maps and his model of Europe is discussed in some detail. It is argued that in his mature work, Rokkan increasingly departed both from variables-oriented sociology and mainstream positivist methodology. The notion of theory implied by his mature work corresponds best to the notion found among critics of variables-oriented sociology, and it converges with the notions of grounded theory and thick description as developed in interactionist schools of sociology.

TI 'The most important task of sociology is to strengthen and defend
   rationality in public discourse': On the sociology of Vilhelm Aubert
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Biographical-Item
AB Vilhelm Aubert (1922-88), the internationally recognized sociologist of law, contributed more than any other individual to define and develop sociology as a broad discipline in Norway after the end of World War II, In this article sociology is analyzed as a combination of five different activities and intended results, as (1) research and publications; (2) teaching and educated students at different levels; (3) dissemination and public-discourse, contributing to opinion and will-formation in civil society; (4) expert services and improvements for users; and (5) self-governance resulting in well-functioning institutions, with regard to research, studies, dissemination and expert activity. This conception is used in the description and analysis of Aubert's work. During 40 years he completed a large number of research projects, organized large research projects, built academic studies, influenced public discourse, developed plans for sociological practice and built institutions for sociology and other social sciences. Norwegian sociology is perhaps of a special interest in this sociology of sociology context because of its size and influence, Relative to population, the number of sociologists in Norway is probably larger than in any other country, and it may be the case that their general impact on society is stronger than in any other nation.
