ID HABITUS
AB Sociologists have long been interested in the question of transmission, studying it in connection with quite diverse areas : social and occupational identity, economic concerns, religion, political opinions, lifestyles and culture. Those Studies usually compare attitudes, possessions, or values of successive generations, either by comparing the generations or collecting "retrospective" information from adult respondents. They are less likely to examine paired parent-children populations, which is the method used here. Data oil pre-adolescents and adolescents aged 10 to 14 and their parents were studied to identify modes of cultural transmission. Factors that work to transmit parents' relation 10 Cultural activities its a whole were then modeled to bring to light the cultural dynamics and stasis between generations and outline a few features characterizing the change in the role played by culture in defining the generations themselves.

TI A return to the history of labor sociology in France : place and role of
   the Institut des sciences sociales du travail
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB According to most authors who have studied the history of labor sociology ill France, that specialization came into being at the Centre d'etudes sociologiques. But if previously unknown facts are examined, it becomes clear that this proposition needs to be corrected : the Institut des sciences sociales du travail must be attributed its proper weight in the founding of this scientific specialization. The institute was created by the Ministry of Labor and assigned the task of researching labor-related problems. This policy, which fit into the overall framework for modernizing France in the 1950s, immediately encountered the hopes and expectations of recently hired CNRS researchers. This analysis shows how that encounter unfolded and what it has left to its heirs : a research movement and a style; a journal.

TI Prisoners' work in prison : the meaning and arrangement of time as
   experienced by imprisoned workers
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB The practical and symbolic social effects of work on how imprisoned persons relate to time is studied here from a labor Sociology perspective. In the thinking of Donald Clemmer and Erving Goffman, two classic sociologists of the prison, the unity of the confined prison space goes together with it unity of time. But in direct opposition to these approaches, the findings of a field study conducted in five French prisons suggests that the private life/occupational life split characteristic of wage-paid labor is also relevant for the lives of incarcerated workers. The work they do enhances prison security. For the imprisoned workers themselves it is a major means reappropriating space and time in a context of freedom-deprivation. Prison labor is analyzed as a means of socialization within a continuum of prisoners' past work-lives.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB This article probes relations between French judiciary and Municipal actors in handling issues of public security at a time when programs are being implemented to promote partnership actions between these two sets of actors in response to the spread of state and regional-level contracting, the promotion of multidisciplinary approaches, and demand from cities. A monographic study is the basis for analyzing relations under way in this context. Despite occasional exchanges, cooperation between municipalities and the judiciary institution remains weak. Their relations are characterized more by avoidance than open conflict, however : actors, prefer to withdraw discreetly from the partnerships rather than express their disagreements. This is due to the fact that the two groups follow highly differentiated types of action logic, though this does not preclude their recognizing each other's roles. The two sets of actors do not define problems in the same way, and this affects how they order their priorities and what action modes they prefer.

TI A new adolescence
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB Several studies of adolescence have been published recently; their viewpoints differ significantly. This critical overview presents the debate launched by these publications on the place of contemporary adolescence and how it should be interpreted sociologically. Continuing in the vein of his previous works, Francois de Singly's book on "adonaissants" [adolescents in the or process of being "born"] presents a reading of this period in the life cycle in identity terms; its central theme is adolescents' non-conflictual oscillation between family-related identity and peer-group-related indentity. Singly's vision is ultimately quite optimistic. Other studies, such as Dominique Pasquier's on French high school student cultures, presents a grimmer and fairly divergent picture. Focused more on peer groups, these studies brings to light the increasing cultural distance between the world of adolescents and the world of adults and the school. This review essay also examines the impact that a new kind of adolescent autonomy may have had on relations between parents and children in families of different social backgrounds, relating this to classical studies of child-raising models and their finding of an "authoritarian" style for the working-class and a "negotiation" approach for the middle and upper classes.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB The issue of the influence of norms on behaviour is as old as sociology itself. Institutional theorists, such as Selznick ( 1957), theorized this influence in terms of << precarious values)>>. This paper uses this classical view to bring in structure between norms and behaviour. To do this, we explore the selection effect (Snijders, 2001, 2005) of a conflict of norms (a controversy) on the evolution of the advice network among lay judges at the Commercial Court of Paris and on their decisions. We use a jurisprudential case about unfair competition (material and << moral >> damages), a case that we submitted to all the judges of this court. The controversy among them is about the extent to which they should be << punitive >> in awarding damages, especially << moral. damages. We examine the criteria and norms that they refer to in their discretionary decision making in this case. Statistical analyses using Siena combine longitudinal advice network data collected among them with their normative dispositions. We show that, in spite of declaring themselves to be punitive, the majority of judges align themselves on judges with a law degree coming from the banking industry, who tend to be non punitive. We measure and model the selection effect of this norm on the evolution of the network, teasing out a << preferential attachment)>> effect in which bankers with a law degree become ever more central over time in these networks. This allows them to exercise a strong influence on the court's judicial decision making. We argue that this approach of conformity and alignments in controversies provides new insights into the relationship between norms, structure and behaviour.

AB This study examined selection and influence processes related to friends' school involvement and delinquent behaviors during adolescence. We applied models of network-behavioral dynamics (Snijders, Steglich, and Schweinberger, 2007) to a five-year longitudinal sample of Swedish youth (n = 445). Results indicate youth selectively nominated : a) friends who reciprocated their nomination; b) who were friends of those whom they nominated; c) same-sex schoolmates; and d) peer affiliates with similar levels of school involvement and engagement in delinquent behaviors. Influence effects emerged such that youth tended to adopt the delinquent behaviors of peer affiliates. Furthermore, school involvement predicted subsequent changes in delinquent behaviors and delinquency predicted subsequent changes in school involvement.

AB Individuals manipulating and diffusing knowledge are constituting various knowledge communities. We show that the dynamics of these communities may be adequately described and appraised through a formal framework based on the joint use of a social and a semantic network. By empirically assessing network processes and, notably, the underpinnings of collaboration formation, we substantiate the hypothesis that a coevolution of both the social network and the distribution of concepts throughout the network makes it possible to explain the occurrence of several stylized facts relevant for these communities, foremost the emergence and dynamic stability of epistemic communities and various types of self-reinforcing social and socio-semantic heterogeneities and homogeneities in the network. We focus on the case study of a well-defined scientific community working on a precise research topic, the zebrafish.

ID ACTOR-ORIENTED MODELS; CENTRALITY
AB Becoming an adult goes together with changes in sociability that are related to socialization processes. Changes in individuals' personal networks provide an image of the processes of social inscription at work. The persons who make up an individual's family and close social circles also affect the direction(s) that individual takes by way of their advice and influence, which when taken together may be dissonant. On the basis of a longitudinal study that has been following a panel of young people for over ten years, the relations between how personal networks evolve and what paths young people take toward adult life are explored. Identifying << significant others >> and why they are influential, and studying how and to what degree they remain central in the young person's network, are a means to identify the different kinds of selection, influence and composition logic that jointly shape network and socialization process dynamics.

This article have a close look on the interactions between various levels of action in a study of this process using a retrospective method based on cases histories which combine cross interviews with written sources. The analysis of this data shows that, beyond the creation of new resources which are distinctive of the new firm, a great part of the process is made of mobilizing existing resources through personal relations or more generic means, and also of changes concerning the links between the actors and the boundaries between the organizations.

AB We argue that sociological explanations proposed within the social capital framework to explain individual well-being are incomplete because they do not differentiate between interpersonal influence and selection mechanisms, on the one hand, and cognitive intra-personal processes. on the other. To this end. three theoretical models of the dynamic interaction between interpersonal trust and job satisfaction will be used to derive and empirically test six hypotheses. First, according to influence mechanisms, an individual's job satisfaction can be the result of the number of sociometric trust choices he or she receives (popularity effect) or the level of job satisfaction of those actors he/she trusts (contagion effect). Second, selection mechanisms postulate that a focal actor will be more likely to develop interpersonal trust in colleagues with a high job satisfaction (attractiveness effect) or with similar levels of job satisfaction as the focal actor (homophily effect). Third, according to intrapersonal spillover mechanisms, a high level of job satisfaction can either facilitate the creation of interpersonal trust relationships (satisfaction spillover effect), or individuals initiating a high number of interpersonal trust relationships can exhibit higher levels of satisfaction (trust spillover effect). To simultaneously test these six hypotheses, longitudinal intra-organizational social network data from a Dutch housing company (n = 57) were used. We found a significant contagion effect, but no support for a popularity effect or either selection effect. Moreover, contrary to what we expected, employees with a low level of job satisfaction were significantly more likely to develop trust relationships with others.

The source data for the study are answers to a survey of 668 pupils in second and fourth forms of five middle schools with populations that vary greatly in terms of social make-up and scholastic performance. Multivariate analysis allows for identifying the specific impact of each sociodemographic and schooling variable. All else equal, the probability of being punished for most types of punishment depends mainly on pupil's school performance, sex, social origins, school pupil is enrolled in, and behaviour in class. Ethnic group does not affect probability of being punished, contrary to what previous studies may have concluded.

DT Article
AB French knowledge of the Arab world changed profoundly between 1950 and 1980. Considering the case of Arab intellectuals in Paris universities, the article analyzes the types of logic that fueled this epistemological change. Specifically, it circumscribes the relevance of an institutional explanation : knowledge of the ways that academic and scientific institutions changed is essential for grasping the process under study, but that kind of development does not fully account for the complexity of the process. The changes in knowledge seem characterized by multiple time frames, ambivalent and sometimes contradictory movements - in contradistinction to the more linear development of institutions. Studying the trajectories and writings of Arab intellectuals allows for a more complex vision of the stages involved in humanities knowledge change.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

ID STATE
AB This article originated with a puzzle : how best to account for changes in the behavior of groups, organizations and individuals in Great Britain ? A detailed analysis of what Weber and Polanyi identified as interdependencies between state and market, and of the state's role in creating the market, led to the decision to adapt the notion of bureaucratic revolution put forward by Weber. We argue that the British bureaucratic revolution is reflected in the fact that the state plays an essential role in social change by creating rules and institutions that lastingly orient actors' behavior. The examples of health and local authorities are then used to identify mechanisms that were influential throughout a ten-year period; specifically the introduction of competition features (rewards and punishments) and of auditing and inspection. If our interpretation is accurate, the effects of this bureaucratic revolution may well come to be felt in contexts other than Great Britain.

TI A crime without deviance: workplace theft as a routine activity
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
ID EMPLOYEE THEFT; PUNISHMENT; BEHAVIORS
AB Workplace theft accounts for a considerable mass of crime. Economics and management literature addresses the phenomenon exclusively in terms of how to reduce it, while in sociology literature workplace theft is seen as an act of resistance against workplace injustice. In this article the phenomenon is studied using a "routine activity approach" (a "rational choice" approach used in American criminology) on the basis of a survey of actors in the mass marketing and cleaning sectors. Analyzing workplace theft as routine delinquency leads to seeing it less as deviance from a norm than a function of opportunities and surveillance. Principal-agent and agency costs theory is used to understand how it is that anti-theft surveillance involves not prevention/repression logic but rather tolerance/acceptance of what cannot be overseen. As an example of routine delinquency, workplace theft is less likely to scandalize than it is to be instrumentalized by its victims : employers can use theft as grounds for firing the employee. Lastly, the theoretical issues raised by the routine activity approach are critically discussed.

ID TRUST; EMBEDDEDNESS; QUALITY; NAME
AB The history of the lumbering world in Franche-Comte shows that the different actors in this world share a common interest, reflected in the fact that the job market remains relatively closed. Preserving this optimal collective requires implicating everyone in it in a system of interdependence that regulates who gets contracts as well as flows of new lumbering entrepreneurs (lumberjacks, skidders, foresters). Place within this occupational system, the system that organizes reciprocity between an actor and his occupational world, offers a different perspective on what founds and preserves cooperation. Place is constituted in part by actor's debts and creditor claims. Under certain conditions, place may be transmitted to the following generation.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB Jerome Gautie adopts the viewpoint of an economist to assess the work's contribution to understanding how markets function. But his main point is to examine the approach and propositions of L'economie des singularites in theoretical and methodological terms so as to situate them in relation to "standard" economic theory, economics of conventions, and new economic sociology.
   Jean Gadrey reads L'economie des singularites by situating "singularity" markets [markets for "singular" products and services such as wines and lawyers] within the set of all markets. He highlights the work's useful ordering of coordination arrangements, and praises it for working to renew our understanding of relations between market and culture, in connection with the strategic role assumed by the work of constructing arrangements that will produce the market coordination that then makes trading on the "singularities" market possible.

ID VALUES
AB The social construction of celebrity involves a triangular relationship between personalities, audiences and the media. That relationship is studied here by considering a celebrity any person identified by name and appearing at least once on the cover of the French weekly general news magazine, Paris Match between 1949 and 2005. 85 % of the topics handled by the magazine concern celebrities. The distribution of celebrity scores (measured by number of covers a person appears on) is highly uneven. The celebrity population is described in terms of scores, specialization area, age, sex and nationality. The article then explores the world of values or value conflicts incarnated by these celebrities. It offers a new way of viewing the social changes that occurred over the half-century observed. In the 1950s and 1960s, the as-yet vivid memory in France of the two world wars, France's direct involvement in the wars in Indochina and Algeria, the ongoing feat of conquering space kept the public stirring to the rhythm of la grande histoire, history made of power conflicts and scientific or technological advances. Later, the proportionally stronger presence of aristocrats and show business professionals went along with a strengthened quest for what is first and foremost private well-being, as attested to by increasing interest in the love lives and family life of princesses and actors.

AB This article focuses on the integration of immigrants in France as a demographic, economic, social and political process. It uses data from the 1992 INSEE-INED "Mobilit' Geographique et Insertion Sociale" survey (MGIS). Taking off from literature emphasizing the multidimensional, segmented character of the process, an empirical typology is developed with which to test the relevance of various models. The classic assimilation hypothesis, which assumes the existence of a uniform convergence process, is shown to be validated only in the case of immigrants from Spain. Other, more complex, segmented models seem to characterize the various communities represented in the survey.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
ID 2ND-GENERATION; EDUCATION; HANDICAP; SCHOOL; GIRLS
AB How consistent over time is the ethnic penalty regarding access to the labor market in France? We address this issue considering two cohorts of young people who left school in the last decade of the twentieth century. Our results show that, with educational qualifications kept constant, the penalty remains basically the same over the years for young people of North African origin -who were already experiencing difficulties in the 1980s- in spite of relatively favorable labor market conditions and regardless of the ongoing educational expansion. Two other groups were also subjected to a significant penalty: young people of sub-Saharan African origin and, to a lesser degree, young people of Southeast Asian origin. Over this period, while the improvement of economic conditions benefited most degree-holders, high numbers of young people of North African immigrant origin remained stuck in lower educational positions. The group was overtaken by young people of Portuguese origin, who seem to have gained access to higher educational levels through the extension of vocational education to the lower tertiary level. Such facts would seem to support the idea of "statistical discrimination", a mechanism based on a given group's average characteristics. However, the boundary line between this and more overtly racist discrimination remains indistinct. In any case, the strong feeling of being discriminated against expressed by young people of North African and black African origins, as well as their pessimistic view of the future, reveals a sharp cleavage within French society -a statement that does not hold, however, for young people of Turkish origin. These pessimistic perceptions may also work to amplify a negative dynamic over the longer term, as shown by longitudinal data available on the second cohort. Our results lead to revisiting the "segmented assimilation" theory as elaborated in the American context, referring to a form of racism specific to American society; i.e., racism against the black population of slave descent.

AB Ill-being arises from the multiple interactions that occur in a singularly tense relation - that between an individual endowed with social characteristics and the values and norms imparted and circulated by society. The genders tend to express ill-being in different ways. Women are more likely to be depressed or at risk for suicide, whereas men are more likely to be alcohol-dependent or to commit suicide. Focusing on one of these means of expression only entails the risk of misinterpreting these social phenomena. While divergences between them show the singularities of the various forms that ill-being takes and reveal the differentiated effects they may have on specific populations, convergence works to solidify conclusions applicable to all individuals. On the basis of recent data that take into account the profound changes that have occurred in ways of living in a couple, gendered indicators may be used to develop a new view of women's << overprotection >> from ill-being - protection provided by both the couple and children - which traditionally has preserved women from suicide only.

   statistical modeling applied to Paris middle schools
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
ID EDUCATION; MOBILITY
AB This article studies the determinants of practices for avoiding the school imposed by the French school districting system. The model presented here for Paris middle schools resituates pupil mobility within the competing spaces pupils are enrolled in, without attending to the question of their motivations for enrolling where they do. By examining interaction between pupil characteristics and pupil's position in educational space (i.e., the sectors from which schools actually get pupils and surrounding neighborhoods), the model leads to identifying the social-spatial configurations that work to redistribute pupils toward schools whose profiles better fit their social profiles. Thus integrating different context levels allows for characterizing the social-spatial determinants of inequalities among social categories.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

ID CONTRACTS
AB Pay in the financial industry can be very high, and understanding how it gets determined is a key to understanding, the wage labor nexus. The fact that some employees acquire "hold-up" power is more relevant in explaining this phenomenon than the idea of optimal effort incentives. To better understand the mechanism, an exemplary case of hold-up is studied: two heads of a trading room in a major French bank were granted bonuses of ss10 million and ss7 million respectively for the year 2000 by credibly threatening to leave for a rival bank with their entire teams. The hold-up mechanism can be outlined on the basis of this case: having control over transferable assets makes it possible for employees to threaten to inflict damage on a company if it refuses to accept a contract renegotiation favorable to the employee. The hold-up mechanism is particularly likely to operate if protections against it are weak or ineffective. This leads to viewing the financial industry job market differently, less as a market of persons and personal skills than a market for company assets produced and carried by persons who organize their transfer.

AB Organ donation is a form of human commerce based on solidarity, solidarity impelled by death (generally donor's death and in many case recipient's imminent death). The purpose of this study is to show that the form of donation varies by the material nature of the organ and that it is important riot only to distinguish living or what is here called inter vivos organ donation from post mortem donation but also to take into account whether organ use can be deferred or not. In recent years, original forms of organ donation have appeared -both post mortem and inter vivos- in which economic incentives come increasingly into play. The study analyzes these recent developments in terms of pseudo markets and an "economy of exhortation". It concludes by considering the organizational nature of giving in organ donation.

ID SEGREGATION; RACE
AB Ethnic categories have only gradually come to be used in sociology in France, and the process has been punctuated with acrimonious debate due to how remote such categories are from French intellectual tradition. Use of them has nonetheless attained greater scientific legitimacy because of their sociological relevance, while empirical and linguistic elaboration of them has remained somewhat uncertain and complex. In his presentation of the issue, Georges Felouzis probes the question of the place of ethnic categories in French sociology from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Dominique Schnapper examines the social and democracy-related issues involved in using such categories. Richard Alba and Nancy Denton present the successes and limitations of the use of racial and ethnic categories in the United States. Patrick Simon reflects on how to describe ethnic social relations.

ID MODERNIZATION
AB The modernisation theories developed in the 50s and 60s suggested that societies were converging toward modern values, gradually abandoning their traditional values. This convergence idea is re-examined in the following article within the context of European countries and on the basis of processed Values surveys. A set of attitude scales was constructed and then analysed through multivariate techniques. Two main results emerge from this analysis. First, it appears that, regardless of date and country, the Europeans' values are still structured around a traditionalism axis. This result obviously contradicts the theories of convergence towards modernity, theories that are strongly criticised. It is also an opportunity to reflect on the counterpart of traditionalism -need it be called "modernity"?- and on the relations between economic and moral attitudes. Second, religiosity is strongly linked to this structuring of values but it mainly opposes European members of whatever religious denomination to non-members, rather than -as is often imagined- Catholics to Protestants. All in all, the tension between tradition and modernity remains at the core of the value system of European societies.

AB This article gives an overview of English-language literature in the area of sport and race relations. The recent publication of three studies on the subject is an opportunity for critically assessing how issues, knowledge and theoretical debate have evolved in a field at the intersection of sociology and social history, a field whose academic legitimacy remains relatively low. The analysis makes it clear that sport constitutes a particularly relevant locus for observing the race-related relegation that has been operative for over two centuries in the United States. Local socialclass configurations combine with ethnic and religious membership in subtle ways, making it possible to envisage a relevant research agenda focused on the intersection of the questions of race and sport.

ID SOCIAL-SCIENCES
AB This article examines how Maurice Halbwachs circulated among academic networks in Chicago during his Fall 1930 visiting professorship; specifically, his interactions with sociologists. It is based on Scholarly studies he wrote on his return, family correspondence, and Halbwachs' "Lettres des Etats-Unis", published anonymously in a daily newspaper, the Progres de Lyon. The Durkheimian sociologist was invited to Chicago by the sociologist William F. Ogburn in an attempt to promote quantitative research in the department, which at the time was sharply divided between "case studiers" and "statisticians". The year 1930 was precisely the moment the second group won out against the first, in a complete reorientation of Rockefeller Foundation and University of Chicago policy. Halbwachs did not have great esteem for the work being done by Park, Burgess and their students; their "concrete" and "picturesque" studies were not scientific to his mind, resembling instead the observations of explorers and missionaries, i.e., the raw material that real scholars and researchers -ethnologists and sociologists working in university offices- could then analyze. Halbwachs never thought to question this division of labor.

Four recently published works (three in French, one in English) offer an opportunity to assess how research questions and approaches, knowledge and theoretical debate are evolving in this field, a field that both anthropology and sociology are implicated in. Detailed study of the four works brings to light contrasting positions organized around a set of questions involving relations between the biological and the social, questions raised more than 20 years ago by David M. Schneider, an atypical North American anthropologist unjustly neglected in France. Today Schneider's work seems to have marked a decisive turning point in the recent history of kinship studies.

AB What are the cultural effects of generalized access to high school, which became effective in France in the 1980s and 1990s? Data on reading and television watching suggest that reading is in decline, with readers concentrated among high school and higher education graduates, and that the place of television in the lives of generations who attended school in the 1980s and 1990s is stronger than in earlier generations. These two developments result from a complex combining of the << net >> effect with the structural effect of mass education. Mass education slowed the decline of reading and mitigated the increase in television watching : the proportional weight in the French population of high school and higher education graduates - i.e., those categories most likely to read and least << telephagic >> - has grown at the same time as quantitative levels for both reading and television watching among the highest educated have gradually, over the generations, come to resemble the quantitative reading and television watching levels of the least educated. This dual development may be interpreted in two ways that are not necessarily mutually exclusive : 1) both the decline of reading and the increase in television watching reflect a negative change in the cultural function of schooling [1'Ecole], a change in turn resulting from a transformation of teaching methods and education content relayed by the sharply increased influence of the mass media. But 2) these changes also reflect morphological changes in the world of high school and higher education students : with the generalizing of access to the baccalaureat [French high school leaving degree], the proportion of << heirs >> has considerably fallen. The changes can therefore be read convincingly both as a sign that the school in France has lost a degree of its cultural authority and that cultural gaps have narrowed within the generations implicated in the massification of education.

ID SECONDARY-SCHOOL; QUASI-MARKETS; SEGREGATION; COMPETITION; DIVERSITY
AB Schooling markets and their effects on inequalities have become a special focus for sociology of education. Yet the question remains how to define these << schooling markets >> and provide them with empirical and theoretical content. This article uses economics of quality categories to analyze schooling markets. The analysis, fueled by two empirical studies, one on middle schools and one on high schools, brings to light the characteristics of these markets, how they operate, who the actors are and what effects the markets have on scholastic inequalities. The study's three main results are : I) education is a highly particular commodity characterized by great uncertainty about educational quality and difficulty in obtaining information on quality; also by the fact that all the actors involved are implicated in the functioning of the education quality market; 2) public institution actors are also players on the schooling market, and their action consists in managing pupil flow quantitatively rather than working to explicitly regulate these markets; 3) schooling markets are << feedback >> markets, meaning that as soon as some degree of a given school's educational quality is due to the nature of its pupil population, educational quality at that school - both in terms of schooling effectiveness and quality of school life itself - begins to be defined by the market on this very basis.

TI What is it to become French? Naturalization as a republican
   institutional rite
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB French immigration policy is characterized by a dual movement of restricting new arrivals and facilitating access to French nationality. Over the recent period, the public authorities have focused sharply on naturalization, and this has led to a significant increase in the number of persons naturalized French and to the development of a solemn ceremony for officially granting them their new status (in the form of a written decree). On the basis of a three-year study conducted in a departement of the Paris region, we show that naturalization may be considered a rite of passage that transforms the foreigner into a national after a long selection ordeal, the result of which is celebrated by an integration ceremony but above all it may be considered an institutional rite that brings about a dual separation : 1) out of the sum of immigrants, the ordeal distinguishes those deemed worthy of joining the national community; while 2) the effect of the ceremony itself is to differentiate within the nation those persons who have come from somewhere else. The ambiguity of naturalization thus derives from the fact that at the moment it produces << same >>, it recognizes that << same >> as << other >>, as is brought out by comparing naturalization celebrations observed in prefectures and in city or town halls. Nonetheless, the ritual remains a performative act that brings into existence what is uttered and ties the national community together through the promise of a genuine contract.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB The crisis in recruiting French surgeons is often said - by journalists, politicians, surgeons themselves, etc. - to reflect a << crisis in the vocation >>, itself understood as the logical result of 1 changes affecting the surgery profession (<< judicialization >>, increased malpractice insurance 4 rates, falling purchasing power, etc.). After studying these developments, their context, and their impact on perception of the profession, we bring to light the erroneous reasoning that these common explanations of the crisis are based on. We then show that : 1) what explains the crisis is primarily the restricted admission to medical school that has been in effect in France for the last fifteen years - this largely explains the aging of the professional group; and 2) the fact that the applicants ranking highest on the national competitive medical school entrance examinations have been increasingly less likely to choose surgery is directly related to the increased proportion of women medical students - and not to a << crisis in the vocation >>.

AB There is nothing universal in the nature/culture opposition in which anthropology originated, explains Philippe Descola in Par-dela nature et culture. Outside the West, this naturalist cosmology has never been relevant. While anthropology must aim at the universal, it must also ask whether it is not in fact time to free itself from this opposition, or, to put it in Descola's words, whether anthropology of culture should not in fact << develop and couple up with an anthropology of nature >>.

TI Towards a sociology of relations with nature
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB The thinking presented in Par-dela nature et culture invites sociology to take up the question of humans beings' relations with nature. Sociology is perhaps better disposed to do this than anthropology given what is in fact its strong, spontaneous reluctance to refer to invariants thought of as defining what is specific to humanity. An effect of Descola's book is to suggest the interest for sociology of taking up and further developing Durkheim's thesis that humans perceive their relations with nature << on the image >> of social relations.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
AB Intensive care units and their techniques have considerably altered our attitude towards death as well as the death process - a process that had already been professionalised and medicalised. This study of four intensive care units in France and Britain brings to light the reality of death-related practices and resituates that reality at the core of professional relationships and personal experiences. Study results strongly suggest that the decision to end life is a genuine social construction : far from being purely objective and medical, it is heavily conditioned by context and actors' commitment. The search for professional autonomy and self-regulation has increased the ambivalence of the dying process, already complex because governed by numerous and heterogeneous logics. This study shows that our death depends more on the organization and the culture of the intensive care unit than on our own wishes or those of close relatives.

TI Putting the body back in order: The "professionalization" of medical
   assessment of bodily injury, an activity between knowledge and power
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB The rise in car accidents in France after World War 11 caused bodily injury to members of social groups that had been fairly spared up until then given that the primary victims of mutilating injuries had been military personnel and manual workers. The arrival of these << new victims >> had the effect of << disadjusting >> the prevailing social, economic and political purposes of compensation for such injury in that it << deregulated >> some of the principles implicit in the hierarchical organization of physical and social bodies. Bodily injury appraisal was reformed under pressure from insurance organizations, doctors and magistrates - the three << bodies >> implicated in << professionalizing >> this kind of assessment. Methods were invented for medically assessing bodily injury that are specific to common law and independent of the methods used in other contexts and systems (work accidents, military injuries). Study of what can be understood as a process of putting the body back in order allows us to analyze two central features of such << professionalization >> : first, the plural types of logic propelling the gradual acquisition of institutional legitimacy; second the repercussions of that plurality on the invention of new professional knowledge.

LA French
DT Article
AB The 1993 French legislative elections were the only ones in which candidates were permitted to receive contributions from legal entities; the relevant financial accounts were published in the Journal officiel [rough equivalent of the US Congressional Record]. Those elections constitute an exemplary case for studying the question of relations between money and politics. This article is based on an analysis of the structure and volume of contributions received by 4 880 of the 5 254 candidates for a seat in the French parliament. The analysis brings to light the relevance of the three major candidate profiles that emerged in the second half of the nineteenth century, and allows for qualifying a body of journalistic and academic commentaries that stressed the impact of money on the outcome of those elections.

DT Article
ID COHABITATION; MARRIAGE
AB Instituted in 1999, the Pacs or Civil solidarity pact was addressed both to same-sex couples, for whom it incarnates legal recognition, and to different-sex couples seeking to legally frame their union through an alternative to marriage. Seven years after the Pacs was implemented, an analysis of the legislative text identifies its ambivalences; then the meaning of the text is grasped more fully by sociologically studying how the Pacs is used by contracting parties. Social uses of the pact are far from homogeneous. Analysis of the motivations associated with choosing the Pacs, and of the practices of individuals around this choice, bring to light the polysemy of the new arrangement. Used as an alternative to or substitute for marriage (the latter by same-sex couples who cannot get married), as a means of trying out married life, as a intensified << living together >> arrangement and even as a kind of anti-marriage, the Civil solidarity pact appears a plurivocal arrangement whose meaning lies as much in the diversity of the uses it lends itself to as in the legislative text itself.

AB Certain scientific theories do not win acceptance from common understanding. This is the case for Darwin's theory of evolution. While the characteristics of resistance to it vary by culture - e.g., resistance is not expressed in the same way in France and the United States - resistance is in all cases sustained by more or less implicit specious reasoning. This article, based on in vitro experimentation with 60 subjects, brings to light the beliefs and arguments that impede real diffusion of Darwin's thesis nearly 150 years after publication of On the origin of species.

TI The color of judgment - Discrimination in rulings on cases involving
   offenses against French police officers, 1965-2005
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB There is very little French research on possible discrimination by the French police or judiciary - a surprising state of affairs given how explosive this issue is, as attested by the November 2005 riots. This article analyzes discrimination in criminal and civil cases by defendant's origin; it studies the case files of defendants charged with offenses against police officers and tried in the Paris district court (tribunal de grande instance) between 1965 and 2005. "Maghrebin" and "Black" defendants (classification determined by place of birth and last names) are approximately twice as likely as "European" defendants to be sentenced to prison and they receive longer prison sentences; the police officers involved in these cases are also more likely to sue as private plaintiffs alongside the public prosecutor. Multivariate analysis suggests that judicial system discrimination may be imputable to legal technicalities : the judicial machine overpenalizes its "usual customers", among whom Maghrebins and Blacks are overrepresented. However, when it comes to the police officers' decisions to sue in their own name, racial factors are active in the model.

TI Prostitution in clubs situated in border areas of the Czech Republic
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB The spaces of prostitution that exist in Czech Republic border areas first appeared when the country's borders were opened and are aimed primarily at a German-speaking clientele. They represent an excellent field for studying the social and spatial configurations associated with sale of sexual services. They are also an occasion for reconsidering the questions of how sociology can gain access to a "difficult" field and how to interview actors in or linked to the activity of prostitution. Analysis of the prostitution-related trajectories of the women and customers in these border-area clubs shows that the power relations that develop in them are complex and multiform; it also reveals the high fantasy-generating potential of the social fact of prostitution. Prostitution on the borders of the Czech Republic seems interpretable as an enclosed space where fantasies and affirmations of identity become crystallized.

TI Sociology and positivism in nineteenth-century France: the vicissitudes
   of the Societe de Sociologie (1872-1874)
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB Little is known about how the world's first sociological society, Emile Littre's Societe de sociologie (1872-1874), was formed and operated. This article, based primarily on prosopographic research, offers an interpretation of the society's founding, its political-intellectual orientation and its early demise. As indicated by recruitment and texts by founding members, the Societe de Sociologie was conceived more as a political club than a scholarly or scientific society. Guided by Littre's heterodox positivism and the redefinition of sociology he proposed around 1870, the Society was intended first and foremost to provide intellectual accompaniment for the political changes that Littre considered imperative at the start of the Third Republic. His hopes and expectations did not particularly resonate with Society members at large, and it seems to have been Littre himself and his closest associates who put an end to Society meetings. Some members' general studies on the status and division of the social sciences were further developed in the framework of the journal La philosophie positive (1867-1883), but the authors who were most committed to those studies were positioned on the margins of the Littre network. Neither the dominant republican current of thinking, centered around Littre and Dubost, nor more generalist thinking on sociology by the furthest removed collaborators (Mesmer, Roberty, Vitry) represented an important contribution to academic sociology in France. However, given that the Societe de Sociologie worked to diffuse the project of a sociological science and developed forms of sociology coherent enough to be rejected by the Durkheimians, the group constitutes a significant case of failure in the history of the discipline.

TI Assessing homogeneity in pair formation : similarity and social ties in
   the choice of an aikido partner
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB In situations where it is compulsory to choose a partner from among a limited number of individuals but where selection is not rule-guided, the first question that arises is whether the pairs formed can be thought of as due to "chance" or involved implicit constraints which sociologists' then need to specify. Do people have a tendency to form homogeneous pairs or mixed ones ? The second hypothesis bears on the types of social logic operative in selection : do choices merely reflect a quest for shared identity or do they depend first and foremost on relational and structural constraints ? This problem is part of the more general one of how to measure homogeneity in social relations. To assess homogeneity in a complete set of pairs, it can be worthwhile to move from an approach in terms of disparities (the chi-square measurement, for example) to one in terms of configurations and matching. These measurement methods were applied to observations of an aikido class. In the non-competitive Japanese martial art of aikido, participants form pairs and they change partners regularly. Practitioners of the sport may be characterized on the basis of various criteria : sex, level of skill, age, prior aikido partners, etc. The article concludes with some ideas on the logic of pair formation within the framework of this sport.

TI The construction of collective actors : Francois Sellier revisited
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB On the basis of a volume that collects both texts by Franqois Sellier himself and studies of his work by some of his collaborators at LEST (Laboratoire d'Economie et de Sociologie A Travail), this article seeks to define the originality and seminal value of Sellier's interdisciplinary approach. This approach, operative as well in his work on wage formation, particularly the comparison of wages in France and Germany, as in his discussion of John Dunlop's conception of the industrial relations system, or in his study of health policy, may be stated as follows : social action should be explained not as resulting from decisions made by abstract economic agents endowed with universal rationality, but as resulting from decisions made by concrete collective actors with their historically constructed identities and abilities. Whether we consider the building of industrial organization, the elaboration of skills and classifications, or the development of industrial relations systems, social actors define themselves by defining the rules each uses in its own collective action and the rules they use in the conflict and negotiation between them (what the author calls "confrontation sociale").

AB What does value rationality consist in and how does it fit together with instrumental rationality? Can these problems be elucidated if coordination among social actors in non-market activities is understood to be founded on values that themselves allow for defining common goods ? This article challenges that understanding, recently reformulated by developments in the economics of conventions. Using the very procedures developed in that school of thought - closer analysis of procedural rationality, analysis of coordination and collective arrangements and setups - we seek to answer the question more effectively, by analyzing how norms and normativity themselves develop. Refusing to separate the field of argument from that of interests, strategies and power relations, we analyze the aspect of collective action which cannot be reduced to individual action, an approach which allows for understanding the very nature of normativity.

AB The problematic of how supply and demand meet on a particular market is at the core of the economic sociology project, which for several years has produced detailed analyses of how judgments of the quality of products and service providers are constructed prior to the exchange relation. Observation of how funeral business services come to be purchased and analysis of competition dynamics on local funeral service markets bring to light certain alternative ways of organizing the marketplace encounter. The article describes the devices used to capture this market, particularly the socio-technical arrangements for channeling customers toward a single service provider. It shows the degree to which provider activity, relations among competitors, and the market regulation game in this sector are structured by the production of an economy of customer capture.

ID EDUCATION; OPPORTUNITY; INEQUALITY; EXPANSION
AB This article offers a critical analysis of four contemporary sociological debates. Systematic analysis of the relevant literature suggests the existence of a project for reformulating the methodological foundations of empirical quantitative sociology. This reconstruction shows the emergence of the following idea: an alliance of variable analysis, mechanism methodology, and simulation techniques would be of great help in resolving some of the impasses that "standard" empirical quantitative sociology encounters. This thesis is then tested for quantitative sociology of social stratification: where there are "irrefutable signs" that the idea is becoming acceptable. Lastly, a link is established between these recent debates and older, similar proposals for resolving the problem, and the question of why the soundness of these proposals has only recently been recognized is examined.

TI The shift from "good student" to "serious business manager", or how to
   become an "HEC"
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB Pierre Bounlieu showed how France's grandes ecoles produce its "state nobility", the "structural heir" to the nobility of the Ancien Regime. His ethnographic descriptions pertain primarily to the first part of that production process; i.e., how France's preparatory schools prepare students for nationwide competitive exams for admission into the grandes ecoles. This article considers how the second part of the process operates within one of those schools : the Hautes Etudes Commerciales or HEC [France's most prestigious and selective business school]. The results of a survey conducted in that institution indicate that the teaching approach particular to HEC consists in "de-scholasticizing" its students (who had to be scholastically strong in order to be admitted) and instructing them instead in how to "play the manager", thereby converting the quality of being a "good student" into "managerial seriousness". Modes and pace of the process vary by student's social origin and trajectory.

TI Social capital and profits among small construction contractors : the
   weight of socio-technical uncertainty.
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB The profitability of small construction businesses depends in part on their social capital; a company's relations determine its opportunities for finding more or less advantageous job contracts. The link between profitability and social network is not easy to measure, however, because social capital implies constraints as well as advantages. How and under what conditions does a company s social network improve its profit margin ? Ronald Burt's structural holes theory predicts that an entrepreneur's performance will increase systematically with social network porosity. The article argues from a socio-technical, strategic analysis perspective that the return on social capital is conditioned by the nature of jobs and by interdependence. Comparison of companies with different technical specializations shows that loose business networks are more likely to profit relatively specialized companies working independently on construction sites while cohesive networks are beneficial for companies likely to be affected by socio-technical uncertainty.

TI Judgments of legitimacy and illegitimacy: Normative life in the new
   Chinese workplaces
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB This article analyzes the emergence of labor regulations in the new types of businesses being developed in China today. It studies both the internal codes and regulations established by employers and the legitimacy and illegitimacy judgments expressed when these regulations are implemented. The information collected pertains to privately operated Chinese factories, Chinese factories under contract to foreign businesses, and factories whose owners come from Hong Kong or Taiwan but have handed over factory management to an entirely mainland-Chinese workforce. These three types of business have in common the fact of not fitting into either the industrial system that has been in place for several decades in state and collectively run Chinese businesses or the various but well-established management modes imported by foreign businesses into China. Two ways were observed of legitimating the highly detailed but often unstable prescriptions that make up these internal regulations: political categories are used to try to legitimate factory managers' authority and what is expected of employees; the validity of certain rules is affirmed by merely citing their efficiency, i.e., that they help keep the business running smoothly, though what that means is not further explained. However, interpretation and implementation of these prescriptions give rise to highly diverse judgments of illegitimacy, judgments based on moral principles. These judgments are expressed by migrant employees -many of whom have acceded to supervisorial posts and are therefore called upon to apply the rules- and they foster the emergence of shared ways of doing things. Rules and regulations are thus gradually being developed in the observed factories, determined not only by unilateral prescriptions of the sort some bosses seek to impose, but also by the validity-testing that migrant employees practice on a daily basis.

TI Fishes and ponds : multi-level network analysis.
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
ID PRODUCTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; SCIENCE
AB This article proposes a neo-structural approach to the multi-level dimension of organizational and social life. Our study explores multi-level networks that observe two systems of superposed and partially interlocked interdependencies, the first being inter-organizational, the second inter-individual. We propose a method of structural linked design as an articulation for these levels. The method is composed of two major steps : first, we separately examine the complete networks at the two different levels. Second, we articulate the two networks in relation to one another using systematic information about the membership of each individual in the first network (inter-individual) to one of the organizations in the second network (inter-organizational). This dual-positioning, or the linked design approach, is carried out in an empirical study examining performance variations within the "elite" of French cancer research in 1999. By looking at measures of centrality, we identify the actors that these top researchers consider as central or peripheral at the inter-individual level (the big and the little fish among the elite), and the laboratories that the research directors consider as central or peripheral at the inter-organizational level (the big and the little ponds among all the laboratories conducting cancer research in France at that time). In addition to the rather trivial report of the competitive advantage of big fish in big ponds (particularly because of the advantage of size for laboratories in this domain of research), we use measurements of scientific performance to identify "catching up" strategies that the smallest fish use in this system. We suggest that this method offers new insights into the multilevel dimension of complex systems of interdependencies, and also into the way in which actors manage these interdependencies. We believe that this understanding adds a new dimension to the sociological exploration of the determinants of performance, of meso-level phenomena such as institutional change, or macro-level phenomena such as social inequalities.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
ID CRIME; VICTIMIZATION
AB Using both quantitative and qualitative analysis (data from the Enquete Nationale sur les Violences Envers les Femmes survey and in-depth ad hoc interviews), this article explores the relationship between women's fears for their safety, the experience of victimization, and women's mobility in public places -three phenomena rarely dealt with in combination. While relatively few women spontaneously say they are afraid to go out alone, study of their actual practices and the content of their discourse enables us to qualify this assessment. In fact, many women, married, living with a partner, or with little or no free time due to the sexual division of labor, do not have to deal with the question of going out alone at night. Moreover, analysis of the practices of women who go out alone at night suggests that doing so involves maintaining strong mental vigilance, a condition revealed in their many tactics for avoiding contact. Mental vigilance is particularly strong among women who have been victims of violence. Women's mobility does not seem hampered by having been assaulted or otherwise harassed in a public place. However, violence of any kind, even the most apparently harmless or inconsequential, limits women's freedom of movement in that it carries with it a threat felt over and beyond the moment it occurs, and increases what many women say is their fear of being alone in public space.

AB The law on bioethics passed by the French parliament in 2004 qualifies reproductive cloning as a "crime against the human species", a clear indication of how threatened the social world feels by certain aspects of genetic engineering. This article analyses the many social issues involved in cloning. The field of bioethics constitutes a kind of open-air laboratory for anyone interested in studying norm formation processes in pluralist societies. Among other things it brings to light the intertwining of axiological or value-focused controversies and economic logic. After specifying what cloning is, the article reviews the stages through which the prospect of reproductive cloning as both reality and fantasy has become a focus of public debate. It then examines the main arguments for and against reproductive cloning, paying particular attention to arguments that refer to the danger cloning represents for the social tie (a blow to the principles of filiation, the resurgence of eugenics, etc.). Lastly, the article looks at the difficulties encountered when attempts are made to formulate a prohibition at the national and international levels. The conclusion seeks to demonstrate how certain biologists' discourse on cloning represents a strong invitation for greater dialogue between the life sciences and sociology.

ID TRENDS; POLICY
AB While sociology and political science have often taken up the theme of civilian-military relations in non-democratic regimes, the specificity of those relations in democratic systems has not been fully examined. The finding of this critical review of research is that studies analyzing the impact that changes in military activity have had on civilian-military relations or the role of the military in decision-making processes fail to fully account for those relations, whereas more recent studies, attentive to the political factors operative in those relations, can open new research avenues - on condition that we move beyond exclusive focus on relations between civilian governments and the military and take into account the role of defense policies in determining the status granted to military within the state.

ID MODERNIZATION
AB The modernization theories developed in the 1950s and 60s put forward the idea that societies were converging toward modern values and gradually abandoning their traditional values. Using data from the Values surveys, the article reexamines the convergence idea in the context of European societies. A set of attitude scales was constructed, then analyzed using multivariate techniques. Analysis yielded two main results. First. regardless of date or country examined, Europeans' values seem still to be structured around a traditionalism axis. This result obviously runs counter to convergence-toward-modernity theses, theses which have already been strongly criticized. It is also a reason to reflect on the counterpart of traditionalism - need it be called << modernity >> ? - and the ties between economic and moral attitudes. Second, religiosity is seen to be closely linked to this way of structuring values, but the relevant opposition is between Europeans affiliated with a religion whatever it may and persons with no religion, rather than (as is often imagined) between Catholics and Protestants. All in all, the tension between tradition and modernity persists at the core of European societies' value system.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
AB Using data from the 1981 and 1999 European Values Surveys, the article first shows that it is still meaningful to people to identify themselves as being on the right or left. These political identities are relative, nuanced, plural, but they extend beyond national borders : the same relations between values and the right-left scale - though they may be more or less strong - are observed throughout Western Europe. The article then shows that political identities are linked to religious ones and that these two facets of the constructed individual have complex combined effects on many values. But generation and educational attainment can also be highly relevant in accounting for the world of values. In an individualized Europe, values are many and they tend to be cobbled together, but there is some regulation of individual preferences.

TI Secularization : a European exception ? A return to the concept and
   discussions of it in sociology of religion.
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Review
ID MODERNITIES
AB The concept of secularization has long been a central interpretative paradigm in sociology of religion, one which designates in various ways a process of religion losing social influence in modern societies. Despite ideological connotations wherein the advance of modernity is associated with a fall in of religion, and despite the fact that the United States fits poorly into this schema, the paradigm was empirically validated by European data showing a decline in religious belonging. This did not prevent critical discussion of the concept from developing in the 1960s, discussion in which some went so far as to declare secularization a << sociological myth >>. The paradigm has been still more sharply questioned and criticized since the 1990s, and there is greater willingness these days to speak of a << European exception >> than an American one. The article examines these discussions, concluding with a reformulation of the concept which reflects the idea that in contemporary ultramodernity modern secularization is associated with a reconfiguring of religion and religiosity.

TI Moral attitudes, economic attitudes and political orientation in Europe.
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB The increase in the number of major international surveys in the last few years provides data well adapted for use by sociologists of cultural change. This article uses the 1999 European Values Survey to analyze how Europeans' moral and economic attitudes are organized, and what connections obtain between those attitudes and political orientation. For moral attitudes, we observe the existence of three scales, the first bearing on mores; the second on behavior that attests to what I propose to call social selfishness, while the third is the basis for opinions expressed on types fraud involving money. Economic opinions prove less strongly structured than moral attitudes and are often out of step with the kinds of analysis used in economics, at least the form of economics most common today. Scales of this type were first used in relation to political orientation in France twenty years ago. Though the relations are not as strong, they are confirmed at the European level, despite the cultural heterogeneity of this continent. In France, while the link between economic attitudes and political orientation seems to have weakened in the twenty years, it endures for positions on questions involving mores.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

AB In this article, we analyse two questions : 1) the central components of national identity; 2) the relationship between national and European orientation. The empirical analysis of this study is based on the module << National Identity II 2003 >> of the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP), carried out in 21 European countries. In theoretical discussions, a distinction is often made between the concept of state nation and ethnic or cultural nation. The factor analysis as well as the multi-level regression, however, show that these concepts are not distinct in the minds of the general public. Elements of both concepts are equally important. Particularly more traditional social groups (women, elderly, Catholics) support both concepts. They are also determined by country specific structural and institutional characteristics. Furthermore, we found a complementary relationship between local, regional, national and European orientation. However, the attachment to the nation is much stronger than to Europe.

ID ASSIMILATION; FRANCE
AB Do immigrants hold values specific to them ? This critical review begins by questioning the validity of the question itself and considering the ambiguities that weigh on the categories it refers to : immigrants, Francais issus de l'immigration [French descendants of immigrants], Francais de souche [French of French origin], etc. A comparison between the French case and other European societies with large immigrant populations shows that the question is closely linked to national political orientations on citizenship : underlying it is the question of immigrants' eligibility to belong to the national community, and of the place they are to hold in that community, which varies by whether the community is defined as pluricultural or culturally homogeneous. The second part examines a set of French research studies on the values held in various areas (family life, types of socializing, work, religion, political life, etc.) of young descendants by North African immigrants over the last 30 years. The review brings to light regularities that were firmly established by the major statistical surveys (e.g., young descendants of this immigrant population are firmly positioned on the political left), while qualitative research more clearly brings out variability of orientations by actor's socialization itinerary. The conclusion underlines the need to fit together the two types of approach and further develop international comparison, particularly within the European framework.

AB Change in norms, values and institutions can be made more intelligible by synthesizing some of the fundamental intuitions of Tocqueville, Durkheim and Weber. These intuitions allow for formulating a theory of moral change that is not affected by the difficulties that theories inspired by culturalist and neo-Darwinian evolutionist thinking run into. The conception of rationality operative in these intuitions, namely by way of Weber's distinction between << value rationality >> and << instrumental rationality >>, is a crucial feature of this theory, a theory that makes it possible to account for a range of qualitative macroscopic information and quantitative survey data while clarifying contemporary discussions on the << clash of civilizations >> and the future of cultural diversity.

AB Most studies of the values of Europeans and Americans conclude that recent developments reflect an increasingly strong affirmation of individualism. The question arises, however, whether the real change is not instead to be located << upstream >>, in the opening up of reason to acknowledgment of the other's reasons. Data from the 1981, 1990 and 1999 editions of the World Values Survey were used to test this hypothesis. After synthesizing the data in accordance with the seven survey theme areas (lifestyles, civic-mindedness, social selectiveness, religion, work, family and education), we examined congruence between these units and our model. We also tested competing models; namely postmaterialism, << return to authority >>, and modernity as the only rational world. In the final analysis, the << advance of reasonableness >> thesis proved more general and parcimonious than the others as a means of accounting for value trends in Western Europe and the United States from 1980 to 2000.

ID VALUE PRIORITIES; BEHAVIOR; CHOICE
AB Applying the values construct in the social sciences has suffered from the absence of an agreed-upon conception of basic values, of the content and structure of relations among these values, and of reliable methods to measure them. This article presents data from over 70 countries, using two different instruments, to validate a theory intended to fill part of this gap. It concerns the basic values that individuals in all cultures recognize. The theory identifies 10 motivationally distinct values and specifies the dynamics of conflict and congruence among them. These dynamics yield a structure of relations among values common to culturally diverse groups, suggesting an universal organization of human motivations. Individuals and groups differ in the priorities they assign to these values. The article examines sources of individual differences in value priorities and behavioral and attitudinal consequences that follow from holding particular value priorities. In doing so, it considers processes through which values are influenced and through which they influence action.

ID OCCUPATIONAL MOBILITY; SOCIOLOGICAL MODELS; ELECTORAL-BEHAVIOR
AB This article studies the political consequences of intergenerational downward mobility among wage-earners. The first focus of the analysis is effects of downward mobility on values and political attitudes. In this connection, analysis of Panel Electoral Francais 2002 data (Cevipof-Cecop-Cidsp) brings out the strength of the << position >> effect : for three out of the four dimensions studied (ethnocentrism, authoritarianism, economic liberalism), the downwardly mobile are likely to adopt the attitudes characteristic of the group they are moving into. However, in the case of social preoccupation, an << origin >> effect is found, strongly suggesting an original reconstruction of the downwardly mobile's axiological world as a whole. The second part analyzes the effects of downward trajectories on position in political space. In the framework of a three-part political space, the aforementioned original reconstruction of the value system is reflected in a particular political positioning, and for stated political preference, downward mobility has its own effect : a relatively strong attraction to the extreme right. Two hypotheses are developed to explain this result : the feeling of relative deprivation that goes with downward mobility, and the original reconstruction of social and economic discourse by the << diclassis >>.

AB Organs gift giving is a commerce between human beings : this commerce entails a solidarity related to death. The purpose of this study is to disentangle the various forms of gift that are at work in this most modern form of gift. The nature of the organ, on the one hand, and immediate or delayed transplantation on the other, are instrumental for distinguishing gifts. However, the present situation of shortage has given raise to the multiplication of original forms of gift and has opened the door to financial incentives, whether the gift is an inter vivos or a post mortem gift. These recent developments in the field of transplantation are considered in term of pseudo-markets and the economy of exhortation. In conclusion, the study emphasizes the organizational nature of this modern gift giving process.

ID SOCIOLOGY; SPENCER
AB In his early texts, Durkheim cited and made extensive use of the life sciences, including naturalist theses tinged with ethnocentrism and sexism. The apparent contradiction between this biology-marked argumentation and the more numerous and more frequently commented on texts in which he firmly criticized ethnocentrism and biological reductionism in sociology recedes as soon as we reconstitute the general field of thought specific to the biology-inspired sociology of the period in which he was developing his views. Returning to the early Durkheim's biological and naturalist sources, sources often neglected or euphemized in commentaries, also brings out an original aspect of his first texts : it was, in his view, perfectly possible to claim the epistemological autonomy of social facts without having to accept the idea that the individual mind was entirely fashioned by society. Furthermore, the investigation reveals by contrast certain aspects of the way a part of today's social sciences view their relations with today's and yesterday's life sciences.

AB Though historians of sociology have often cited the survey of unemployment conducted from 1935 to 1937 by the Institut Scientifique de Recherches Economiques et Sociales headed by Charles Rist, they have never analyzed that survey. In many respects - subject matter, theoretical protocol, implementation - this study seems a major landmark on the path between interwar Durkheimian sociology and the post-1945 refounding of the discipline. It is one of the few attempts to synthesize the objectivist approach of Durkheimian tradition and the kind of field work represented by the Le Play school, work which the survey designers sought to perfect. The synthesis failed, and the economic perspective dominates the survey. This paradoxical situation meant that the approach could not stand as a real model for the post-1945 generation of sociologists; however, it did demonstrate the need to improve the direct survey method.

AB This article examines how Maurice Halbwachs circulated among University of Chicago networks during his autumn 1930 stay there, particularly his interactions with sociologists. It is based on the scientific articles he wrote when he returned, correspondence with his family, and his << Lettres des Etats-Unis >>, published anonymously in the Progres de Lyon newspaper. The Durkheiman sociologist was invited to the University of Chicago by the William F. Ogburn, a promoter of quantitative studies in a sociology department then deeply divided between partisans of << case study >> sociology and partisans of << statistics >>. 1930 was precisely the year the statistics side won out and funding policy of the University authorities and the Rockefeller Foundation was entirely reoriented. Halbwachs had little esteem for the works of Park, Burgess and their students; what he called their << concrete >> and << picturesque >> studies were in his view not science, but comparable instead to the observations provided by explorers and missionaries that then served as material for real savants, sedentary scholar ethnologists. It did not occur to Halbwachs that this division of labor could be called into question.

AB For some years now in France and the Anglo-Saxon countries, kinship has been eliciting greater interest and new analyses. The recent publication of four texts, three in French, one in English, is an occasion to assess how research problematics, knowledge, and debate have been evolving in this field that partakes of both anthropology and sociology. Detailed analysis of the texts shows that the various contrasting positions are organized around a set of questions concerned with biology and the social, questions raised more than twenty years ago by David M. Schneider, an atypical North American anthropologist little known in France. Schneider's work appears today as a decisive turning point in the recent history of kinship studies.

TI Second generations on the labor market in France : an enduring ethnic
   penalty. Contribution to segmented assimilation theory
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
ID 2ND-GENERATION; EDUCATION
AB This article examines the strength over time of the ethnic penalty in hiring in France for two cohorts of young people who left school in the last decade of the twentieth century. The results show that for equal educational degrees, the penalty affecting the Maghrebin group, who were already in difficulty in the 1980s despite a temporary fall in unemployment and continued democratizing of the school system, did not change substantially. The penalty was also significant for two other groups : young people of sub-Saharan African origin and, to a lesser degree, young people of Southeast Asian origin. During this period the improving economic context was more favorable to degree-holding applicants than others, while children of Maghrebin immigrants were still numerically more likely to have low qualifications. Young people of Portuguese origin, who seem to have advanced upon expansion of vocational specialization programs into higher education, pulled ahead of the Maghrebin group and they are from now ahead. This may strengthen the hypothesis of << statistical discrimination >>, a mechanism based on a group's average characteristics. The borderline between statistical discrimination and more overtly racist discrimination remains unclear, however. The strong feeling of being discriminated against that is expressed by young people whose parents immigrated from North Africa or Black Africa, together with their pessimistic vision of the future, are indications of a serious split running through French society, though this does not affect the Turkish group. These perceptions may also work to accentuate a negative long-term dynamic, as shown by available longitudinal data on the second cohort. The results compel a rereading of the << segmented assimilation >> theory. as developed in an American context in reference to racism toward a black population - descendants of slaves - specific to American society.

ID INCREASING RETURNS; BEHAVIOR; DYNAMICS; FADS
AB The aim of this article is to explain the successive processes of constructing and deconstructing geographic proximity and collective identity that characterized the brief history of << Silicon Sentier >>, main locus of the << net economy >> in Paris during the time of the internet bubble. We refute the understanding that Silicon Sentier was the result of a multitude of mutually independent individual decisions to set up in business there linked to the economic characteristics of the territory, showing instead how the mimetic processes that played a role in the making of these decisions and how they were aggregated brought about the emergence of a norm for where to locate one's business; that is, a territory bringing together a significant number of sector actors and conferring legitimacy on them in the eyes of the environment. Moreover, the nature of these mimetic processes makes it possible to illustrate and analyze the stability characteristics of the district.

TI Fair trade : market exchange against and within the market
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
ID EMBEDDEDNESS
AB The article presents the project and practices of fair trade in light of Max Weber's opposition between formal and substantive rationality. Promoters of fair trade share the purpose of substantively rationalizing the market (paying a << fair price >>, working with << small producers >>, knowing the << producers behind the products >>). However, tensions make themselves felt as soon as they also try to increase their sales and take on their competitors. Observation of various fair trade product categories shows that, in keeping with Weber's analysis, substantive rationality becomes increasingly difficult to apply as this form of trade comes to participate more fully in the market order.

TI Hold-up in finance. The conditions of possibility of high bonuses in
   financial industry
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
ID CONTRACTS
AB Compensations in financial industry are sometimes very high and the comprehension of their mode of formation is a key for the comprehension of the wage labor nexus. The fact that some employees gain the power to make hold-ups constitutes a better explanation than optimal incentive to make efforts. An exemplary case of hold-up enables us to understand its mechanism. Two heads of a dealing room of a large bank were granted ten and seven million euros of bonus for the year 2000 as they threat to leave to rival bank with their entire team. This case makes it possible to outline the mechanism of hold-up : the control of transferable assets enables to threaten the firm of damages if she does not accept a favorable renegotiation for the employee. This mechanism is all the more frequent as protections are relatively inefficient. As a result, we draw a different view of the financial labor market : less like a market of persons and personal competences than like a market of firms' assets, collectively produced and carried by people who organize their transfer.

TI Radical academicism, or the sociologist's monologue: Who are radical
   sociologists talking with?
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB Since the early 1990s, a very successful approach has developed in sociology in France called "radical academicism". It involves the sociologist identifying himself or herself with an "objectivity" external to society (and incarnated by the institution). and it leads to a kind of elitism: only an elite made up of "savants" can accede to the lucidity offered by theory and universal values: only its members escape social determinism and can perceive such determinism at work in the lives of others. This elite. then. ends up speaking a monologue and establishing its "self" as the point of intersection between science and the political, meaning - so goes the argument - that it is in a position to "show" the dominated the real meaning of their actions. In addition to the advantages it offers. this position resonates with the social experience of "intellos precaires" [persons working in the intellectual professions in France whose socio-economic situation remains unsure, "precarious": e.g., adjuncts]. who can therefore consider their own "misere" comparable to the "suffering" of the most underprivileged members of society. thereby universalizing their own interests. Radical academicism goes together with sharp hostility to democracy. and its mixture of self-pity and critical distance may also be said to characterize middle class ideology. At the political level. radical academicism exemplifies middle-class appropriation of what was once the world of working-class demands. and middle-class power to weaken working-class defenses.

ID ASSIMILATION; DETERMINANTS; MODES
AB This article focuses on the integration of immigrants in France as a demographic, economic, social and political process. It uses quantitative methods, and statistical data from a 1992 INSEEINED survey entitled << Mobiliti Giographique et Insertion Sociale >> (MGIS; Geographic mobility and social integration). Taking off from literature stressing the multidimensional, segmented character of the immigrant integration process, the research worked to develop an empirical typology of that process that would allow for testing the relevance of various models. It shows that the classic integration hypothesis, which posits the existence of a uniform convergence process, is only validated for the case of Spanish immigrants. The other communities represented in the survey seem characterized by more complex and further segmented models.

ID VICTIMIZATION RATES; CRIME; FEAR; RISK
AB The article seeks to demonstrate that the sudden rise in preoccupations with security and law and order at the time of the 2002 elections in France cannot be explained solely by circumstantial factors but reflects instead a profound transformation in these concerns. After the relevance and limitations of an analysis in purely circumstantial terms is shown. the main demonstration is constructed around the distinction that has been developed between fear and preoccupation. Data from a survey conducted with near-annual regularity from 1977 to 2002 are then used to demonstrate how Security preoccupations have become repatterned since the mid-nineties in such a way that an autonomous version of this type of concern is now to be found in social groups previously reluctant to adopt an attitude of concern about security. The last part of the article discusses the import of the results obtained: How should they be interpreted. and how can they be expected to affect security policy?

DT Article
ID SCHOOLS
AB Using PISA 2000 data, this study presents an international comparison of the way social origin influences reading comprehension performances, looking at a variety of variables, some external to the school system, others internal. A variable's effect is strong in proportion to the strength of its association to father's occupation and degree to which it favors performance. The study uses the method of path analysis to distinguish between these two aspects. The French situation is presented, then compared to twelve other European Union countries. In all countries, social origin influences performance much more strongly through external variables than variables internal to the educational system : the data used demonstrate that quality of teaching varies little by pupils' social origin. The article draws theoretical conclusions from the comparison concerning resistance of traditional forms of social advantage, as well as practical consequences regarding choice of variables to act on in order to diminish the effect of social origin on scholastic performance.

AB This study, based on on-site observation and interviews with mail handlers and managers employed by the French postal service La Poste. was conducted to improve knowledge of the alcohol consumption and alcoholism-related practices specific to this occupational milieu. Neither of these sets of practices can be studied in isolation from mail handier socializing and practices of mutual support in the workplace, or from the social oversight practices that regulate routine production activity: specifically. the requirement that managers report "intemperate mail workers". Analysis of the interdependence between routine work and alcohol consumption practices sheds light on why managers often show a passive attitude despite regulations requiring them to report "alcoholic" mail handlers.

TI Comparative advertising, or how to take the law into one's own hands
   with the help of the law
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Review
ID INFORMATION; CONSUMER; MARKET; ECONOMICS
AB Comparative advertising implicates more than just the business that uses it and the competitor(s) it designates; it also involves the law, which serves as supporting ground and frame for the confrontation between the two. By enabling businesses to << take the law into their own hands with the help of the law >>, comparative advertising activates joint, constant redefining of the economic practice of advertising and the rules purporting to frame it. Redefinition is generated by a chronological series of three hesitations. The first is historical and concerns regulators, who gradually decided to incorporate the notion of comparative advertising into economic regulations while considerably limiting the practice. The second is strategic, and concerns businesses : when a business tries to assess whether or not it would be to its advantage to engage in comparative advertising, it is exploring at least two ways of playing with the law : either comparing its product with a fictitious competitor's to avoid having to deal with the law, or else resolutely situating itself inside the legal framework, as if the actors were trying to make the law function as a seal of approval in spite of itself. The third hesitation is social in character and involves actors' hesitations, those of plaintiffs, lawyers and the judge : their task is to accommodate the ambiguities inherent in the other two hesitations. The article examines a particular case of jurisprudence by which it shows the degree to which comparative advertising leads the judge to compromise with both legal rules and economic givens. Use of comparative advertising thus delimits a space of collective experimentation in which economic actors are able continuously to test, bolster, or redefine the norms and practices of market exchange.

AB The 1981 and 1990 European Values Surveys showed a decline for almost all religious variables, a decline even sharper among young people. except for belief in an afterlife. The younger the respondents. the less religious they were likely to be. These results confirmed the thesis of increasing secularization in Europe and the West. However. the most recent. 1999 survey shows this downward trend to be counterbalanced by two other tendencies: internal Christian renewal and increased "believing without belonging". both phenomena that are clearly more developed among young people. The respective strengths of these three developments vary by country surveyed. The same phenomena are even more pronounced in Eastern European (former communist bloc) countries and in Russia. once again particularly among young people. The changes may be interpreted as a turning point after the break with religiosity that characterized the 1960s and 70s.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB in contrast to the abundant Anglo-American literature, little research exists in France on defense policy in general and arms procurement decisions in particular. If we seek to import models from the English-language literature, we are led to investigate the presence of a << military-industrial complex >> in France. Through the study of a specific armament policy, the development and production of the Leclerc main battle tank, we rule out the existence of a << conscious, coherent, and conspiratorial >> elite. Behind this program, we do indeed find an elite group, but its existence is a result of the program itself. Due to the cold war context and the Gaullist policy of national autonomy, a group of actors benefit ed from relative autonomy to set down the bases of a belief in the necessity and possibility of building the best tank in the world. The program and the elite group that sponsored it reinforced each other and succeeded in sustaining the Leclerc project after the end of the cold war context that had initially justified it. The formation of programmatic elites of this kind is one of the characteristics of the new democratic governance.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
ID COPING STRATEGIES; LIFE-CYCLE; COUPLES
AB In the 1970s and 1980s, a number of studies brought to light a variety of family interaction styles characteristic of contemporary societies. Which of them have lasted? How are they related to the social structure? What problems and conflicts are they likely to bring about? This article aims to answer those questions on the basis of a large representative Sample indicating couples' social and generational characteristics. Five styles were empirically identified, associated with sharply varied frequency levels for problems and open conflict. Prevalent conjugal conflict coincides with a strong tendency for spouse or partner autonomy. sex-differentiated roles. and couple self-enclosure. These results are largely due to the differential effect of the conflict-management modes inherent in the various interaction styles. these in turn influenced by couples' social characteristics and position. No increasing standardization of conjugal interaction modes was observed: indeed. advanced modernity seems characterized instead by several fairly distinct models highly dependent on position in the social structure.

AB The article analyzes the particular case of early music concerts as a prototype market. It first presents an ideal-typical definition of the prototype. which it then uses to bring to light the prototypical character of early music concerts. It then shows how this concert market and the main mode of marketing concerts (organizing a concert tour) is based on competition mechanisms and exchange logic that vary by whether transactions are with regular or sporadic partners.

TI Action, order and culture: elements for a Weberian research program
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB Weberian research program can be developed in critical relation with three major theoretical constructions : Luhmann's systems theory, Habermas' communicative action theory, and the rational choice theory of action based on the maximum utility calculation. The basis of such a program is the theory of rule-governed action, constructed around the key notions of meaning, understanding, reciprocity and double contingency, multidimensional analysis, and the idea of an actor who is able to speak and act. Considered this way, the concept of " rational action " cannot be reduced to mere utilitarian rationality - that would be to disregard the importance Weber attributed to value rationality - nor would it give priority to an approach in terms of communication and cognition. Analysis of social relations in their differentiated and coordinated forms would necessarily take into account processes of disparity and struggle. Lastly, social action cannot be understood if it is not related to the human actor's ability to position himself in relation to the world and confer meaning on it i.e., to be a " Kulturmensch ".

ID WEBER,MAX
AB The critical edition of Max Weber-Gesamtausgabe gave rise to much research by German scholars which anyone involved in interpreting Weberian constructs must be aware of in order to avert serious misinterpretation. It especially holds true regarding Economy and society, taken to be Max Weber's opus magnum, which proves to consist of various manuscripts Weber wrote at different periods, using, for each one, specific conceptual constructs. Therefore every thorough study of these constructs and of their interpretation must be grounded on the results of this editorial and philological research. Our present paper is mainly concerned with the first phase (1909-1914) of this unfinished undertaking.

TI The theological moment in Weber's approach to social action
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB The study Weber undertook in The protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism is related to the reflexive and argumentative resources (the mental disposition) that constitute the foundation of social action. This explains the importance of his attention to a theological " operator " (analysis of the theological content of the Lutheran Reformation). By linking the theme of personal salvation to that of world salvation, Luther destabilized what were the most meaningful criteria of social recognition; by bolstering the theme of predestination already present in Luther's thinking but much less salient, Calvin, in a harsh way whose effect was to force believers into asceticism, linked social action to an overall view from which " the other " could not be excluded. Weber's attention to the theological operator and the labor of reflexive thinking it elicited sheds light on the development of capitalism based on rationally organized labor, its various detours as well as the gradual process by which it became autonomous from theology - that is modern capitalism, which acquired its coherence from contemporary economic theories continuous with Adam Smith's. Have these theories now acquired a degree of authority that we may henceforth neglect the historical confrontation between the economy and the theological operator ? Have they drawn the definitive contours. of our Gehause ? The question Weber puts at the end of his study continues to exercise us.

AB Weber's thinking on the historical specificity of western capitalism was part of a far-reaching research undertaking that was not only sociological and economic in character but also focused on the law. While his sociological interpretations of capitalism in terms of interrelations among economy, culture. and religion tic well known, his work also bears traces of the meticulous studies of the legal history of the medieval economy he did as part of his university training. This research material unquestionably influenced the development of his theoretical thinking in his last writings, as may be seen in the concepts of " communitarization " (Vergemeinschaftung) and " societization " (Vergesellschaftung) that he used to investigate forms of social relations.

AB Misinterpretation of Weber's antipsychologism has led in turn fit the mistaken idea that in his theory of social action, emotion determined action is nothing more than a detective form of purposive rational action. In fact. given that for Weber sociological explanation necessarily involved understanding the motivations for action. the point for him was to delimit the field of the, << understandable >> and determine the epistemological and methodological status of the << understanding >> undertaking. To do this, lie closely examined all the disciplines of his time - experimental psychology, psychiatry and psychopathology, even psychoanalysis whose research aim was to discover the nature and role of psychic factors, It was through this critical study. which took up questions as complex as relations between the psychic and the somatic. the role of heredity, and even what a sociopathological interpretation of culture would be. that he defined the place and status of what he termed "psychological understanding ".

DT Article
AB A hasty reading of << Marginal utility theory and "the fundamental law of psychophysics">> (1908) might suggest that Weber was criticizing the idea that psychophysics could make any contribution whatsoever to sociological studies and that tie favored instead a version of anthropology based on the marginalist homo oeconomicus model. In fact, though Weber rejected the idea that psychophysics could he it foundational science, tie did outline a possible role for it. alongside marginalist economics, in explaining the complex causality of human action.

AB Carl Menger ( 1840-1921). founder of the Austrian School, transformed economic value theory by showing that price formation is explained not by production costs the labor-value relation of classic liberal economics : Smith and Ricardo) but rather the individual's subjective sense of the utility of the last unit of the desired commodity. This marginal value theory (Grenznutzlehre) gave rise to several interpretations, some of which procceded by psychological reasoning (using the Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics), interpretations which Weber combated in his 1908 article.

ID HISTORY; WORKS
AB Is there reason to believe that Weber's work was influenced by Nietzsehe's thought ? An examination of the debates around this question in Germany and the English-speaking world allows for nuancing and indeed rejecting any such hypothesis. In this Study the question of Weber's relations with the Niet/scheans and "Nietzscheisms" has been left aside, and priority given to the main ideas of the two thinkers. in a reasoned comparison of their respective thinking on the themes of religion, science, and politics. Significant between them are observed in those three areas but Weber approaches Nietzches's work in a contrasted and differentiated way. combining, common themes. use of critical refutation. and a degree of ironic suspicion.

TI Weber's Ecrits politiques: sociological insight into contemporary issues
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB This publication of a part of Weber's political writings is clearly an occasion for drawing French-language readers' attention to the specifically sociological thrust of the writings in question. Though they are closely tied to context and circumstances, the most important among them take up extremely broad issues, which Weber handles from distinctly sociological points of view, making more or less explicit use of some of his major conceptual instruments. His in-depth analyses of the Russian Revolution of 1905 and its outcome are a brilliant illustration of this type of approach. In the first he presents an overview of Russian society that allows him to identify the multiple obstacles to successful development of bourgeois democracy in Russia; in the second he stresses the increasingly marked political closure in Russia, as reflected in its " pseudo-constitutionalism ". Moreover, in writing his renowned " Parliament and government in a reconstructed Germany " , a vigorous critique of bureaucracy and an acute perception of the dangers inherent in the extension of bureaucratic power, he directly transposed analyses taken from his " sociology of domination ". In general, it is Weber's sociological understanding that led him to perceive a tendency toward bureaucratization in modern societies, and to seek counterweights to it. Large-scale socialism seemed to him particularly ill-equipped to fulfill this function. He first attempted to confer the counterweight role on a strong parliament then thought he has found at least a partial answer in plebiscitary power in the form of the Reichsprasident. In this way he identified yet another tendency of modern politics, that seemed to him to derive from mass democracy and confrontation among organized political parties.

ID MARKET
AB The problematic of how supply and demand meet on a particular market is at the core of the economic sociology project. For several years this problematic has generated detailed analyses of the ways in which judgments of product or service-provider quality are constructed before the exchange relation occurs. Through observation of how funeral services are purchased and analysis of competition dynamics on local funeral service markets, this article brings to light certain alternative ways of organizing the marketplace encounter in this business sector. It describes arrangements used to capture the market, such as socio-technical operations for channeling customers toward a single service provider. It shows the degree to which service-provider activity, relations among competitors, and the market regulation game in this sector are structured by moves to produce an economy based on client manipulation.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
ID CRIME; VICTIMIZATION
AB Using both quantitative and qualitative analysis (data from the Enquete nationale sur les violences envers les femmes - national survey on violence against women - and in-depth ad hoc interviews), this article explores relations between women's feelings of insecurity, the experience of victimization, and women's mobility in public places - points generally handled two by two rather than all together. While relatively few women spontaneously declare they are afraid to go out alone, study of their actual practices and the content of their discourse enables us to qualify this assessment. In fact, many women are not confronted with the prospect of going out alone at night, namely married women or women living with a male partner and women who, given the sexual division of labor, have little or no free time. Moreover, analysis of the practices of women who do go out alone at night suggests that doing so involves abiding by a major condition - maintaining strong mental vigilance a condition revealed in their many tactics for avoiding contact, tactics which they consider imperative. Mental vigilance is particularly strong among women who have been victims of aggression. Experiencing aggression in a public place does not seem to hinder women's mobility. However, violence of any kind, even the most apparently harmless or inconsequential, limits women's freedom of movement in that it carries with it a threat felt over and beyond the moment it occurs, and increases what many women declare to be their fear of the outside.

TI Teaching practices of vocational high school teachers : a combined
   struggle against scholastic failure and to keep students motivated.
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB Working in the context of the declining world of industrial labor and the disrepute into which the vocational - path, has fallen, vocational high school teachers have to deal with a student body that has failed in middle school and is manifestly uninterested in scholastic and occupational activities. Sociological analysis of the pedagogical practices of these teachers reveals that changes in hiring mode and the fact that subject content has gradually become more abstract and academic have not eliminated strategies for reconciling students with the schooling institution before taking on the act of teaching, transmitting knowledge or know-how, Such reconciliation seems to be a prerequisite for all teaching work. and though some students are considered - irretrievable. most of the vocational teachers interviewed accept the idea that their student,. have experienced failure and that as teachers they therefore cannot expect to have any - ideal customers.. Students are perceived to have a combination of cognitive, psychological. and social difficulties, and this leads teachers to adopt pedagogical strategies which, while subject to disciplinarity specificities, appear overall to emphasize individualized attention and the need to encourage students. make them feel valued (through evaluation., productive - work. and the transmission of goal-oriented knowledge). The purposes; associated with vocational teaching and teachers' ability to combine the work of socialization and knowledge transmission circumscribe the effectiveness of their practices. While what are deemed pedagogical necessities cannot readily respond to or accommodate changes in knowledge content and cognitive demands, they ultimately seem to echo the habitus of vocational high school teachers, who not only feel they constitute a dominated group within the schooling institution but have also, in some cases, experienced scholastic difficulties themselves and are often from working-class backgrounds like their students.

ID RESOURCE; NETWORKS; PEERS; COSTS
AB This article analyzes an attempt to reorganize a market in which strong environmental pressure had transformed supply rules. The small merchants of the center city were up against tremendous difficulties which forced them to redefine their strategies, The research focuses on two initiatives : a governmental program providing financial incentives for shop renovation and keeping shops open on Saturday afternoons. Merchant participation in these initiatives was low despite the economic incentive. Structural analysis was used to try to understand why merchants were unable to coordinate. The results show, that the minority of merchants who were disposed to engage in collective action were those most firmly rooted or embedded in the local community. This supports the economic sociology argument that social relations among economic actors affect the results of economic action. The majority of small merchants were both unembedded and had a negative perception of the risks involved in an associative strategy, Lastly, division and lack of leadership resources in this milieu worked to prevent massive merchant mobilization.

AB In the 1980s in France, the term precarite [an objective Situation of socio-economic insecurity, precariousness], which was being used in both political and policy discourse and social science research, became highly polysemic, At first it was a category of political discourse. In sociology, it is marked by its earliest use in sociology of the family its later. specific use in describing employment-related situations and its most recent use to characterize French society as a whole. Comparative research on the five most populous countries of the European Union shows that the term cannot be used directly in international comparisons precarite throughout Europe cannot be measured comparatively. Other. more specific categories must he constructed which, though imperfect, allow for grasping the dimensions of what in France is customarily designated by this semantically proliferating term.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
AB This article offers a critical analysis of the performance indicators for French lycees [high schools] published annually on the internet by the Departement des Etudes et de la Prospective. In a study of the 103 lycees in the Bordeaux educational area, school performance was considered in relation to pupils' starting academic level (n = 18 000) as measured by grades on the middle school written leaving exam. The analysis identified four main points. 1) Schools assumed comparable in terms of type of pupil pool in fact educate pupils of highly diverse academic levels, which distorts << value added >> calculations. 2) This phenomenon constitutes a systematic bias that leads to under-evaluating lycees attended by lower-status class pupils and over-evaluating lycees more privileged in terms of pupil pool. 3) The systematic evaluation bias in turn results from localized schooling markets which affect who enrols in what lycees and thereby accentuate inequalities among schools. 4) The author proposes an experimental method of calculating a << corrective adjustment >> of expectations about individual schools by taking into account initial academic level of first-year lycee pupils.

AB This article examines de facto ethnic segregation in middle school [college] in France on the basis of an analysis of the distribution of more than 144,000 pupils among the 333 middle schools of the Bordeaux educational area. An indicator is constructed that defines the ethnicity variable using the criterion of pupil first name and allows for distinguishing between "native" and "non-native" pupils. Pupil distribution among the area's middle schools by this variable is then observed, bringing to light considerable dispersion, and evidence that a small proportion of area schools educate a high proportion of non-native pupils. Lastly, the article examines the effects of the observed ethnic segregation on scholastic performance and post-middle school path.

TI The "military society" - Its future seen through professionalization
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
AB After clarifying what should be meant by "military society", one is reminded that human and social sciences have for a long time shown interest in warfare and armies by giving priority to three viewpoints: historical, functionalist and socio-legal. But these are debatable even outmoded points that should be set aside to make room for another model which is termed here as a cultural one. Then, the conditions in which this entity appeared are recalled and they refer to a precise socio-cultural context: the one deriving from the birth of the nation-state in nineteenth century Europe. However, in order to be able to speak about a society, it is therefore necessary to fulfil several conditions, these are detailed in a second part where the specific features of a military group are given in more details. Once this done, the point at issue is to know whether the main characteristics which used to make of the armies a society are still valid. An attentive examination of changes that inter-state and indeed within a state confrontations have experienced in the post-Cold War era and these coinciding with army professionalization that many western countries have started, compel us to doubt somewhat the preservation of the present military society. In other words, we can bet on a relative withdrawing of the socio-cultural specificity of the military world within the global society.

AB This article offers a critical analysis of four contemporary sociological debates. Systematic analysis of the relevant literature suggests the existence of a plan for refomulating the methodological foundations of empirical quantitative sociology. In the reconstruction here undertaken, the following idea may be seen to emerge : an alliance of variable analysis, mechanism methodology, and simulation technique would be of great help in resolving some of the impasses that << Standard >> empirical quantitative sociology encounter. This thesis is then tested for quantitative sociology of social mobility, and irrefutable signs that the idea is being accepted for this area of study are presented. Lastly, a link is established between these recent debates and older, similar proposals for resolving the problem, and the question is raised why the soundness of these proposals has only recently been recognized.

TI "Disaffection" for science studies: Paradoxes of the French case
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
ID DEMOCRATIZATION; EDUCATION
AB Young people's disaffection for science studies is a phenomenon common to many industrialized countries. It is too readily attributed to young people's presumed image of science. In the French case it would be more accurate to attribute this phenomenon to socio-demographic causes. The fact that there is no simple connection between choice of higher education study path and disciplinary content is shown by a striking paradox: higher education enrolment in Physics-Chemistry began failing sharply in France at precisely the moment a Physics-Chemistry concentration was introduced at the lycee [high school] level. The explanation proposed here pertains to the French disciplinary hierarchy. For many lycee students, the choice of physics-chemistry rather than mathematics is associated with lower scholastic ambition, this in turn associated with lower scholastic performance and/or more modest social background. This observation is generalizable. One of the causes of disaffection for science studies in France is the increasingly less distinguishing character of lycee science studies. Over the last fifteen years and particularly since 1995, steadily increasing numbers of female lycee students, "average" students, and students of modest social background have chosen to obtain a science-concentration baccalaureat [lycee leaving examination and degree]. With all else kept equal, students in each of these categories, for reasons specific to it, are also less likely to opt for long higher education science studies.

AB The article describes prostitution as practiced in brothels and discotheques in Rio de Janeiro as a commercial and relational activity made up of a set of tasks that impose a variety of constraints. Assuming the position of a certain type of client, the author has observed and analyzed the operations that precede the sexual act : preparation, approaching and establishing contact with the customer, negotiating, and so forth. The article shows how the form of these relations and the way they occur changes by type of place, as place determines customer type and type of organization and payment. The practical dimensions of the activity enable such prostitution to << exist >> and condition how actors react in these particular social situations.

DT Article
AB This text analyzes certain contributions and limits of rational choice theory with regard to the problem of links between the micro and macro levels. Coleman's criticisms of Weber's theory in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism are examined and certain of his misreadings of Weber brought to light, together with their meta-theoretical bases. An attempt is made to show not only that Weber's theory identifies the mechanisms for moving from micro to macro but also that it accounts more effectively than expected utility theory for macrophenomena such as capitalism, while helping us understand not the emergence of a single norm, which rational choice theory can explain, but a constellation of integrated norms. It also shows how the theory of instrumental rationality merely contributes to a particular perspective in sociological tradition's understanding of norm emergence, namely the Hobbesian one, and recalls a number of problems that rational choice theory has not convincingly resolved.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

AB James Coleman's project was to resocialize rational choice while keeping micro-macro connections as operational as they are in economics. His general model in Foundations of sociological theory either accounts for norms while effacing social organization, or brings social organization to the fore (in the reduced form of social capital distribution) while failing to generate sufficient norms. A parallel simulation study suggests that the problem lies in the type of rationality itself: Coleman's rationality is merely calculative; only interpretive rationality can take collective entities into consideration. This change would require the rational actor to accede to a less cursory type of language, intensional rather than extensional.

TI The reproduction of corporate groups as stable socio-economic entities

AB The article presents the results of a quantitative analysis of French corporate groups spanning the years 199 1 to 1999. In the first section, an attempt is made to show that corporate groups constitute new social entities characterized by dense, multiple exchanges among the companies they comprise. The different types of resources circulating within groups are described. The second section shows that despite crystallization of this kind of social entity, corporate groups remain highly malleable, which is what allows them to endure over the long term. By renewing members of the collectives they manage, corporate groups are able to keep a continuous watch on market trends. The article thus concurs with important studies in economic sociology showing that these groups are able to manage the fundamental problem of << the paradox of embeddedness >> : they are neither excessively nor insufficiently embedded, but rather immobilized in a cohesive, stable collective configuration; they have attained the << happy medium >>, and this in turn explains to a large degree their domination of the contemporary French economy.

TI Social stratification of musical tastes: Questioning the cultural
   legitimacy model
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
ID EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT; MASS-CULTURE
AB In sociological study of artistic tastes, the behavior of the upper classes is usually characterized by a penchant for "highbrow" arts and simultaneous rejection of popular arts and the products of mass culture. However, the trends brought to light by analysis of cultural practices survey data do not entirely confirm this representation. What distinguishes upper class behavior is in fact not so much familiarity with "legitimate" culture, as is often claimed, but diversity of stated preferences, in contrast to members of lower-status classes, whose preferences appear more exclusive. A contrast can therefore be established between the traditional model of cultural legitimacy and a model in terms of eclecticism. This article seeks to assess the import of the latter model on the basis of data on preferences in music from a 1997 survey of French cultural practices. First, French practices in this area unequivocally confirm the relevance of the eclecticism model, though that model appears more an extension of the cultural legitimacy model than a refutation of it. Second, the preference typology constructed through analysis of the data, and distribution of individuals by social factors among five music-listener profiles defined on the basis of that typology, forefront the importance of generation differences and uneven distribution of cultural capital and musical competence.

TI Strategic analysis and culture : a necessary return to sources.
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB In Michel Crozier's Le phenomene bureaucratique (The bureaucratic phenomenon), cultural context is said to play an essential role in organization functioning, but this idea has been largely discounted in strategic analysis, both in the theoretical texts and to an even greater degree in empirical strategy analyses. The main reason given for this position is that actors' capacity to construct the rules that frame their actions, and the considerable variety of operation modes discernible within a single cultural context, are incompatible with cultural determinism. The article shows this argument to be based on a particular conception of culture as governing attitudes, behavior, and values, a conception that dominated in the social sciences a few decades ago but is increasingly less likely to be accredited today. A more exact way of apprehending culture, i.e., culture as semantic context, makes it possible to reconcile strategic and cultural types of analysis.

TI Radical academicism or sociological monologue: who are sociologists
   talking with
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB Since the 1990s, a sociological approach known as << radical academicism >> has developed, with considerable success, in France. Based on identifying the sociologist as a kind of << objectivity >> source external to society (society being incarnated by the institution), radical academicism leads to a sort of elitism : only an elite of << savants >>, this thinking goes, can accede to the clear thinking offered by theory and universal values. The sociologist is understood not to be subject to social determinism of the sort he can see at work in others' lives. He is therefore led to engage in a monologue and establish his << self >> as the point where science and politics connect. This in turn means he is in a position to << show >> the dominated the real meaning of their actions. In addition to the benefits this position provides, it joins up with the social experience of << intellos precaires >> [intellectuals in a precarious socio-economic situation], thus enabling that group to put their << misere >> on a par with the << suffering >> of the most deprived persons or groups in society and thereby to universalize their own interests. Radical academicism is sharply hostile to democracy, and there is a strong correspondance between this approach and the mixture of self-pity and critical distance that characterizes middle-class ideology. In political terms, radical academicism clearly expresses the grip that the middle classes have on the world of labor demands and other social demands and their ability to weaken the defenses of the classes populaires.

AB The price formation process calls economic theories to account as soon as the notion of << quality >> is introduced. This article uses the principle of << embeddedness >> postulated by economic sociology to show how analysis of price formation can point to and reveal the social organization of markets for quality goods. A comprehensive approach to how Burgundy wine producers set their prices makes it possible to explain how their various decision-making procedures are related to statuses and professional relations. Using << integration variables >> that are both economic and sociological, the discussion opens prospects for renewed dialogue between the two disciplines and thus represents a move forward in understanding the << economics of quality >>.

TI Between individualization and participation: engagement in
   association-linked volunteer work
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB Comparing two types of volunteer-work commitment or engagement, the neighborhood activist type and the charity type, leads to positing that the cornerstone of the meaning of contemporary association-linked volunteer-work engagement is the identity-founding that is realized through associative affiliation. In a social context where institutions are being recomposed and a high value is placed on individual autonomy, doing volunteer work represents a potential stimulant for identity construction in that it offers the individual a renewed collective framework. The ability of volunteer-work engagement to reconcile individualization and social participation is what explains the central position such engagement is likely to occupy with respect to social-identity mechanisms. Underlying the two forces that drive this kind of engagement, namely, ethics and pleasure, are 1) the contemporary imperative of realizing a unique. autonomous self - this in turn explains rejection of high religious or political morality, the individualized relation to ethics repertoires and to association arguments themselves, and the emergence of a hedonistic dimension closely linked to the individual's relation to self - and 2) a will to participate socially, which is revealed by the values mobilized in volunteer-work engagement but also by the dialogical nature of the pleasure emergence sources, a will that becomes necessity within a framework of identity negotiation that requires otherness. Because association Volunteer work allows the fundamental << individualization-participation >> and is replayed, it is one socializing activity among others and should be analyzed as such.

ID ARRANGEMENTS
AB The network-firm has come to dominate over the last two decades as a new reference model in the industrial world. From the complex of reasons for this change. the following hypothesis may be identified : what moves businesses to outsource some of their activities and to << network >> is a concern to better control productive activity. This hypothesis is tested in the field by identifying the reasons actors cite to explain such externalizing. From these observations a redefinition of the core business of network-firms is inferred - all justifications of externalization are based on this notion - and it is shown that the core competence is now more closely identified with a political skill dedicated to << network governance >> than with technological skills strictly speaking. Lastly, this reasoning makes it possible to reconsider the question of the firm-as-institution by locating the boundaries of the firm at the perimeter, where the activity of << governing >> the business is exercised.

AB Based on L'Allemagne au-dessus de tout, the paper aims at demonstrating that international relations are a sociological object as another one, especially after 1895 (Durkheim applies concepts of normal and pathological, he sees an order thanks to moral and legal tasks enforced by international << milieu >>). Nevertheless. Durkheim does not conceive humanity as a morphological and State, for him, stands for a structure not overreached. Our analysis underlines a sociological thought which is modern and present. It criticizes also two ideas : Durkheim Would not dealt international relations, Durkheim would devises international society like national one.

ID LEVYBRUHL
AB La morale et la science des moeurs, published in 1903, may appear to mark a sociological shift in the thinking of Lucien Levy-Bruhl, and it partially prefigures his later works. This is nonetheless a philosophical or epistemological work addressed to philosophers and aimed at convincing them to give up constructing theoretical moral systems that cannot claim to be scientific and will necessarily be superceded by a sociological a moral science. Well received by Durkheimian sociologists - though Durkheim himself was then giving up the kind of categorical opposition here systematized by Ldvy-Bruhl - the work provoked numerous critical protests from philosophers. In 1906 Levy-Bruhl himself synthesized these critiques and uncompromisingly refuted them. Thirty years later, Georges Gurvitch wrote a work affirming that, on the contrary, philosophical and sociological approaches to moral phenomena were complementary and both were necessary.

AB This article presents the main results of a study that evaluates and analyzes the influence of social composition of schooling context - termed school mix in English-language literature on pupils' progress and some of their attitudes, as well as on certain teacher judgments, at the primary school and seconde [second form (GB)/tenth grade (US)] lycee (high school) levels. The influence of school mix on pupil progress in a given year seems slight. Moreover, the results show significant contextual effects on pupils' occupational aspirations, some of their attitudes, and teacher expections and demands. It remains to be seen, however, how best to apprehend the way effects of context accumulate over time, as well as what components of context - normative climate in class, teaching and pedagogical functioning, social mix itself - are likely to produce differences.

DT Article
ID SCHOOL
AB To identify and distinguish contemporary experiences of domination, it is necessary to use two analytical approaches. The first requires taking into account forms of domination that are perceived more and more openly as insurmountable constraints; the second considers paradoxical expressions of domination, where domination is maintained through strange types of critical consent. The latter variety suggests the need to distinguish between two major mechanisms of subjective inscription : traditional forms of subjection, to which are added new responsibilization processes. Once these two analytic lines have been presented, it becomes possible to distinguish four main ideal-typical experiences of domination : inculcation, implosion, injunction, devolution.

TI Preventing violence in activist activity: three case studies.
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
ID MOBILIZATION
AB This article focuses on how activist groups work to manage tense situations, preventing them from tipping over into violence. The situations these groups are involved in (demonstrations, for example) are characterized by combined worry and uncertainty about outcome. The prospect of violence appears when actors demonstrate either excessive or insufficient engagement. These two types of risk are examined successively in terms of how activists work to reduce or correct them. They do so not just by creating proximity ties with others in face-to-face relations (tact, solicitude, listening, trust, a compensatory type of deference, care not to hurt the person) but also by taking into account the material surroundings of the action (ensuring this cannot facilitate a shift to violence). It is shown that the public engagement of such groups is strengthened by more particular types of engagement. Activist activity is seen to be an activity of composition in which actors work to organize group heterogeneity.

It first presents an ideal-typical definition of prototypes, which is then used to demonstrate the prototypical character of such concerts. It then shows how this product and the main ways it is marketed (the economics of the concert tour) are based on competition mechanisms and types of exchange logic that vary by whether partners to the transactions are regular or occasional.

AB The much less thanclassic modelmuch greater than developed in the last fifteen years for analyzing social movements has considerably influenced both European and American sociological research. Three recent works undertake to critically revise this dominant perspective, which is often overly static and objectivist, and to lay the foundations for a more dynamic, relational approach to contentious collective action. In Silence and voice in the study of contentious politics, R. Aminzade et al. set out to fill the main much less thansilencesmuch greater than left by sociology of mobilization. In Dynamics of contention, D. McAdam, S. Tarrow, and.Ch. Tilly lay the foundation for a unified approach to the various types of contentious politics. J. Goldstone, in States, parties and social movements, attempts to develop the potential of such an approach for the study of relations between much less thaninstitutionalmuch greater than and much less thannon-institutionalmuch greater than politics.

ID VICTIMIZATION RATES; CRIME; FEAR; RISK
AB The article seeks to demonstrate that the sudden rise in preoccupations with security and law and order at the time of the 2002 elections in France cannot be explained solely by circumstantial factors but reflects instead a profound transformation in these concerns. After the relevance and limitations of an analysis in purely circumstantial terms is shown, the main demonstration is constructed around the distinction that has been developed between fear and preoccupation. Data from a survey conducted with near-annual regularity from 1977 to 2002 are then used to demonstrate how security preoccupations have become repatterned since the mid-nineties in such a way that an autonomous version of this type of concern is now to be found in social groups previously reluctant to adopt an attitude of concern about security. The last part of the article discusses the import of the results obtained : How should they be interpreted, and how can they be expected to affect security policy ?.

   France
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
ID ACADEMIC CAREER; MARKET; SCIENTISTS; MOBILITY; NETWORKS; SYSTEM
AB Research on social networks has brought to light two patterns of relations among individuals that may function as capital : open, diverse, porous relations, and dense, closed, stable ones. Far from being contradictory, these two forms correspond to two different types of competition : the individual quest for personal advantage within the group, and the need to mobilize the group to compete with other groups. Our case study of PhD juries in the field of political science in France demonstrates that these two effects may coexist; we show how the networks that determine who gets invited to sit on thesis juries impact on candidates' employment prospects. We argue that in the short term and on a personal scale, having a heterogeneous jury, i.e., whose members have only slight connections to the thesis director, adds to the value of the doctoral degree within the discipline and helps successful candidates find jobs. In the long term and at the collective level, forming a jury that reflects a dense, cohesive, institution-based network, whether the institutions are universities or subdisciplines, favors defense, reproduction, and further extension of the group in its competition with other groups.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB The article presents the results of an individual interview survey of self-declared Beatles fans. The comprehensive interview method circumvents the problem of stigmatization associated with intense passions. The life stories collected point up identity strategies in which significant value is attributed to the quest for a differentiated self-image; in this they conform to results obtained in studies of contemporary individualization processes. The point of optimum differentiation nonetheless represents a fragile balance, one continually called into question by the development pattern of such passions.

TI Changing trends in religious feeling in Europe and Russia
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French
DT Article
AB In the 1981 and 1990 European Values Surveys, nearly all religious variables showed a decline, particularly sharp among young people, with the exception of belief in an afterlife. The younger a person was, the less religious he or she was likely to be. This confirmed the thesis that Western Europe was becoming increasingly secular. However, the latest wave of surveys, from 1999, shows this decline to be counterbalanced by two other trends : stronger religious feeling within the Christian faith and belief unaccompanied by religious membership. These phenomena are much more pronounced among young people. The strength of the three respective trends varies by country. Stronger versions of the same trends may be observed in the former Eastern bloc countries and Russia, once again particularly among young people. These changes are seen to represent a move away from the break with religion that characterized the 1960s and '70s.

TI Constraint and freedom in architectural design work
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
AB This article attempts to clarify the concepts of freedom and constraint through a study of architectural design work, an activity that its practitioners represent as a constraining space, though they in fact manage to find new solutions within it. The study aims at both factual and theoretical results : factual in that the difficulties of exercising this profession seem to be due less to constraints than the excessive degree of responsibility and near impracticability of the studies they induce; theoretical because certain facts suggest that a fundamental revision of the negative relation generally understood to obtain between freedom and constraint is in order. Two examples of such facts : prohibitions are not as constraining as prescriptions, and certain much less than absorption much greater than strategies can open a path to freedom while following a given constraint much less than to the lettermuch greater than.

AB This study, based on observation and interviews with employees and managers of the French postal service << La Poste >>, was conducted to improve knowledge of the alcohol consumption and alcoholism specific to this occupational milieu. Neither of these practices can be studied in isolation from employee socializing and workplace mutual assistance practices, or from the social control practices that regulate routine production activity and, specifically, require managers to report << intemperate agents>>. Analysis of interdependence between routine work and alcohol consumption practices sheds light on why managers often manifest a passive attitude despite regulations requiring them to report so-called alcoholic employees.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

AB The status of the notion of objectivity, a central question in current sociology of knowledge debates, is also a fundamental presupposition in several interpretations of Durkheim's epistemology. This analysis focuses on Les formes elementaires de la vie religieuse, where Durkheim is obliged to defend the objectivity of representation against the relativist or constructivist implications of his own sociology of knowledge and religion. Despite the aporia in it, the type of ontology required by this text continually presents sound arguments to support the postulate that a social reality exists that is independent of our representations. Though this is not sufficient to resolve all difficulties, it should dissuade us from claiming he "fathered" different or opposed theses simply because he was not fully able to demonstrate a particular one.

AB A panoramic view of religion in Europe is sketched on the basis of an international survey of religious attitudes (International Social Survey Programme, 1998). It is then shown that integration into a religious system (on a scale from "regular church-goer" to "no religion") has significant effects on ethical and political attitudes (regarding sexual permissiveness, men's and women's roles in society, abortion, civic morality, confidence in institutions, political orientation). Whatever the European country, integration into Catholicism or Protestantism corresponds to attitudes that are more traditional, conformist, and politically to the right. No clear difference may be observed between Catholics and Protestants, groups that today are culturally fairly close.

ID COPING STRATEGIES; LIFE-CYCLE; COUPLES
AB In the 1970s and 1980s, a number of studies brought to light a variety of family interaction styles characterizing contemporary French society. Which of them have lasted ? Flow are they related to the social structure ? What problems and conflicts do they tend to bring about ? This article aims to answer these questions on the basis of a large representative sample indicating couples social and generational characteristics. Five styles were empirically identified. associated with strongly unequal frequency levels for problems and open conflicts. Prevalent marital conflict coincides with a strong tendency for spouse or partner autonomy, gender-differentiated roles, and couple self-enclosure. These results are largely due to the differential effect of the conflict-management modes inherent in the various interaction styles, these being influenced by couples social characteristics and position. No increasing standardization of marital modes was observed : indeed, advanced modernity seems characterized instead by several fairly distinct models highly dependent on position within the social structure.

AB In the last twenty years, the question has been raised of what audience there is for parascience in our societies: in what measure does the public say it believes in the reality of a number of phenomena such as explanation of personality by astrological signs, thought transference and bewitchment? This article is based on comparative analysis of the results of five opinion surveys conducted between 1982 and 2000 on belief in 11 parascientific phenomena. The data indicate that, contrary to a commonly held view, such belief does not seem to have grown perceptibly over the period. With regard to socio-demographic and ideological determinants, there are certain regularities: woman, young people, and people who believe in an afterlife are more inclined to say they believe in parascience.

AB Socioeconomic analysis of youth employment in Japan sheds light on the factors that might explain the level of labour force participation among young people and the conditions under which such participation takes place. In particular, it highlights the linkage between employers' labour force flexibilisation strategies and the family dependence mechanisms in which young people have their part to play. In our view, the increasing difficulties being experienced by young Japanese people in the labour market can be explained by the way in which youth employment is socially constructed rather than by any hypothetical change in the work ethic.

ID COMPETENCE; EXCHANGE
AB What is behind the semantic shift from manual worker to operator ? For some analysts, it is part and parcel of a new model, << competence>>, which promises to << return work to the worker ) (Philippe Zarifian) through increased attention to worker participation. The idea put forward and defended in this article is that far from bringing to a halt the process of separating work from the worker. the << competence >> model actually pushes that process forward. Indeed, the new model is bringing about enterprise occupation normalization. The model is based on a fully developed << arrangement >> in Foucault's sense of the term for transforming the manual worker into an operator. To demonstrate this, the article presents the ideal in which a particular figure of the operator is inscribed and anticipated, and analyzes how a new type of work discipline becomes instituted in industrial shops. The adaptation and resistance modes thereby activated in the worker raise the question of what this new situation means, a question which, thus put, encompasses considerations of the types of properties workers are recognized as having and the various means and media they dispose of for freely choosing their activity.

ID POLITICS; STATE
AB Since the 1970s, the French welfare system has been reformed in three distinct ways: reducing social security deficits by increasing employer and employee social contributions; controlling spending through retrenchment of social programs; transforming the system's foundations through institutional change. First attempts at reforming the social insurance system were blocked in part by that system's own institutions. But under European Union constraints, French governments have managed to negotiate measures that reduce social benefits by sharpening the separation between the worlds of social insurance and national solidarity. Institutional reform was only marginal at first, and based on ambiguous and in some cases contradictory consensus. However, such reform is now working to further what has become a general process of "dualizing" the French welfare system.

   CANNABIS; RACE; TWIN; INEQUALITIES; CAUSATION
AB As may be seen from a study of the scholarly literature, the contemporary success of the notion of << risk-taking behavior >> is largely due to use of the epidemiology paradigm for studying human behavior. The paradigm gives primacy to prediction over understanding, and in general to an individual-focused multifactor causality model. This in turn produces a proliferation of behaviors labelled << risky >>, raises methodological and discrimination problems, and makes it extremely difficult to bring scientific controversies to a close. From a sociological perspective, the disadvantage of the epidemiological approach to studying risk-taking behaviors is that it evacuates the social dimension of human behavior, especially since, in trying to resolve ongoing controversies, epidemiology-paradigm studies tend to favor approaches that subject risk-taking behavior to pharmacological or genetic determinism.

AB Bronislaw Malinowski began producing scientific texts several years before conducting his ethnographic study of the Trobriand Islands during World War I. This article shows how his first book, The Family among the Australian Aborigenes. A Sociological Study (1913), can very much be considered the matrix of his later research; in this work he lays the foundations for his later methodological innovations and outlines a first analysis of kinship phenomena. Moreover, from the start Malinowski granted a crucial role to what he claimed to be certain primitive peoples' ignorance of physiological paternity. He could not accept contradiction on this point, as is made particularly clear in his dispute with the colonial administrator Alex Rentoul. Malinowski's harsh, unpleasant tone in their exchange of views suggests the strong transferential aspect of this theme.

ID COGNITIVE OUTCOMES; SECONDARY-SCHOOLS; EDUCATION; ACHIEVEMENT
AB On the basis of a 1989 French Education Ministry panel, this study pursues the comparison between private versus public sectors with regard to scholastic success undertaken by G. Langouet and A. Leger in their 1994 study, Ecole publique ou ecole privee ? Trajectoires et reussites scolaires. After an overview of American research which underlines the potentially strong effect of selection biases and the necessity of taking these into account, the two sectors are compared with regard to two main concerns : sector efficiency or ability to produce an overall result, sector equity or ability to reduce socially-based inequalities in scholastic success within that sector. The apparent advantage of being continuously schooled in the private sector brought to light by Langouet and Leger is not always maintained when pupils are made comparable. The overall effect varies by private sector weight in local school supply. In areas where the private sector has a strong presence, differences in pupil itineraries and social recruitment from one sector to the other are slight. However, consistent with Langouet and Leger's results, the private sector does seem to display smaller differences in school success by social milieu.
