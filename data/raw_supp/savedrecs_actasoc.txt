TI The welfare state criticism of the losers of modernization: How social
   experiences of resentment shape populist welfare critique
SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA

DE Welfare state criticism; welfare populism; modernization loser theory;

AB This article aims to explain the paradoxical finding that socio-economically vulnerable groups express more economic, moral and social criticism of the welfare state. As these groups generally benefit more from the welfare state and hold more egalitarian world views, their stronger criticism cannot be explained by the traditional frameworks of self-interest and ideology. As an alternative, we highlight the importance of social experiences of resentment as a source of discontent with welfare state performance. Our contribution argues that the dissatisfaction is embedded in a broader welfare populist critique that pits the hard-working people against the deceitful elite and welfare abusers. This welfare populism emerges from experiences of resentment related to the restructuring of group positions in the process of modernization. We differentiate between three types of discontent: economic status insecurity, group relative deprivation and social distrust. By applying structural equation modelling, we test whether resentful experiences mediate the relationship between the social structural position and welfare state criticism. Results indicate that relative deprivation consistently leads to more economic, moral and social criticism. Social distrust, moreover, stimulates a higher level of moral criticism. This study illustrates that resentment is indeed an important element for understanding the paradoxical relationship between social class and welfare state criticism.

DE Career sequences; career stability; cross-cohort changes; linked
   employer-employee data; regression decomposition; Finland
AB In this article, we investigate whether the mid-career stability of Finnish men and women has changed for the birth cohorts 1958 to 1972 and, if so, what the driving forces are behind such changes. We analyse career stability during a 15-year period following the age of 30 using 'career turbulence' indicators. To identify the impact of cyclical and structural changes in the labour market, we analyse the association between initial employment status and sector with subsequent career stability. We distinguish between sectors that are exposed to a greater or lesser extent to global competition, those that are characterised by goods production or service provision, and those that are part of the market or non-market sector. In a series of OLS regression and regression decomposition analyses, we also control for the impact of education, regional unemployment and family-formation processes. The results show little change in mid-career stability across cohorts. Stability increased somewhat when only including transitions between employment and non-employment, whereas slight destabilisation was observed when accounting for changes between jobs. The findings indicate that the small changes in stability across cohorts were mostly driven by structural changes in the labour market, albeit with different mechanisms for men and women.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Ayahuasca; LSD; mysticism; narratives; psilocybin; psychedelics
AB We are now witnessing a radical revival in clinical research on the use of psychedelics (e.g. LSD and psilocybin), where 'mystical' experiences are at the centre. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 50 psychedelic drug users, we document how they draw on archetypical mystical narratives, comprising three key dimensions: (1) the transcendence of time and space; (2) deep euphoria; and (3) the perception of being at one with 'a larger whole'. We suggest that the evolving new cultures around the use of psychedelics contain a variety of narratives, with clear roots in traditional mystical thinking. At the same time, these narratives reflect current cultural and political influences, including the narratives of oneness with plants and animals and our perceived need to protect nature. We conclude that the way people experience mystical occasions due to psychedelic use have archetypical patterns, but culturally specific storylines.

ID WELFARE-STATE; INCOME INEQUALITY; EMPLOYMENT; PARADOX; WORK
AB The paper analyses changes in the generosity of public transfers to the unemployed and their effectiveness for the alleviation of poverty risks in Germany and Great Britain between the 1990s and the 2000s. In the light of changing poverty risks among the unemployed, the contribution of policy changes is assessed using individual-level data on household incomes. The results indicate that the introduction and expansion of the tax credit programmes in Britain led to an increase of public transfers especially for those with low household market incomes and thereby also improved the effectiveness of transfers in combating poverty. In Germany, the generosity of transfers to the unemployed hardly changed over time, whereas the effectiveness of transfers to prevent households from falling into poverty declined. This can be explained by changes in the composition of the unemployed by recent labour force participation and household market incomes. As former labour market insiders are consistently better protected from poverty than former outsiders, the results confirm the stratified nature of unemployment protection in Germany, albeit no significant trend towards increasing dualisation in public benefits is found. Thus, the results do not support notions of a fundamental shift of the system of unemployment protection with respect to the generosity of transfers in Germany but emphasise the importance of changes in the German labour market.

AB The development of medical technologies is often assumed to improve medical treatment, but may also reproduce health inequalities if their benefits are unequally distributed. Sociological studies have shown that social and moral evaluations matter for medical decision making, and that inequalities in access and outcome exist even in universal health care systems. This article uses the distribution of medical technologies in the treatment of type 1 diabetes as a case for examining the social production of health care inequalities. Drawing on observational data and in-depth interviews with physicians and nurses working in a Norwegian hospital, I demonstrate that medical staff evaluate patients based on a combination of medical, social and moral criteria. The concept of selective empowering is then elaborated and refined as a term for the practice in which medical professionals steer resources towards patients based on evaluations of need, competence and compliance. While previous studies of inequalities in medical care have often focused on medical staff's cognitive dispositions, I argue that selective empowering may be interpreted as a reflexive response to increasing health care costs and a structural dependency on expensive and commercially produced medical technologies.

AB This article compares how having a child with special needs shapes the labour market adaptations of immigrant and majority mothers. We use longitudinal data from Norwegian public registers including all women who gave birth between 2001 and 2005 (N = 104,988), and follow the mothers from two years before birth to four years after birth. We find generally large differences in employment and income among immigrant and majority mothers. Majority mothers typically adapt to the intensified care responsibilities associated with having a child with special needs by working somewhat less, but most importantly by combining work with high levels of long-term sickness absence. By contrast, immigrant mothers substantially reduce their work intensity (as measured through labour earnings) after childbirth regardless of whether their child has special needs. Among immigrant mothers whose child has special needs, we do not find elevated sickness absence levels comparable to that of majority mothers. Given the already reduced work intensity among immigrant mothers in the years following the birth of their child, we do not find additional labour market consequences of intensified care responsibilities within this group of mothers.

ID SWEDEN
AB Using classic elite understandings as our point of departure, we specify the constituent elements and repertoires of the cultural elite as these are described in Swedish and Norwegian newspapers. Through qualitative and quantitative content analyses, we contextualize and compare the cultural elite through five occupational categories and five main themes, and we ask how these characterizations affect the role this elite plays in politics. Also, we suggest a theoretical apparatus for how to link thematic analysis to national cultural repertoires and configurations. We find that there is a higher percentage of references to artists and those with authority over culture production in Sweden than in Norway, while the cultural elite are referred to as academics and culture policy influencers more often in Norway. Another finding is a high level of similarity between the two countries' view of the cultural elite as snobbish, politically correct, powerful, arrogant and privileged. The study shows that the cultural elite are drawn into a media logic in which they are portrayed as despised adversaries of ordinary people. However, the cultural elite is a more politically contentious label in Sweden than in Norway. The Swedish cultural elite are described as both more cherished and more despised. Moreover, access to membership in the cultural elite is more difficult, and the polarization between the cultural elite and ordinary people is stronger in Sweden.

AB Women generally have less job authority than men. Previous research has shown that human capital, family features and contextual factors cannot fully explain this gender authority gap. Another popular explanation holds that women's career opportunities are limited because their social networks comprise less beneficial contacts and resources than men's. Yet, the role of social networks has received little attention in empirical research seeking to explain the gender gap in job authority. This study examines to what extent gender differences in social networks exist and are related to the gender authority gap. Drawing on two strands of social network theory, we develop hypotheses about the role of network diversity and network status. We test these hypotheses using representative longitudinal data from the NEtherlands Longitudinal Lifecourse Study (2009-2013). Results reveal that women generally had less diverse occupational networks in terms of contacts' occupations and were less likely to know managers than men, network features which are found to be significantly related to job authority. Controlling for these gender differences in networks leads to a reduction of the observed gender authority gap that is statistically significant but modest in substantive terms.

AB As the scientific community urgently seeks to understand the uneven geographical patterns of transmission and mortality rates of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become necessary to challenge the tacit assumption that the pandemic is strictly a public health issue that is primarily reserved for the technocratic expertise of health professionals and officials. These discrepancies in outcome imply that the pandemic yields spatial selectivities (Jessop et al., 2008), which have been revealed through the uneven manifestation of societal impacts between places, localities, communities, and neighbourhoods. For this reason, the pandemic and the management thereof must be deemed as social issues that require the input of sociological theory, insofar as its spread is not only spatially embedded but also socially mediated. To foreground a socio-spatial perspective of the pandemic, I propose that we must start with two analytical premises on socio-spatiality.

DT Editorial Material
DE Pandemic; COVID-19; antivirals; vaccines; pharmaceuticalisation
AB The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has spread globally in a short period of time and quickly developed into a pandemic. In connection with its progress, entire cities and countries have been closed down, people are quarantined, and infrastructure and trade have been suspended. As this is a new virus, no vaccine or antiviral drugs are available, but instead non-medical measures such as social distancing may be used to reduce the spread. The Nordic countries, which are known for their similar welfare systems, have chosen pandemic strategies without coordinating with their neighbours. Over one night, Denmark closed the bridge to Sweden and shut down its society, while Sweden keeps as much open as possible and recommends its residents to comply with general advice on reducing the spread. Notably, this is the second time in a short time where Denmark and Sweden diverge in their pandemic response. In 2009, during the H1N1 (swine flu) outbreak, Denmark only vaccinated risk-groups whereas Sweden pursued a mass vaccination strategy. In a previous research project, we compared Sweden's and Denmark's contrasting pandemic response focusing on pharmaceutical interventions in terms of vaccination and antivirals. The pressing need to find a solution to the COVID-19 pandemic means that risks and shortcuts may have to be taken in order to come up with a vaccine with apparent risks to individual health. We can therefore see the current pandemic as an opportunity to expand sociological research, since Nordic cooperation once again is uncoordinated, despite signals and agreements of otherwise, and different drugs are fast tracked and already tested in human trials.

DT Article
DE Hysteresis; habitus; field; Pierre Bourdieu; sociology of work;
   COVID-19; pandemic; Labour market; crisis
AB Hysteresis is a versatile concept for volatile times. Pierre Bourdieu's sociological use recognises hysteresis in times of dislocation and disruption between field and habitus, 'in particular, when a field undergoes a major crisis and its regularities (even its rules) are profoundly changed' (Bourdieu, 2000: 160). In considering the issues and implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, hysteresis renders visible 'multi-level, multi-temporal dynamics' (Strand and Lizardo, 2016: 169). It is attendant to the temporality of work and how workers, workplaces, workforces and fields of work are affected. The COVID-19 crisis may give rise to sudden changes such as no work (e.g. redundancies, mass unemployment), reduced work (e.g. reduced hours, underemployment), suspended work (e.g. going on furlough), or absence from work (e.g. leave and workforce absence rates). The transition to working from home and online, en masse, raises considerations of habitus and taking practice online, with many experiencing rapid digital transformation and remote working. The COVID-19 pandemic raises significant sociological issues of intersectionality and inequality, as precarity, risk and harms are experienced unevenly. There are age and gendered differences, including where working from home is in conflict with concurrent caring and home schooling responsibilities. These issues and changes, their meaning and collateral consequences, urgently warrant sociological analysis.

AB In this commentary we provide a selective overview of the kinds of insights that a sociology of expertise can provide in better articulating the stakes of current politico-epistemic conflicts catalysed by COVID-19. In doing so, we argue that one of the ways that sociology can fruitfully engage with the pre-, intra- and post-pandemic societal responses is through its distinctive perspective on expertise. To exemplify the potential of this perspective, we present three dimensions of the pandemic that a sociology of expertise opens up avenues for exploring: (a) the formation of expert publics; (b) transnational expert dynamics; and (c) expert moral authority. Together these three dimensions show how expertise constitutes a crucial nexus for understanding how contemporary societies respond to global crises.

AB The Nordic countries are renowned for their unique administrative register data that include various aspects of an individual's labour market activities. However, studies of government-led help packages and their effects during the coronavirus crisis in Denmark reveal that the labour market statistics used by government and academics have several blind spots when it comes to some of the most vulnerable groups in the labour market. There are strong signs that we underestimate the scope and depth of atypical work and even lack reliable data. We argue in this piece that the coronavirus crisis is an important lesson for labour market sociology that calls for methodological development.

Through this expertise, it is possible to follow patterns of infections, fatalities and recoveries almost in real time, and this knowledge is crucial for countries when deciding on relevant governmental strategies to control the spread. The paper stresses that there was a strong institutional machinery of expertise for data production and dissemination, and despite rather different national ambitions in detection strategies (both concerning infections and mortalities), this machinery produced facts and figures as though they were measured uniformly.

AB Although marriage migration is an important route for immigration to Western Europe, little is known about how it is associated with the labour market trajectories of the minority populations involved. Using longitudinal population registry data on residents from a non-Western migrant background in Norway, this study compares the employment and earnings of those who 'marry back home', with those who find a spouse among Norwegian residents with the same national origin background. Following individuals up to 10 years before and after their first marriage (279,527 observations between 1993 and 2010), distributed fixed effects estimations suggest that the labour market trajectory is weaker in the years after marriage for those who have married marriage migrants, albeit the differences are small for men. For women from the first generation, marrying a marriage migrant is associated with lower employment and earnings, progressively declining with time. For women from the second generation, this relative decrease only holds for the labour earnings of employed women. Supplementary analyses indicate that the falling labour market trajectories of women marrying marriage migrants are related to lower educational attainment, higher fertility and stronger associations between motherhood and the labour market.

AB Previous research has shown that an advantaged social class position protects individuals from unemployment, but less is known about how this relationship has developed after the turn of the millennium, how it varies by gender and to what extent education contributes to the association between these factors. We assess these questions using register-based data on the Finnish labour force over a 28-year period between 1988 and 2015. The overall risk of unemployment was 2.7-3.7-fold among manual classes compared to upper non-manual classes, and 1.4-1.7-fold among lower compared to upper non-manual classes. Controlling for education attenuated the differences between social classes by about two-thirds. Social class disparities were somewhat more distinct among men than among women, but gender differences narrowed over time. Overall, temporal changes were small, especially among men, except for a curvilinear pattern observed for the relative unemployment risk of the lower non-manual class. To conclude, despite a comparatively egalitarian context and drastic changes in economic conditions and labour market structures over time, social stratification in unemployment has been substantial and considerably persistent. This is in line with the conceptualization of social class underpinning differing employment relations and, therefore, inherently creating variation in labour market risks.

AB This article investigates a mood change in local communities where new asylum seeker facilities were established in the wake of the "refugee crisis" in 2015. Whereas opinions in flux are often studied using quantitative data, this analysis takes advantage of in-depth qualitative interviews with inhabitants in selected Norwegian local communities after new temporary asylum reception centers were established. Qualitative data collected at this particular time provide the opportunity to gain insight intosocial processesoccurring in the wake of a sudden influx of immigrants. A key feature of the material is statements reflecting fear or nervous anticipation in relation to the period before the newcomers arrived, followed by descriptions of diminishing concern afterwards. Several studies have engaged with the issue of changes in public mood during this particular period, but few have analyzed changes at the local level. The study concludes that while the backdrop of impactful events that led to shifts in public mood at the national and regional levels played a role in informants'imagined encounterswith the newcomers,experiencingthe presence of the newcomers resulted in a subtle mood change of increased acceptance.

AB There is an ample body of research demonstrating the link between housing instability and adverse outcomes. The bulk of this research, however, largely relies on broad operationalizations, generally not considering different types of housing instability. This study extends previous research by focusing on adolescents facing a variety of residential events, including moves, imminent threats of eviction and forced relocations, while also considering the significance of distance. Adopting a counterfactual approach, and drawing on unique data on evictions in Sweden alongside a link to longitudinal registers, this study examines the association between housing instability and educational attainment, operationalized as graduation from upper secondary school. Theoretically, the study draws on the family stress model and theory on social capital, the findings providing support for both approaches. Single relocation was found to have a small impact on educational attainment, but forced relocations, repeated relocations and long-distance relocations are of particular significance for understanding the link between housing instability and educational outcomes. The study contributes to an understanding of the roles that different types of residential events play in youths' educational attainment, and policy implications are discussed.

AB An attractive explanation of the persistence of gender inequality in the division of domestic labor hinges on the role of culture. However, it is difficult to demonstrate the impact of cultural factors (e.g. social norms), as they are confounded with other institutional factors (e.g. social policies). This article deals with this issue by applying the emerging 'epidemiological approach' which focuses on international migrants as individuals who bring cultures differing from that prevailing in the national contexts in which they live. The study analyzes the gender division of housework of first- and second-generation immigrants living in countries covered by the second and fifth round of the European Social Survey. Applying cross-classified multilevel models and using several indicators of gender culture at both origin and destination, it is found that the female share of housework increases in couples when the man or the woman comes from a gender-traditional cultural background. The effect of culture is homogenous across destination countries and only partly explained by parental background. However, it tends to disappear among second generations.

ID STANDARD
AB How is art education valued in society? In Swedish public discourse the value of educational trajectories is often equated with their usefulness for employability. With competitive winner-takes-all labour markets for artists, art education is largely perceived as a worthless credential and form of education. But what kinds of worth does art education have among students themselves? This article draws on the approach of pragmatic sociology and individual and group interviews with 62 Swedish folk high school participants within the arts, to understand the meanings participants assign to post-compulsory education within the aesthetic realm. The students' accounts belong to three broad themes, where art education is described as: (a) being a 'stepping stone' to becoming an artist, (b) allowing them to have 'unique' experiences while being in a particular state of creativity or (c) offering them a chance to regain health and general well-being after a difficult period. These results are discussed in relation to the relative institutional autonomy the folk high school possesses in the Swedish education system, as well as the possibilities of challenging the hegemonic ideas of 'learning for earning' that largely reject non-instrumental regimes of self-discovery and artistic creativity.

ID INTERGENERATIONAL SOCIAL-MOBILITY; HEALTH CONSEQUENCES
AB This study explores individual and contextual explanations of why some people perceive themselves as being mobile and others do not. While subjective social position in recent decades has become an important topic of sociological enquiry, only a handful of studies explicitly investigate the nature of subjective perception of intergenerational mobility. When assessing their performance in comparison to their parents, individuals are likely to consider many other aspects of their lives than the attainment of socio-economic position. For empirical analysis, I operationalise an objective indicator of intergenerational mobility, often assumed to be the central explanation of perceptions of mobility, by means of intergenerational educational trajectories. In addition to exploring individual-level explanations, I use multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regression models to test how contextual environment is associated with perceived intergenerational mobility across 35 societies in Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia. Results indicate that an objective measure of intergenerational mobility and other individual-level factors are important explanations of subjective intergenerational mobility. Further, the difference in economic development between individuals' birth years and the year of interview is the most salient contextual factor explaining perceived intergenerational mobility, while contemporary economic development and short-term economic growth also reduce the likelihood of perceived downward mobility. The findings of this study contribute to sociological literature by highlighting the importance of contextual environment and factors beyond socio-economic characteristics for individuals' perception of intergenerational mobility.

ID INCOME INEQUALITY; IMMIGRATION
AB This paper explores the contested relationship between migration and income inequality, using labour migration to Norway as a case. The enlargements of the European Union starting in 2004 were followed by an unprecedented increase in labour migration to Norway. In particular, many rural regions, previously unfamiliar with immigration, have experienced a large influx of labour migrants. In the same period, income inequality has increased. This paper uses register data on the municipality level from 2005-2016 to discuss (a) the direction of the relationship between labour migration and income inequality; (b) the degree to which labour migration affects inequality (in general and within the native population) compared to other immigrant groups; and (c) whether the effects are different in rural and urban municipalities. Findings show that labour migration from the 'new' European Union countries is followed by higher income inequality in Norway. No support is found for the reversed causal relationship that increasing inequality causes higher numbers of labour migrants. The effect of labour migration on overall inequality is considerable, but not as strong as the effect of refugees. However, as opposed to refugees, labour migration also affects income inequality within the native population, but this effect is only significant in rural areas.

AB Vocational and academic curricula are said to hold both short-term and long-term consequences for economic outcomes. The literature on this topic, however, fails to address the long-term consequences of educational tracking. Just as important, this literature did not examine returns to high-school tracking within levels of further education. This paper aims to fill these gaps in the literature. Utilizing longitudinal data of Israeli men and women who graduated high school in the late 1980s and entered the labor market in the early 1990s, we examine their earning trajectories throughout age 50 in 2013. The results indicate that for men without college degrees, vocational education provides pay premiums at labor-market entry. With time, however, these earnings' premiums decline and diminish. A similar pattern characterizes degree holders, though the decline in the pay premiums is less steep when compared to men without a college degree. For women we do not find similar vocational effects. Taken together, our results indicate that the more substantial differences in earnings trajectories in Israel, among men and women alike, are associated with level of education and not with high-school tracks. The theoretical and potential policy implications of these findings are discussed.

DE Volunteering; social capital; wages; panel data
ID WORK; PARTICIPATION; BACK; JOB
AB Volunteering is an activity in which individuals work for free to benefit others; however, research has also focused on the benefits volunteers themselves might experience. We add to the literature by focusing on how not only volunteering itself has an impact on wages but how the intensity, duration and timing of volunteering also have an effect on these. In addition, we distinguish between the effects on volunteers in the same job and when changing a job, and test the role of social capital. Using German data from the Socio-Economic Panel, we find that current volunteering has positive effects on wages in a fixed effects wage regression, especially if individuals volunteer with low to medium intensity. The duration of volunteering does not increase wages. However, based on the dummy impact function, we find that volunteering increases wages almost immediately and that this effect remains fairly constant over time. We find no indication that reverse causality drives this effect. Furthermore, we show that the wage benefits of volunteering are realized only through job changes, not on-the-job wage progression. With regard to job changers, we show that social capital accumulation through volunteering is one reason explaining the observed wage effects.

AB This article explores the career effects of fixed-term employment among Polish youth, taking into account specific legal and institutional arrangements affecting both the incidence of temporary jobs and the chances of moving into more stable employment contracts. The aim of the analysis is twofold. First, it seeks to assess whether temporary contracts serve as a stepping-stone to stable employment or a trap leading to fragmented careers consisting of recurrent short-term jobs. Second, it identifies the factors which increase the chances of successful labour market integration. Both issues are addressed through a quantitative analysis of retrospective career data for a cohort of respondents aged 21-30 from two waves of the Polish Panel Survey (POLPAN), 2008 and 2013. Results suggest that temporary employment is not restricted to entry-level jobs and acts as a trap rather than a stepping-stone. In addition, the opportunities for moving from fixed-term to open-ended contracts appear to have deteriorated over the years. However, gaining early on-the-job experience, especially in occupations involving highly complex tasks, may improve the chances of attaining job stability.

AB This paper studies dynamically the direct effect of social origin on occupational destinations among men in Italy over the career. It aims at investigating the existence, the pattern over time and the heterogeneity of differences in occupational achievement related to social origins, net of education (DESO) and occupational allocation at first job. It also analyses if the change of the DESO over the career is related to the effect of specific job change episodes (voluntary job change, involuntary job change, internal career move). Results based on growth curve models show the relevance of first job in shaping the DESO, which also slightly increases over the career. The DESO is stronger among highly educated individuals, confirming a boosting pattern primarily driven by a better allocation at first job. The (smaller) DESO among the low-educated, increasing over the career, depends from the higher probabilities to benefit from voluntary and internal career job changes for the children of the service class. The (stronger) DESO among the highly educated is driven by the higher probabilities of experiencing internal career mobility for the children of the service class as well as by their ability to benefit also from an involuntary job change (e.g. dismissal).

AB The large proportion of dropout students from higher education has become a major concern in many industrialized countries. Despite consistent evidence of the association between social origin and dropout behaviour, it is unclear through which mechanisms social origin influences trajectories and educational outcomes in higher education, especially in countries with low financial costs for higher education studies. This study builds on the compensatory advantage mechanism to investigate the relationship between social origin, academic failure in higher education and dropout behaviour. Using a French longitudinal survey and event history analysis, results confirm that academic failure in the first year of higher education is a strong predictor of dropout, even after controlling for academic readiness for higher education. Supporting the compensatory advantage hypothesis, students from advantaged backgrounds are much less likely to drop out after academic failure than disadvantaged students and this result also holds for high-performing high-school graduates. These results stress the importance of taking into account the interplay between social origin and academic performance during higher education to reduce dropout behaviour.

AB Drawing upon ideas stemming from social disorganisation theory, this study explores how structural and social aspects of the school context affect youth substance-use behaviours in terms of smoking, alcohol and/or drug use. A key focus is to investigate the joint effect of school collective efficacy and schools' substance-use norms on students' substance use. Analyses are based on combined information from two independent data collections conducted in 2014 among ninth grade students (n = 5122) and teachers (n = 1105) in 81 senior-level schools in Stockholm. Results from multilevel analyses confirm previous research by suggesting that the proneness to engage in substance use varies depending on the socioeconomic profile of the school. Youth in socioeconomically advantaged schools were more prone to engage in substance use than youth in disadvantaged school settings. Furthermore, collective incentives for exerting social control against substance use seem to be weaker in schools where conventional values towards substance use (anti-substance-use norms) are suppressed.

AB Since the 1990s, most European countries have implemented activation policies targeting the unemployed. During the past decade, the target group for activation policies expanded and currently also includes persons with limitations in their ability to work due to long-term or chronic illness and disabilities. The argument underlying these policies is that labour-market exclusion is the main cause for social marginalization because participation in paid work provides important social and psychological functions that cannot be found elsewhere. Based on an extensive set of quantitative data that combines register data and survey data, and using structural equation modelling, this paper analyses the relationship between chronic illness and social marginalization, and in particular which role labour-market exclusion plays in this relationship. Is labour-market exclusion a crucial factor in explaining why individuals with chronic illnesses face a higher risk of social marginalization if factors such as income and education are also taken into account? From the statistical results, the paper states that individuals with chronic illnesses face a far higher risk of social marginalization, but that this risk is caused by their health limitations and not by their lack of labour-market participation. Contrary to the policies' logic and the theoretical argument of psycho-social theories originating from the deprivation perspective, no direct, indirect or mediating effects of labour-market exclusion on social marginalization were identified.

AB In countries with wide income differentials, food insecurity leads to substantial changes in everyday food practices and to poor dietary and mental health. Less is known about consequences of food budget pressure in affluent populations and in social-democratic welfare societies with narrower income differentials. This paper describes relations between pressure on household food budgets and demographic factors in Denmark. It asks how budgetary constraint relates to life satisfaction and dietary health and how these relationships are affected when people adapt their food practices to manage pressure on budgets. Data from a representative 2015 survey of Danish households are employed. Levels of food budget pressure vary with income and household composition and are negatively associated with life satisfaction and dietary health. We find a sequence of food practice adaptations where changes in food quality and hospitality, and seeking external help were being made when adjustments to food provisioning and kitchen practices were proving to be insufficient. We conclude that in affluent social-democratic welfare societies pressure on food budgets also has negative impacts on life satisfaction and health. Food budget pressure should be monitored in the future and addressed in public health policy.

AB The paper investigates the mechanisms of antifeminist communication norms, both on a theoretical and empirical level. Applying the concept of 'cultural codes' to the study of antifeminism we argue that statements denouncing feminism are often used as a signal to communicate a more general authoritarian worldview and an opposition towards 'political correctness'. In the empirical part we present a factorial survey design applied to a German sample. This design is used to experimentally vary four situational characteristics which hypothetically influence whether individuals comply with antifeminist communication norms: (a) the gender of the speaker, (b) the topic of the conversation, (c) the personal attributes of the mentioned 'feminist', and (d) the type of sexism (benevolent vs hostile) articulated. The study shows that compliance with antifeminist communication norms increases if respective statements are voiced by women instead of men, especially if respondents report higher social status. Antifeminist norm compliance is also higher if men instead of women mention sexual harassment accusations of feminists. For left respondents, compliance increases if benevolent instead of hostile sexism is articulated. Intersituational person-related factors of antifeminist communication which we observed are: authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, and distrust in public and political institutions.

AB This article maps the unexplored terrain of representations of refugees in Russian media, using discourse theory and the concepts of subject positions and symbolic boundaries to analyse these representations. The research questions are: Who are the refugees? What discourses do they feature in? What kinds of symbolic boundaries do these representations maintain? This study analyses the three Russian newspapers Izvestija, Novaya gazeta and Rossiiskaya gazeta, focusing on how, between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2015, these newspapers came to employ the term 'refugee' for persons from Ukraine and for those from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Analysis of the subject position of 'refugee' in discourses about security, humanitarianism, integration and nationalism reveals contrasting images of refugees from Ukraine and MENA refugees. The latter are represented as 'threatening' and 'alien': symbolic boundaries are maintained between Russians and these refugees as well as between 'superior' Russia and 'inferior' Europe. In contrast, refugees from Ukraine are often presented as similar to Russians. Nationalist discourse merges with security, humanitarian and integration discourses, creating contrasting symbolic boundaries between these two groups of refugees and Russians. Refugees are classed as 'preferred' or 'non-preferred' migrants on the basis not of their situation, but their ethnicity.

ID WAGE SUBSIDIES
AB Active labour market policies (ALMPs) are widely diffused measures aiming to re-integrate jobseekers into the labour market. Despite their crucial role in acting as gatekeepers to employment, the literature scarcely considers the employer's perspective of these measures. We analysed whether and how employers consider ALMP participation in the hiring process as a signal that helps explain the labour market outcomes of jobseekers. We developed a theoretical argument regarding how employers interpret ALMP participation and identify assumed agency, that is, whether employers believe that the agency for initiating ALMP participation lies with the jobseeker (voluntary participation) or the job centre (mandatory participation), as a crucial factor determining whether their evaluation of ALMPs is positive or negative. To examine our expectations, we conducted qualitative interviews with employers hiring for low-skilled occupations in Switzerland and Sweden, representing two countries with comprehensive ALMP systems. As expected, the interpretation of ALMP programmes differs depending on the assumed agency. Employers who believe that participation is voluntary interpret participation as a signal of motivation; however, employers who believe that participation is mandatory interpret participation as a signal of lower productivity, which reduces the chances of a successful labour market access.

AB In this paper, we examine the centrality of policy actors and moral justifications in media debates on Arctic climate change in Finland and Canada from 2011-2015. We take a network approach on the media debates by analysing relations between the actors and justifications, using discourse network analysis on a dataset of 745 statements from four newspapers. We find that in both countries, governments and universities are the most central actors, whereas business actors are the least central. Justifications that value environmental sustainability and scientific knowledge are most central and used across actor types. However, ecological justifications are sometimes in conflict with market justifications. Government actors emphasize new economic possibilities in the Arctic whereas environmental organizations demand greater protection of the vulnerable Arctic. Ecological justifications and justifications that value international cooperation are more central in the Finnish debate, whereas justifications valuing sustainability and science, as well as those valuing national sovereignty, are more central in the Canadian debate. We conclude that in addition to the centrality of specific policy actors in media debates, the use of different types of moral justifications also reflects political power in the media sphere.

AB This paper disaggregates non-institutional political engagement into three distinct repertoires of activism: collective, communicative and individualised forms. I evaluate the claim that non-institutional activism is more inclusive than traditional forms of political engagement by measuring the relative effects of typical predictors of participation, including resources, values and contextual measures, on different repertoires of non-institutional engagement. The findings suggest that individualised engagement is more accessible to women but stratified by resources and national wealth. Collective engagement is more accessible to people from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds but is stratified by gender, with women less likely to engage.

AB In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the importance of addressing the impact of both policy context and individual factors, as well as the interaction between the two, to explain inequalities between social groups. This paper uses data from the European Social Survey 2010 to examine how partnered mothers' work-family conflict varies with educational level and child care for children 0-2 years old. The study uses multilevel methods and adjusts for several work-related factors, such as occupation, non-standard working hours and flexible schedule, as well as the partner's time spent on paid and unpaid work. The results show that more educated mothers experience higher work-family conflict than less educated mothers do. The difference can be explained in full by work-related characteristics. Stratified analyses show that child care lowers the conflict, but only for the less educated mothers. In fact, child care seems to increase the conflict for more educated mothers of very young children. Furthermore, a positive interaction effect indicates larger educational differences in work-family conflict in countries with extensive child care. The present study underscores the importance of recognizing the intersection of education and family policy, as they both play an important role for work-family conflict.

AB In this article, first, we present new evidence on a specific type of compensatory advantage (CA) mechanism in educational transitions and attainment, whereby students from socio-economically advantaged families compensate the negative event of achieving poor grades by ignoring them and disproportionally moving on to the next level of education. Using two independent data sources, we focus on the attainment of an upper secondary degree and the transition from high school to university in Italy, investigating the role of parental education and social class in compensating for an early poor academic performance. Second, we develop a simulated scenario analysis to assess how much of the observed social background inequality is due to the educational outcomes of poorly performing students from high social backgrounds. The results are consistent with the notion that a CA mechanism is in place and show that the advantage of individuals with higher backgrounds over those from lower backgrounds is much larger among students with bad marks in earlier school stages. We estimate that at least one-third of the observed social background inequality in educational transitions in Italy can be attributed to the CA mechanism. This result is consistent across different outcomes, samples and birth cohorts, and is robust to a number of sensitivity checks.

AB Educational tracking amplifies social inequalities in a wide range of outcomes. From an institutional perspective, the current study examines whether this holds for educational disparities in general health. To investigate this question, we use information from the European Social Survey (Rounds 1-8: 2002-2016) for individuals between the ages of 18 and 45 years (N = 99,771) in 22 European countries. The estimated three-level hierarchical models indicate that tracking is indeed associated with larger educational inequalities in overall health. Individuals who have attained vocational education fare worse in terms of general health than do individuals who have pursued academic qualifications. However, the strength of association is much higher in countries with highly tracked systems (e.g. Germany and Czech Republic) than it is in countries with more comprehensive systems (e.g. the United Kingdom and Scandinavian countries). This result suggests that health inequalities between educational groups can be reduced by reorganizing secondary educational systems.

AB With a focus on the immigrant population, this study examines how the association between a relative income position and life satisfaction varies when the comparison group changes. Drawing data from Understanding Society in the UK between 2009 and 2015, this study first shows that after migration, income comparisons with the mainstream and co-ethnic groups in the host country matter more than that with the source-country population for one's life satisfaction. Furthermore, the relevance of comparison groups to life satisfaction varies across immigrant generations. Income comparison with the source-country population is more relevant to life satisfaction of the 1st generation, whereas 1.5 and 2nd generations consider income comparisons within the host country more relevant. In particular, favourable income comparison with the mainstream group in the host country is the most relevant to life satisfaction of the 2nd-generation, followed by the 1.5-generation, and last by the 1st-generation immigrants.

AB The aim of this study is to analyse the factors determining the ethnic affiliation of children born to interethnic native couples in Finland, using data from couples with one Finnish-speaking and one Swedish-speaking partner, between 1988 and 2014. In addition to individual characteristics of each partner and contextual factors, we also consider the role of couple characteristics. We look at the affiliation of the first child, as well as the combined affiliation of the first two children, in order to analyse how often children from the same parents are affiliated to different ethnicities. Around 60% of first- and second-born children of interethnic couples born between 1988 and 2014 were affiliated to the Swedish-speaking minority. The affiliation of the second child seldom differs from that of the first. Children of mixed couples with a Swedish mother are more likely to be affiliated to the Swedish-speaking community. Boys are more likely than girls to be affiliated to the father's community, and vice versa. In line with our expectations based on ethnic awareness, preference for cultural plurality and parental aspirations, the multivariate analysis shows a strong positive association between parental education level and the likelihood of the first child being Swedish speaking. The analysis also indicates that bargaining is not an important strategy when choosing a child's ethnic identity.

AB Scholars have taken a considerable interest in how global immigration to Europe generates public concern, but we still know little about the role that migration from within the European region has in fueling apprehensions. To better understand this, I examine how public attitudes towards immigration have responded to migration following the European Union's most extensive enlargement along its eastern border in 2004. Using recent advances in multilevel modeling, this article analyzes the longitudinal, cross-sectional relationship between east-west internal European migration on public attitudes towards the economic and cultural aspects of immigration in Western Europe using individual-level data from the European Social Survey (2004-2014). The results demonstrate that growing populations of Central and Eastern European foreigners have contributed to Western Europeans' perception of immigration as an economic threat, even when taking into account simultaneous immigration from outside Europe. Moreover, the relationship between east-west immigration and an individual's perception of immigration as a threat is conditional upon their socio-economic status. These findings underscore how within-European immigration in Western Europe has become consequential to the public's attitudes about immigration more generally.

AB The aim of this paper is to examine the link between associational involvement and political participation among youth in Norway and how this link varies between boys and girls of an immigrant or non-immigrant background. We examine the relationship between activities in instrumental and expressive types of voluntary organizations. The paper draws on the survey Ung i Oslo 2015 (Young in Oslo 2015), which was carried out among students in almost all high schools (30 schools) in Oslo, Norway. The results indicate that those who are actively involved in socially oriented organizations are most likely to participate in politics. However, the relationship between organizational activity and political participation is often stronger among youth of immigrant background and is visible even among those who are active in less socially oriented organizations. Most notably, the results suggest that being active in a sports organization is positively related to political participation among immigrant youth. We found no such effect among non-immigrant youth. In accordance with Robert Putnam's theoretical framework on social capital, the paper discusses why youth of immigrant background seem to benefit more, politically speaking, from associational involvement.

AB The increase in non-marital childbearing has coincided with educational expansion, although non-marital childbirths are more common among the low-educated population. This article quantifies the contribution of changes in education-specific rates of non-marital childbearing and educational distribution of parents to increases in non-marital childbearing among Finnish first-time parents over the period 1970-2009. Using Finnish register data on first-time mothers (N = 112,730) and fathers (N = 108,812), the study decomposes changes in the proportion of non-marital first childbearing in pairwise comparisons of successive decades for four educational segments: low educated (International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) 0-2), medium educated (ISCED 3-4), lower tertiary educated (ISCED 5-6) and upper tertiary educated (ISCED 7-8). The findings show that the increase in non-marital first-time births was mainly attributable to the large population of medium-educated women and men and the growing segment of lower tertiary-educated women. The highest proportion of non-marital first-time childbearing remained among the low-educated population, but diminishing group size meant their overall contribution was small. The growing upper tertiary-educated population increased its contribution to non-marital childbearing but still exhibited the lowest non-marital childbearing rates. We conclude that the medium-educated population merits increased scholarly attention for its important contribution to population-level changes.

SO ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
DE Bourdieu; field; legitimate sociology; professors; scientific elite
ID KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION; SWEDISH SOCIOLOGY
AB This qualitative study explores how sociology is legitimated among established Finnish and Swedish sociology professors, who are conceived as a scientific elite. Drawing on a Bourdieusian framework, the analysis traces the discourses that define legitimate sociology in these two national contexts, and the relations between those discourses. While the scientific elite of Finnish and Swedish sociology share four discourses - the Excellence, Humboldtian, Emancipatory and Policy discourses - the relative value of each differs between the different national contexts. The Excellence discourse dominates in the Finnish data, while the Humboldtian discourse is dominant in the Swedish data. The emphases on the other two discourses also vary: in Finnish interviews, the Policy discourse holds a strong position, while the Emancipatory discourse is articulated only with nostalgia; in Swedish interviews, the Emancipatory discourse is strong and the Policy discourse is weak. The results show that different national contexts produce variations in sociology's internal dynamics.

AB This study investigates whether there are differences in informal social capital between people with a chronic illness and healthy individuals. We also test to what extent this relationship is mediated by individual characteristics and moderated by country-level characteristics. In contrast to previous research, we use representative recent and high-quality data from the European Social Survey of 2012 as well as multilevel analysis. Our results demonstrate that chronically ill people have less informal social capital, all across Europe. Individual characteristics, including depression, subjective health, and perceived income, mediate this relationship almost fully. Welfare regimes and the amount of money countries spend on health care moderate the relationship between chronic illness and informal social capital.

   expertise; religion; social groups
AB As a part of their normative theory of expertise, Harry Collins and Robert Evans proposed that interactional expertise forms the third kind of knowledge, located between formal propositional knowledge and embodied skills. Interactional expertise refers to the capability to grasp the conceptual structure of another's social world, and it is expressed as the ability to speak fluently the language spoken in that social world. According to their theory, it is a key concept of sociology, because it refers to the understanding and coordination of joint actions between members of different social groups. Collins and Evans have further claimed that minority social group members tend to outpace majority social group members in terms of interactional expertise. Drawing on ethnomethodology, we detail the ways in which interactional expertise is displayed and revealed in experiments. This allowed us to specify the underlying reasons for the distribution of interactional expertise between social groups. Our results indicate that the difference between the groups depends on whether a group is either actively maintained or a passive latent category, because interactional expertise provides for not only the crossing of social boundaries but also their maintenance. The minority social group members' greater interactional expertise or competence is therefore proven to be illusory.

AB Drinking stories feature widely in Western societies. Many people eagerly share their stories in the aftermath of drinking events. These stories are also common in books, movies, music and the media. Based on qualitative interviews with 104 young Norwegian heavy episodic drinkers, the article seeks to establish drinking stories as a distinct narrative genre. We argue that this narrative genre of drinking stories comes from an oral storytelling tradition which uses transgressions to trigger interest, entertain, and challenge commonly held views. These transgressions typically come in the form of playful violations of conventions and common sense and tend to centre around five classic themes: sex, bodily harm, bodily fluids, lawbreaking and pranks. While often dismissed as trivial, vulgar and of little literary value, drinking stories are highly valued by many people and have significant consequences for how people experience drinking and behave while being drunk.

AB The strong link between parental socioeconomic status (SES) and children's success in school is well established. However, mechanisms that underpin this association remain a major issue in current research on social inequality. Using data from the Families in Germany Study and structural equation modelling, this study demonstrates that parenting styles and child behavioural problems explain, in part, the association between parental SES and child school grades for mathematics and German between the ages of 9 and 10. We found that parents with a low SES are more likely to be inconsistent in their parenting and to use psychological control with their children more often, these two factors being linked to child behavioural problems. Adverse parenting and behavioural problems are, in turn, associated with low school grades. Our findings also show that behavioural problems in children are associated with lower school grades independent of parenting style. These findings suggest that parenting styles and child behavioural problems and their interplay may be potential pathways that underpin the influence of parental SES on children's school achievement.

AB Siblings form the strongest horizontal family tie, which often involves life-long emotional closeness and various forms of support. Similarity is often assumed to strengthen sibling relations, but existing evidence is scarce and mixed. Using data from the Generational Transmissions in Finland surveys collected in 2012, we employ both total and sibling fixed-effect regressions and examine whether sibling similarity is associated with relationship quality in two family generations: an older generation born in 1945-1950, and the generation of their children, born in 1962-1993. We study sibling similarity in gender, age, financial condition and parenthood status and measure relationship quality by contact frequency, emotional closeness and provision of practical help. In both generations, being of the same gender was associated with all relationship measures. Age similarity was also associated with more contacts and increased emotional closeness in the younger generation, and differences in parenthood status with increased provision of practical help in the older generation. In most aspects, however, sibling similarity was not associated with relationship quality. While sibling relations tend be strong in contemporary Finland, this is only partly due to similarity effects.

AB Demographic explanations for the rise in household income inequality include increased educational assortative mating and changes in the division of paid labour within families. Building on this research, the current study focuses on the connected nature of these two inequality-producing mechanisms, while at the same time bridging the divide with the economic literature on the role of income differentiation. Drawing on the 2004-2008 European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, we consider variation across Europe in the disequalising effect of educational assortative mating and relate these patterns to the general characteristics of welfare state regimes, focusing on the degree of gender equality and income differentiation. First, we document large educational differentials in men's and women's income in Eastern Europe, and smaller differentials in Anglo-Saxon, Continental and, especially, Northern Europe. Next, we find that this variation in gender equality and income differentiation parallels variation in the potential contribution of educational assortative mating to educational differentiation in household income. While all countries display larger educational differentials in household income under the scenario of 100% educational homogamy, the biggest differences are found in Eastern Europe, and the smallest differences in the Nordic countries. These results suggest that educational assortative mating is less disequalising in countries with more gender equality and support for equal opportunities.

AB Research on intergenerational social mobility tends to focus on examining the level of overall social fluidity in society. However, from a social justice perspective it can be argued that the type of social fluidity that matters most is upward mobility from the lowest rung of the social ladder. This article examines the labour market chances of children from parents in unskilled working-class positions, relative to children from skilled working-class and higher social class backgrounds, and how they have changed across four birth cohorts in post-WWII Germany. We find that individuals from unskilled working-class backgrounds have substantially lower labour market chances than individuals from skilled working-class backgrounds or higher social class backgrounds. Moreover, we find that the gap in labour market chances between individuals from unskilled working-class backgrounds and individuals from more advantaged backgrounds has not narrowed but, if anything, has widened across the four birth cohorts we examine. Our results suggest that an important factor underlying this sustained labour market inequality is a persistently high level of educational inequality between these groups.

AB Parental time with children is important for children's developmental outcomes. Family type may affect the amount of time parents can and will invest in children. Using time-use panel data obtained from two waves of the Danish Time Use Survey, linked with administrative records, the study shows that parental family type had a substantial impact on the time parents spent with children. When controlling for constant unobserved individual traits, likely to affect both time-use and family type, differences in time-use increase, indicating positive selection into non-intact family types. Single parents and parents in reconstituted families spent less time on developmental activities, such as talking, reading and playing with the child, whereas parents living in reconstituted families also spent less time on non-developmental activities, such as transporting the child or performing basic childcare. Based on our findings, there are indications that cross-sectional results showing little difference in parents' involvement in children across family types partly emanate from differential selection in family types.

AB Aggregated data on regions within countries have been used to analyze the effect of religion and religiosity on aggregate support for redistribution. The data are from the International Social Survey Programme and a panel data set was constructed at the level of regions that were observed several times over the period 1985-2010. Empirical analyses show that a higher share of Catholics within a region has a positive effect on aggregate support for redistribution; a higher share of Protestants has a negative effect; religiosity (measured by church attendance) has no effect; and the effect of a religious denomination is non-linear and depends on whether or not it has a weak or a strong presence in a region. It was also found that Scandinavia is unusual in combining a high share of Protestants with high aggregate support for redistribution.

ID COLLECTIVE MEMORY; POLITICS
AB This article takes a sociological perspective on the phenomenon of national myth making in collective memory. It develops an original theoretical concept, the ghost hero. The ghost hero, we posit, is a reinvented historical actor who, despite being implicated in acts of moral or legal turpitude, is elevated and venerated within national communities. In building a theoretical frame, we use two historical cases: Latvian aviator and Nazi-era collaborator Herberts Cukurs, and Marshall Ion Antonescu, pro-fascist leader of Romania in World War II. Our concept draws on the microsociological theory of Erving Goffman to characterize a historical narrative as the presentation of a national "self" and the structural functionalist perspective to examine the sociological functions of the ghost hero for state and society. We suggest that the ghost hero concept could extend beyond these cases and regions to analyze the heroization of historical figures implicated in atrocities.

AB This article examines how the military engagement in Afghanistan has been framed in the Norwegian public sphere and by veterans who have participated on the ground. Drawing on public documents and personal interview data, the analysis demonstrates how different frames were used in the public and private spheres to convey the meaning of the operation. The analysis focuses in particular on the mismatch experienced by the veterans between the official framing of the operation as a humanitarian endeavor, and their perception of having been at war. In the discussion of the findings, we argue that the study sheds light on broader questions concerning the place of contemporary soldiers in Western societies, where people in general have become largely detached from the direct experience of warfare.

AB This article examines the public speeches presented by George W. Bush and Jens Stoltenberg in the aftermath of, respectively, the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and 22 July 2011. By using a novel combination of cognitive linguistics and the strong programme in cultural sociology, I demonstrate how one metaphor system fundamentally shaped the speeches of both national leaders, a system I term The Fight for Freedom and Democracy. The article shows how this system can be seen as the source of both the similarities and differences in the speeches of Bush and Stoltenberg. Both leaders describe a metaphorical struggle between the national community and the terrorist(s), but Bush escalates this struggle to a War on Terror, while Stoltenberg's only 'weapons' in this battle are democratic ideals. Building on these findings, the article discusses how the different discourses of good and evil might be an integral part of the responses to terrorism.

ID POST-BUREAUCRACY; MANAGEMENT
AB According to European comparative studies, organisational change and restructuration have been especially prevalent in Nordic countries. In particular, public-sector organisations have been under turbulence due to pressures for cost reduction and increased efficiency. Yet, not much is known about how these changes have affected the organisation of everyday work. Based on the three waves of European Working Conditions surveys (2000, 2005, 2010), this paper analyses the change in the organisation of work in Nordic countries. The aim is to look into types of work organisation in public- and private-sector organisations in Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. The questions asked are how the type of work organisation differs between sectors and to what extent are there changes in the prevalence of work organisation types. According to the results, the trend is a move away from the use of forms of work organisation characterised by high levels of learning and autonomy to more constrained or formalised forms. However, differences were also found between countries and sectors. The formalisation of work (i.e. features characteristic especially of the lean model of work organisation) is more common in the public sector and in Finland and Denmark compared to Sweden.

ID YOUNG-PEOPLE; WELFARE; UNEMPLOYMENT; WORKFARE; DENMARK; FRANCE
AB Activation policies form the core of employment policies in most OECD countries. They are part of 'active' welfare states and associated neoliberal forms of governance that seek to govern through freedom by producing self-governing and responsible subjectivities. Ethnographies of governmentalities have been used in the research reported in this article to examine if and how such subjectivities are put in practice in street-level encounters in local welfare delivery. Based on an ethnographic research of youth services in the Public Employment Services (PES) in Helsinki, Finland, it is shown that despite the policy focus on active citizenship the street-level practice entails not only liberal ideas of self-governing individuals but also authoritarian measures. What is governed in the meetings is not the young people's selves but their time and behaviour. In the process, the notion of active citizenship is emptied and transformed to mean participation in supervised activities offered by the PES. Such practice also reworks the temporal structures and creates insecure and eventful experience of time for PES clients. In contrast to governing through freedom, the localized interpretation of activation policies represents the authoritarian and paternalistic side of neoliberal governance.

AB Research on couple bargaining and housework allocation focuses almost exclusively on partners' economic resources. In this study, we ask whether additional bargaining resources, namely physical appearance and social networks, may exert a distinct effect - that is, whether partners can mobilize multiple resources within their bargaining framework. A focus on multiple bargaining chips is made possible by the German Socio-Economic Panel Study. In line with previous research, we conclude that earnings potential is the most important bargaining chip. But we also find that physical attractiveness can make a significant difference, although its effects depend on age. We uncover no distinct effects for social networks.

   forum; inequality; neo-liberalism
ID ATTITUDES
AB This paper uses innovative democratic forums carried out in Germany, Norway, and the United Kingdom to examine people's ideas about welfare-state priorities and future prospects. We use a moral economy framework in the context of regime differences and the move towards neo-liberalism across Europe. Broadly speaking, attitudes reflect regime differences, with distinctive emphasis on reciprocity and the value of work in Germany, inclusion and equality in Norway, and individual responsibility and the work-ethic in the UK. Neo-liberal market-centred ideas appear to have made little headway in regard to popular attitudes, except in the already liberal-leaning UK. There is also a striking assumption by UK participants that welfare is threatened externally by immigrants who take jobs from established workers and internally by the work-shy who undermine the work-ethic. A key role of the welfare state is repressive rather than enabling: to protect against threats to well-being rather than provide benefits for citizens. UK participants also anticipate major decline in state provision. In all three countries there is strong support for continuing and expanding social investment policies, but for different reasons: to enable contribution in Germany, to promote equality and mobility in Norway, and to facilitate self-responsibility in the UK.

AB What motivates welfare attitudes during economic crises? While existing research highlights self-interest, this conclusion rests on a predominant conceptualization of citizens' crisis experiences as personal job loss. However, during economic downturns, people are likely to also witness colleagues or distant others being laid off, which might affect welfare attitudes for reasons beyond self-interest. This article analyses how personal job loss as well as that of colleagues and acquaintances during the Great Recession is related to welfare attitudes in the UK, Germany and Sweden, where welfare regimes and crisis policies differ systematically. Based on Eurobarometer data from 2010, the findings reveal that the importance of personal job loss as well as that of colleagues and acquaintances varies cross-nationally. In the liberal UK - with its modest crisis response - demand for greater public welfare provision is associated with personal job loss. In social-democratic Sweden - with its active crisis management - demand for greater welfare provision is associated with acquaintances' job loss. In conservative Germany - with its labour market insider-focused crisis response - no clear picture emerges. These findings support a sociological perspective emphasizing the importance of other-regarding concerns for welfare attitudes and the role of institutions in structuring people's self-interest and normative orientations.

AB The central aim of this paper is identifying the existing political leeway for the reduction of deprivation levels in Europe. The links between household and individual characteristics and risks of material deprivation have been abundantly researched, but what are the political institutions that modify and possibly buffer these odds? Welfare state differences have been portrayed in depth but their association with social outcomes such as deprivation is less clear. By identifying the impact of decommodification and defamilisation policies on deprivation exposure, we seek to fill this gap. Our results, based on European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions 2012 to 2013 cross-sectional micro data, reveal that social programmes that cover large segments of the population and follow a needs-based approach are linked to lower odds of being materially deprived. A significant number of European cross-country differences in deprivation rates can thus be traced back to varying levels of social assistance, as well as to differences in the provision of public healthcare. Defamilisation policies are, despite increased risks for (single parent) families, not yet addressing the problem of low living standards successfully. An extension of childcare services, however, seems promising for lowering deprivation among families, particularly in countries with high levels of involuntary part-time work.

AB Income inequality has grown in many countries over the past decades. Single country studies have investigated how trends in family demography, such as rising female employment, assortative mating and single parenthood, have affected this development. But the combined effects have not been studied sufficiently, much less in a comparative perspective. We apply decomposition and counterfactual analyses to Luxembourg Income Study data from the 1990s and 2000s for West Germany and the USA. We counterfactually analyse how changes in the distribution of men's and women's education, employment and children across households between the 1990s and 2000s affected overall inequality (Theil index). We find that changes in family demography between the 1990s and the 2000s explain inequality growth in West Germany but not in the USA, where the effects of gendered changes in education and employment offset each other. In West Germany, changes in the distribution of household types, and particularly changes in men's employment and education, contributed to increases in income inequality. The country differences in the relationship between changes in family demography and inequality growth reflect how the decline in men's and the growth in women's employment played out differently in the weakening male breadwinner context in West Germany and in the universal breadwinner context in the USA.

AB The 'microclass' approach advocated by Grusky, Weeden and colleagues emphasises fine-grained occupational differences and their relevance to social reproduction and social mobility. Using recent developments in historical occupational classifications, we adopted a microclass approach to the analysis of intergenerational social mobility using linked census data for Norway and the USA in the late 19th and early 20th century (1850-1910). We describe a procedure that offers an operationalisation of microclass units for these datasets, and show how its application enables us to disentangle different forms of immobility which would not be distinguished in other approaches. Results suggest that microclass immobility is an important part of social reproduction in both Norway and the United States during the era of industrialisation. Both countries reveal a similar balance between 'big class' and 'microclass' immobility patterns. In Norway, the relative importance of microclasses in social reproduction regimes, when compared to the role of 'big class' structures, seems to decline very slightly over the course of industrialisation; but in the USA the relative importance of microclasses seems if anything to increase over the period.

AB To bring empirical scrutiny to the often very general and theory-driven debates on cultural globalization and to broaden the geographical scope of previous studies on the topic, this paper presents an analysis of the changes in the relative weight of national and global culture in the culture sections of quality European newspapers from 1960 to 2010. Through content analysis of newspaper articles, the paper examines how the composition of geographical origin of the cultural products discussed has changed over a half-century. The paper asks whether globalizing trends exist in newspaper coverage of culture or whether coverage of national culture remains dominant; to what degree is there variation, based on the art form discussed; and whether newspapers embedded in their national contexts differ from each other in these respects. The results show only a moderate increase in coverage of global products. However, clear trends were found that are associated with both the geographical origin of cultural products and the art forms discussed in the articles, highlighting that post-1960s cultural globalization is best understood as being intertwined with the rise of popular culture and the corresponding decline of traditional - and very European - highbrow culture.

AB This article explores how international references in parliaments build a synchronized world polity, even in countries that are often portrayed as being at odds with the rest of the world. The article asks whether and how Russian parliamentarians refer to the international community, and how such references compare with parliamentary debates in other countries. The "mesophenomenological" argument developed here connects World Society Theory, which demonstrates global isomorphism, with national studies of Russia, which argue for important national particularities. The empirical analysis draws on a stratified random sample of debates on draft laws in the Russian Duma from 1994 to 2013, comparable to similar samples from six other countries. The results show that: (1) Russian parliamentarians refer to the international community in the same level and the same forms as in other countries; (2) Russian policy-makers rely on the same imageries of the social world to convince their audiences as do other parliamentarians; and (3) this similarity in form remains consistent throughout the period, despite radical changes in national politics. These findings attest to the Russian Duma as a site of world culture, and to the mesophenomenological view that the world polity is highly synchronized through discourses of cross-national comparisons.

AB Corporations use ties to other powerful organisations to influence the rules that structure their markets and the society in which they operate. The corporate interlocks created by board directors show how some corporations are more successful than others in integrating not only in the corporate world but also in other sectors. Neil Fligstein suggested that the best-organised and dominating corporations, or the incumbents, are the most successful in stabilising their markets. To explore the relationship between corporate networks and integration in other sectors in the setting of a small, open, but highly regulated economy, we analysed the intersection between the interlocking directorates among the top 1037 corporations in Denmark and seven other sectoral networks. We used a database containing 5079 affiliations and 56,536 positions, and show that the incumbents were better integrated across all sectors. The strong correlation between sectoral integration and turnover was deconstructed and an independent effect of prominence, or symbolic capital, was found. This suggests that when creating affiliations within and outside the corporate world it is not only the economic size that matters, but also the prestige of the firm.

ID COLLECTIVE EFFERVESCENCE
AB The article proposes a comparison of Durkheim's and Habermas's views about public communication and democratic deliberation. They seem to share an understanding that democratic deliberation requires support from the public sphere. Nonetheless, Durkheim believed that rational public communication must gain strength from ceremonies, whereas Habermas essentially focused on communicative rationality and rational discourse within the public sphere. The article thus asks whether Habermas's theory of rational discourse implies a rationalist fallacy, largely because he offers no plausible explanation of the way in which social actors are emotionally motivated to participate in rational discourses, rather than resorting to violence and manipulation. Could Durkheim's view about public communication, and its need to gather strength from collective ceremonies and collective sentiments, resolve this theoretical conundrum in that Durkheim's view is complementary to Habermas's?

ID ABSTRACTION
AB This analysis of the work of George Herbert Mead and Alfred Sohn-Rethel compares their respective accounts of the formation of the self. The analysis proceeds from two important similarities: the effort to understand self-consciousness not as primordial but as the product of social processes, and the view that these processes form a circuit: the self arises from consciousness' return to itself, concluding a movement whereby consciousness is first externalized onto objects and then internalized, taking on the insular shape of self-consciousness. What sets the two accounts apart is the site from whence the self returns: objects. In Mead, the self returns from meaningful objects, and this same (intersubjective) meaning is entangled with the process of self-formation. In contrast, for Sohn-Rethel, the self returns from objects whose meaning is not established intersubjectively but objectively: the self is the unintended consequence of commodity exchange. In Mead, interaction among people affords meaning to objects and thus evokes the self; in Sohn-Rethel, interaction among commodities evokes an objective meaning that renders people as selves. Interpretative sociology should attend to the objectively and unconsciously meaningful forms analyzed by Sohn-Rethel. To illustrate this conclusion, reference is made to a certain experience of the social under neoliberalism.

AB Individuals with a higher social position are more tolerant of current income inequality than individuals with a lower social position. Besides this, attitudes towards income inequality are influenced by inequality-legitimising myths in a given society. Little is known about how these two factors interact. This study combines these two lines of research and argues that different social strata are more polarised in their attitudes towards inequality in societies with strong prevalent meritocratic perceptions. We expect lower-status individuals (i.e. with a lower income or education) to experience a threat to their group esteem and therefore be less likely to support their society's inequalities in societies with such strong meritocratic perceptions. This hypothesis was tested using data from the International Social Survey Programme 2009 (Social Inequality) on 39 countries. The results show that different social strata are indeed more polarised in their attitudes towards inequality in societies where meritocratic perceptions are more prevalent. Our results are robust for income, but not for education. This suggests that in perceived meritocracies, people regard income as the primary indicator of effort and ability.

AB It is demonstrated that family policies are an important aspect of the institutional context of earnings inequality among coupled households. Although seldom integrated into prominent analyses of economic inequality, women's earnings are consistently found to reduce relative inequality among households. This means that family policies, as well-known determinants of women's employment and earnings, are important contextual determinants of economic inequality. Using Luxembourg Income Study data from 18 OECD countries in the period 1981-2008, this study demonstrates that women have higher earnings, and that their earnings reduce inequality among coupled households more in institutional contexts with generous paid leave and public childcare. We found no sizeable association between financial support policies, such as family allowances and tax benefits to families with children, and the degree to which women's earnings contribute to inequality among coupled households. Family policy arrangements that facilitate women's employment and earnings are associated with less economic inequality among coupled households.

ID FAMILY FRIENDLY POLICIES; GENDER; OPPORTUNITIES; EMPLOYMENT; CHALLENGE;

AB An examination of managers' perspectives on employees' parental leave rights is presented, drawing on qualitative interviews with 34 managers in the Norwegian police and in the legal profession. The aim of the article is to explore how managers approach employees' parental leave within different institutional logics and how their approach relates to gendered norms of good parenthood. According to these norms, parental leave is used fully, but mothers take the main share of the leave. The findings show that the managers do not necessarily perceive parental leave as a problem. However, the practical solutions the managers propose to possible challenges give important clues about what parental leave entails within the frame of different institutional logics. The managers' concerns reveal that parental leave rights may clash with central values, goals and strategies in an organisation. Within the logics of the police and private law firms, work is more individualised and thus perceived as more challenging than in the public sector law offices. When the solution suggested by the managers is for individual employees to adapt their leave, gendered norms come forward. However, the analysis also shows that gendered parenthood norms play out differently with the different institutional logics. With these insights, the analysis shows how policy regulations and local workplace contexts interact in shaping the consequences of family policies for gender equality in wages and career progression

ID HYPERMASCULINITY
AB Previous research has critiqued conventional anger management programmes for disregarding participants' values honouring masculine performances of being tough, risk-seeking and capable of violence. Conversely, the Danish programme subjected to case study in this paper, represents a liberal approach that endorses such values while still encouraging participants to reform their behaviour. We investigate this approach as a frame for participants' storytelling, that is, narrative presentations of past, present and future selves. Detailed narrative analysis demonstrates the counsellor's conveyance of a non-judgmental attitude, which indicates expectations that participants value practices such as fighting and using illegal drugs. We explain how the approach emerges as a gendered and classed frame which some participants may not align with, specifying how a participant who is unable or unwilling to adopt expectations may struggle to present as properly masculine. The study demonstrates that therapy which seeks to accommodate particular forms of masculinities may unintentionally marginalise some participants.

AB Country-case studies examining the relation between curricular tracking (ability sorting) in secondary education and civic and political engagement (CPE) have led to mixed findings. This calls for a comparative approach. Thus far, as a result of the available data, comparative studies examining the effect of curricular tracking on civic engagement have been cross-sectional in nature. In this paper, we introduce a longitudinal approach by drawing from two cross-sectional surveys with identical CPE measures for the same birth cohort before and after tracking (CIVED 1999, ISSP 2004 and EVS 2008). We examine the relation between the duration of curricular tracking and the development of CPE between the age of 14 and young adulthood in 25 countries. The results show that a longer tracked curriculum is negatively related to the development of civic and political engagement, particularly at the lower part of the distribution. Moreover, we find that the negative relation between length of the tracked curriculum and CPE is mediated by enrolment rates for higher education. This result suggests that tracking does not directly negatively affect civic and political engagement, but does so because it is associated with reduced participation in higher education.

AB The paper analyses political scandals connected to the contemporary populist parties of Denmark, Finland and Sweden. The dramaturgies of these scandals repeat the general patterns of political scandals identified in previous studies, but they also share special characteristics that make them a specific type of neo-populist scandal. The starting point of the typical neo-populist scandal occurs due to the moral transgression of a member of a populist movement, usually through the use of unacceptable language or behaviour, insulting non-native inhabitants or other minorities within the population. However, provocation and playing the role of the underdog are common strategies employed by populists, and a populist movement may even benefit from a scandal, though the consequences of the scandal depend on the life phase of the movement and on the status of the member involved in the scandal. The moral transgressions and political consequences of neo-populist scandals may serve as an indicator of the condition liberal democracy enjoys, but also reveal contextual differences in particular societies and their moral order.

AB This study explores the global diffusion of a new ethical consumption tactic named carrotmob. We trace the spread of carrotmobs from the US across six continents and compare cases of successful and unsuccessful national diffusion. We argue that the heterogeneous spread of carrotmobs cannot be explained solely by differences in individual characteristics of consumers, such as post-materialist value orientation or income, or in the economic opportunity structures, such as national affluence or the availability of environmental labeled goods. Results from semi-structured interviews with organizers and activists in 15 countries suggest that activist brokers relied on social media to influence mobilization, and that social movement organizations, mass media, and governmental organizations played an important role for the diffusion of those collective actions. Our results support theories of connective action and political opportunities, but contradict theories of statism.

AB World society theory argues that actor empowerment in local contexts is driven primarily by the expanding world culture, rendering alternative explanations weaker in comparison. This article explores one such alternative explanation and offers an account of actor empowerment which highlights the role of identity constructed in local interaction. The article imports insights from identity theory to show how identities constructed in interaction may complement those derived from the world culture. To explore the phenomenon of theoretical interest, the case of a historical empowerment of Serbian universities in the post-2000 period, as an actor in the national higher education governance, is considered.

AB Aspiring artists are uncertain about how their work's quality will be evaluated by gatekeepers on artistic markets. Learning to evaluate the quality of one's work and its prospects on the artistic market is central to artistic careers, yet often overlooked in research. An analysis of 47 interviews with aspiring writers in Sweden shows that they use what in this article is coined appraisal devices to deal with this market uncertainty. Appraisal devices offer trusted and knowledgeable appraisals of their work's chances of success and failure on the artistic market. Appraisals from assessors become appraisal devices when assessors are trusted and seen as knowledgeable about how works are evaluated on the artistic market and are able to produce such evaluations. Appraisals from competitions become appraisal devices when the writer sees the evaluation as reflecting how the writer's work will be evaluated on the artistic market. In contrast to judgment devices, which take the perspective of cultural consumption, appraisal devices take the perspective of cultural production. Aspiring artists use appraisal devices to deal with the uncertainty of their chances of success on the artistic market.

AB This article contributes to the discussion on flexible working by assessing empirically the prevalence of mobile, multi-locational work in Europe (EU-28, Norway and Switzerland). Drawing on data from the Sixth European Working Conditions Survey, the prevalence of multi-locational work across Europe is examined in terms of the knowledge intensity of the work. Knowledge-intensive occupations are characterised by a high level of individual skills, typically acquired through tertiary-level education, and a high degree of autonomy combined with frequent use of ICT. According to the results, working on mobile sites - a practice that augments working in the primary workplace - is most common in northern European countries, where the proportion of knowledge-intensive occupations is high. However, even in the Nordic region, knowledge workers predominantly work at their employers' premises. This finding is in marked contrast with the hyperbole and expectations which assume that ICT allows knowledge workers to work free from the constraints of time and space. Agriculture, construction and transport workers still represent the largest proportion of the mobile workforce. Knowledge-intensive job features, however, predict the adoption of working at home. The analysis adds to the literature on flexible working by taking into account both traditional and knowledge-intensive forms of multi-locational work as well as providing a cross-national comparison.

AB A widespread cultural phenomenon - and/or individual disposition - is the idea that one should never try to be more, try to be different, or consider oneself more valuable than other people. In Scandinavia this code of modesty is referred to as the 'Jante mentality', in Anglo-Saxon societies the 'tall poppy syndrome', and in Asian cultures 'the nail that stands out gets hammered down'. The study reported here examines how this modesty code relates to generalized trust. We argue, prima facie, that a positive and a negative relationship are equally plausible. Representative samples of the Norwegian population were asked about their agreement with the Jante mentality and the extent to which they have trust in other people. Two population surveys were conducted; one measuring individual level associations and another measuring aggregate level associations. It was found that the relationship between having a Jante mentality and trust is negative, at both levels of analysis and, furthermore, that the Jante mentality - this modesty code assumed to be instilled in Scandinavians from early childhood - is a powerful predictor of generalized trust.

ID DECISION
AB This study develops and tests the hypothesis that information biases concerning the perceived extent of risk of educational options fuel social inequalities in track choice. In particular, it is argued that low-educated families are more concerned than college-educated families with the risks of dropout in the academic track, even when their children perform well at school. Moreover, they overestimate the risks of low occupational outcomes associated with academic diplomas. These information biases enhance their propensity to select vocational tracks, which are perceived as safer options, even when their children have the potential to succeed in the academic path. Survey data from Italy were used to assess these misperceptions and experimental evidence is presented concerning their causal effect on track choices. To correct these misperceptions, we designed a light information intervention, which was nested in a longitudinal survey to assess the impact of this intervention on students' track choices. Both survey and experimental results corroborated our hypothesis that information biases contribute to social inequalities in track choice.

AB In this paper, we investigate how associations between personality traits and divorce have changed over time. Competing hypotheses are derived based on social exchange theory, crisis theory, and changing selection into marriage. A combination of retrospective and prospective data on marriages contracted between 1972 and 2009 is used from the British Household Survey (n = 4169), the Divorce in Flanders study (n = 4377), and the German Socio-Economic Panel (n = 8155). Discrete-time event history models are estimated to look at changes over time in the associations between the Big Five' personality traits and divorce. The results show generally similar associations between divorce and personality traits across Britain, Flanders and Germany, and display relatively little change over time. Divorce seems, in general, to have become characterized less by people who behave in unconventional ways (high openness to experience) and, to some extent, more by people that do not keep up social relations as much as others (low conscientiousness). These results are congruent with predictions derived from a social exchange perspective, where traits related to external barriers to divorce are expected to become less important as divorce becomes more common and less costly in social, legal and economic terms.

AB Women have much higher sickness absence rates than men. One prominent hypothesis is that this is a result of gender segregation in the labour market and the differences in employment or working conditions that follow from this. Previous studies assessing this idea give mixed results, but they do not take into account the possibility of selection effects. Long-term health differences between individuals may, for instance, influence both what jobs people end up in and their levels of sickness absence. In this paper, we provide new evidence on employment and working conditions as a cause of gender differences in sickness absence. We use individual fixed-effect models to account for selection based on stable individual characteristics. Like several previous studies, we find a U-shaped relationship with high absence in both male- and female-dominated occupations. However, the fixed-effect models show that this relationship is primarily caused by overrepresentation of absence-prone individuals in female-dominated occupations. Accounting for selection, the association between the proportion of women in the occupation and sickness absence is negative. As far as sickness absence is concerned, the gender segregation in the labour market thus seems to work to the advantage of women.

AB Studies on post-World War II housing estates have largely focused on problematic neighbourhoods, and there is a scarcity of literature on housing estates across their entire social scale. Moreover, there is insufficient evidence on the extent to which tenure structure differentiates estates from each other in terms of social disorder. Using a large cluster sample of Finnish estates representing a wide variety of estate neighbourhoods, we examined the implications of tenure structure in terms of social disadvantage and perceived social disorder. We also studied how social interaction and normative regulation mediate the impact of structural estate characteristics. We found that rental domination is associated with social disadvantage, which exposes residents to social disorder, in line with social disorganisation theory. Differences in normative regulation partly explain this association. In contrast, social interaction in the neighbourhood is not associated with the level of perceived social disorder. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.

AB On an individual level, criminal offending is linked to resource deficiencies. Since evictions tend to affect society's weakest groups, we would expect evicted individuals to be convicted of crime to a higher degree than others even before eviction. But is there also a direct effect of eviction on criminal convictions? The aim of this study was to isolate the effect of eviction on criminal convictions. Propensity score matching was used and the analyses included all individuals evicted in Sweden from 2009 to 2010 (n = 5050), and a 10% sample of the adult population (n = 770,000). After matching based on relevant background factors, the analyses showed a significant increase in criminal convictions from the year of eviction until the end of the period studied, two to three years later. The pattern was similar for men and women. Future research should investigate eviction in relation to different types of crime.

AB Sociologists theorize that opportunity beliefs shape whether individuals see their status in society as just or unjust - a topic that is broadly relevant to research linking social structure to emotions and behaviors. Two prominent theories, however, entail competing propositions. The dominant ideology thesis suggests that believing in opportunity barriers increases subjective status injustice, especially for lower class individuals. In contrast, relative deprivation theory implies that believing in restricted opportunities deters upward comparison among the lower classes, potentially reducing class differences in subjective status injustice. Relationships between class position, opportunity beliefs, and subjective status injustice were studied using survey data gathered during the Great Recession in Iceland. The findings indicate that beliefs in opportunity barriers are widespread, yet few see their social status as unjust. Moreover, only opportunity barriers stemming from political ties and gender increase subjective status injustice, especially so in the case of political ties among lower class individuals. It is likely that this latter sentiment was made particularly significant during the recession by an intense moral discourse condemning nepotism and cronyism. Because these two opportunity constraints are widely condemned in Iceland, we suggest that only opportunity barriers defined as social problems in a given society are salient enough to influence status justice evaluations.

AB Frames guide the way in which organizations and individuals interpret their surrounding contexts and shape avenues for thought, action, and behavior. This paper tests the individual-level effects of experiencing frame disputes': the state of holding individual-level frames that are at odds with dominant organizational frames. We hypothesize that on the individual level a frame dispute will be associated with negative effects on outcomes important for an organization's functioning. The hypothesis is tested using a survey of a battalion of Italian soldiers. Our results demonstrate that, on average, soldiers who experienced frame disputes in that they perceived their mission differently from the dominant organizational frame displayed significantly lower levels of perceived cohesion, performance, and legitimacy. Frame disputes are likely to be widespread phenomena among organizations and social movements, and understanding their effects has theoretical, empirical, and policy relevance beyond the military case under study.

AB Using population register data from Norway (n = 209,532) and Sweden (n = 592,491), this study addressed the relationship between partner choice and the timing of first marriage. We considered all migrant-background individuals born between 1972 and 1989 who were either native-born or who immigrated prior to age 18, relative to 10% random samples of the majority populations. The results demonstrate that marital timing patterns of migrant background individuals who married exogamously (that is, with a majority-background spouse or across their global region of origin) were more similar to the majority populations than among those who married endogamously (that is, with another migrant-background individual originating in the same global region). However, among immigrant-background individuals who endogamously married, there was evidence of a shift toward the Scandinavian pattern of later marriage across generations. Taken together the results provide an important starting point for investigations into the family life-courses and social position of children of immigrants in Europe, an increasingly large population subgroup currently entering family formation ages.

AB Ethnic acculturation in a sample of 19-year-old individuals of Yugoslavian and Iranian origin in contemporary Sweden was studied, with a focus on how acculturation is contingent on social structure and social context. Acculturation was measured as orientation to the majority and the parental culture of origin. The results suggest, first, that the two dimensions are weakly but positively correlated, meaning that acculturation identity does not involve any trade-offs, as new strands of oppositional culture theory suggest. Second, it was found that ethnic closure in friendship networks is positively associated with orientations to parents' culture and negatively with orientations to Swedish culture. Individuals with a rich occupational social contact network tended to be orientated towards both the majority and the parental culture. There was a marked social difference between the most disadvantaged social class and all other classes, with the former being less oriented to both cultures compared to more advantaged classes.

AB This article explores gaps in protest engagement between natives and individuals of migrant origin in European cities. It examines migrant-native gaps and second generation-native gaps by associating them with different sources of inequalities: differential individual socio-economic status resources, differential attitudes, and differential characteristics related to migration; differential effects of such factors for natives and for individuals of migrant origin; and differential contexts offering varying opportunities of participation. The study uses cross-national micro-data from a population survey of immigrant-origin individuals and natives in 9 European cities undertaken in 2004-2008. The findings show that observed inequalities in protest participation involving migrants and second generations are largely based on different levels of education attained and of political interest. Some migration-related characteristics, like holding the citizenship of the host country and experienced discrimination, affect protest gaps as well. In addition, results support the claimed importance of the context where individuals of migrant origin settle, in particular, of the characteristics of the citizenship regime. Finally, our findings support a segmented assimilation hypothesis whereby different socio-economic modes of incorporation of ethnic groups in the host cities affect different trajectories of political incorporation.

AB This paper studies the integration of migrant women in six European labour markets, highlighting how their migration penalty is related to the family's migration dynamics and to the husband's occupational condition. In order to compare the labour market outcomes of native and migrant women, Linear Probability Models are estimated using EU-LFS data. Results show that migrant women are penalized everywhere. However, in the Mediterranean labour markets their employment penalty is lower, while the penalty concerning job quality, conditional on employment, is relatively severe. Regarding the role of family migration, results show that: tied-movers women were disadvantaged with respect to both natives and other migrants; those migrants whose partners were unemployed or had low-quality jobs were more likely to find a job than those whose husbands had a good occupational condition. Both patterns were stronger in Mediterranean labour markets.

AB Although ethnic diversity is widely believed to undermine social trust, several scholars have argued that this outcome ultimately depends on the extent of high-quality contacts between diverse groups as well as the extent of equality in society. This article scrutinises these different hypotheses by exploring the association between ethnic diversity and social trust among Swedish schoolchildren. Building on data from Sweden, where legacies of equality would be expected to provide unique opportunities for building trust among diverse groups, the contribution of the article to the literature is twofold. First, it was found that contextual diversity is only weakly related to adolescents' trust. Furthermore, while interactions revealed that a higher socio-economic level in a classroom reinforces, rather than cushions, the adverse effect, it is concluded that contextual measures obscure the micro-level dynamic underlying the association between diversity and trust in classrooms. Second, when accounting for compositional effects, and the distinction between in-group and out-group contact, the findings strongly supported the conflict hypothesis, while rejecting the contact hypothesis. The principal finding is that ethnic diversity in a classroom undermines social trust among native-born adolescents, whereas the effect is the exact opposite for minorities. In addition, social trust is only promoted if adolescents interact with members of their ethnic in-group. Because these disconcerting results were found in the high-trust context of Sweden, it is suggested that similar findings are likely in less favourable settings. The article concludes by arguing that the high levels of social trust in traditionally homogenous, but increasingly segregated, countries such as Sweden may conceal the fact that individuals primarily include others who are similar to themselves in their imagined communities'.

AB During the last 20-30 years Western societies have witnessed large scale migration from the Global South. This has given rise to important challenges in securing the social, civic and political integration of non-Western immigrants into Western societies. Previous research has suggested that participation in volunteering in civil society can serve as a stepping stone' towards integration for immigrants. Whilst the previous studies have shown marked gaps in the propensity to participate in volunteering between immigrants and natives, little work has been done to identify the mechanisms that explain these gaps. In this study, high-quality survey data, linked with data from administrative registers, are used, with the application of logistic regression based on the Karlson-Holm-Breen method to conduct mediation analysis. The mediation analysis shows that non-Western immigrants are significantly less likely to participate in secular volunteering compared to natives; however, over half of this gap is explained by an indirect effect via socio-economic status, self-rated health, generalized trust, informal social networks and the intergenerational transmission of volunteering. Moreover, the mediation analysis suggests that non-Western immigrants are more likely to participate in religious volunteering: this is completely explained by a strong indirect effect occurring via religiosity.

AB Reflexivity theory can contribute in important ways to our understanding of how societies contend with climate change. Avoiding the catastrophic effects of dangerous climate change will require substantial change, yet emissions continue to rise. Social scientific research on climate change mitigation is dominated by a relatively small number of macro-theoretical frameworks, plus a rather large and disparate empirical literature on individual cognitions, attitudes and behaviors. We apply Archer's reflexivity theory to a survey sample drawn from Alberta, Canada, showing that unique predispositions toward reflexivity offer strong predictors of willingness to engage in climate-related mitigative behaviors.

AB Attitudes research shows that the Scandinavian, universal welfare regime receives strong popular support. Why the inhabitants consider this universal model of welfare appropriate is, however, all but unknown. This paper explores the level of welfare attitudes and welfare legitimacy to investigate the cultural standards of worth which justify the universal welfare state to people in Sweden and Denmark. A total of 115 qualitative interviews conducted in Denmark and Sweden in 2013-2014 are analysed to determine and compare the principles of valuation Danes and Swedes employ in evaluating their universal welfare states. Findings include a general cross-country consensus on generalised reciprocity; however, Swedes emphasise security and emancipation, while, in contrast, Danes emphasise societal efficiency and risk pooling.

AB This study investigates social differences in the risk of long-term benefit receipt of young adults in Germany. Although employment is a major route to end social benefit receipt, it may not result in financial independence for all social groups in their early working lives as this also depends on the status of their parents: Do young benefit recipients have unequal chances of making the transition from benefit receipt as soon as they take up employment? How stable is the impact of parents' socioeconomic status on the transition once young adults complete their vocational education? This study conducts an empirical analysis of the careers of a cohort of 18-to-24-year-old Germans who received benefits in 2005 by combining survey data and register data for a six-year observation period. Event history analyses indicate that social differences persist when young adults claim social benefits. In particular, parents' socioeconomic status is positively associated with their offspring's likelihood of ending receipt of social benefits as soon as they are in full-time employment. Parents' socioeconomic status has a relatively stable impact for young beneficiaries irrespective of whether they have completed vocational qualifications or not. The findings suggest that these social differences persist during early working life.

AB This paper provides new evidence of occupational closure and rent-sharing in the labour market. In many labour market segments, occupational closure refers only to self-employed positions, but not to employees within these occupations. We study the relation of changes in entry regulation for firms and the corresponding economic consequences for employees within these firms. Based on bargaining theory, we argue that economic rents are shared with employees. In order to identify this indirect' channel of occupational closure, this paper uses a major reform in the German craft sector in 2004. This reform relaxes entry regulation into self-employment in more than half of the craft occupations. By using rich administrative data in a fixed-effects framework, we compare wages of employees in both markets pre- and post-reform. We find that employees in the reformed market are negatively affected after the reform. This proves the existence of former wage rents due to rent-sharing in closed market segments. This average wage effect, however, is not constant for all employees. If employees can make a credible threat to the employer to take advantage of deregulation and set up their own business, they can counteract the negative wage effects of the reform. As a consequence, our empirical results show that wages of young and skilled employees are less affected by the reform.

AB In this paper, we use register data to examine horizontal stratification within university institutions and university fields of study in Denmark, a country that has experienced a reduction of the social class gap in access to higher education. First, we argue that it is important to use a relatively detailed classification of parents' occupations to determine how students are endowed with different forms of capital, even when their parents would typically be characterised as belonging to the same social group. Second, we distinguish among disciplines and among university institutions to explain the dynamics of horizontal stratification in the Danish university system. Using unique and exhaustive register data, including all higher education institutions and the entire 1984 cohort as of the age of 24, we uncover distinct differences in the magnitude and type of horizontal stratification in different fields of study and university institutions. Most importantly, we find distinct patterns of horizontal stratification by field of study and parental occupation that would have remained hidden had we used more aggregated classifications for field of study and social origin.

AB Using Swedish registry data, we study the chances of mobility into the Swedish labour market elite for men who graduated in the years 1985-2005. The elite is defined as top earners within mid- and large sized firms and within the public sector organisations (henceforth, we use organisation for both firms and public organisations). Using discrete time event history models, we study the incidence of elite entry in terms of external recruitment and internal promotion. The choice of field of study and of college or university are important, as are personality and, to a limited extent, cognitive ability. What is most striking is that having kin in elite positions increases the chance of elite entry in general, and having parents in top positions in the same organisation increases the likelihood of internal promotion. In sum, elite entry among college-educated males is associated with a diversity of factors, suggesting that complex explanations for labour market success should be considered, where skills, personality, and family ties all seem to matter.

AB Compared to natives, students with immigrant background are - other things being equal - more likely to choose academic tracks over vocational education and training (VET) at upper-secondary level. Evidence of so-called ethnic choice effects is mostly based on education systems where vocational tracks are often regarded as unfavourable'. Our study investigated ethnic choice effects at the end of compulsory school in Switzerland, a country with a strong VET sector offering competitive incentives, particularly for students with lower or average achievement. Based on longitudinal data from the Transitions from Education to Employment' (TREE) survey, we found that most migrant groups were more likely to choose academic-track pathways preparing for university admission over VET preparing more directly for employment. Nested logistic regression analyses revealed that a large share of these ethnic choice effects was explained by immigrant optimism. Our findings shed light on general educational decision-making processes among migrant families and their potential consequences for ethnic inequality in post-compulsory education.

AB Research suggests that doctor-patient relations have evolved from a doctor-centered, paternalistic approach towards a more patient-centered, egalitarian model of interactions between physicians and their patients. Given the long-running debate on the positive relationship between education and health, the question arises how this development in doctor-patient relations affects social inequalities in health. First, we test to what extent egalitarian (e.g. discussing treatment decisions with patients) doctor-patient relations are underlying the education-self-reported health association. Second, we test whether egalitarian and paternalistic (e.g. withholding some information from patients) doctor-patient relations show differential effects on self-reported health across educational groups. Analyses of the European Social Survey (ESS) 2004/2005 for 24 countries demonstrate that a more egalitarian doctor-patient relationship does not substantially reduce educational inequalities in self-reported health. However, some direct positive effects of egalitarian and direct negative effects of paternalistic doctor-patient relations on health ratings can be found. Finally, results show how the health status of the lower educated can improve with a more egalitarian and less paternalistic doctor-patient relationship.

AB Populist argumentation claims to represent the people' against the elite', appealing to emotions and reacting to a sense of crisis. By analysing a public debate in Finland in which populist arguments appropriate a culturally shared, familiar experience - that of singing Suvivirsi, the Summer Hymn - I argue that evoking familiarity is an effective way of doing populism'. Analysing media texts from 2002 to 2014 and a questionnaire to political candidates in 2011, and using Laurent Thevenot's sociology of engagements, the article shows that appeals to the familiarity of the hymn are particularly compatible with the populist valorization of the experience of the common people. Familiarity thus constitutes a central tool in the toolkit of populism. Remembering the shared experience of singing the hymn bonds the assumed people' together and gives an emotional charge to populist arguments. By drawing on pragmatist political sociology and analysing politics in action' in everyday disputes, the paper makes a novel contribution to the scholarship of populism.

AB Zygmunt Bauman's sociology of morality signals an important new direction from the orthodoxy of Emile Durkheim's society' realised ethics. The first part of this paper defends Bauman's postmodern position as valuable in theorising the moral present, offering a sociological conception of the sources, strategies and experience of contemporary morality. The paper then shifts to a critique of Bauman's social theory of being for the other', arguing that it misses the particular and embodied aspects of moral sociality and effaces the self in endless responsibility to the Other. It is suggested that a sociology of morality is needed which goes beyond Bauman's moral saint and provides conceptual space to theorise the self and cultures of authenticity and self-fulfilment.

AB Motivations for migrating within the European Union have mainly been attributed to economic, career and lifestyle choices. This article suggests that political dissatisfaction is also an important motivator of recent intra-European migration. In our analysis of in-depth interviews with Romanian migrants in Spain and with Spanish migrants in Norway, we found a common emphasis on the political dimensions of their decision to migrate. In the interviews, the economic component of migration was often related to bad governance and negative perceptions of the state. The similarities of Spanish and Romanian migration narratives are especially striking because Spain and Romania represent substantially different migratory, political and economic contexts. However, migration is more obviously intertwined with conventional acts of political protest in the Spanish case. We suggest that differences in democratic contexts are pivotal in people's reactions to and framing of their deep dissatisfaction with domestic politics, as found in many European countries today.

AB To provide a better understanding of mobile phones as a recruitment tool in collective actions, this study explores the use of mobile phones for mobilizing protest in China. Using in-depth interviews and investigating four cases in which Chinese people employed mobile devices to recruit participants for protests, this study observes that mobile communication in China embodies guanxi, the indigenous social tie in Chinese society that introduces reciprocity as an influential facilitator of collective actions. The embedment of reciprocity facilitates the proliferation of mobilizing calls, legitimizes mobilizing appeals, generates obligations and consolidates solidarity for collective actions. The study concludes with a consideration of the relevance of mobile phones for the embedment of reciprocity in social ties in the mobilization of collective action in authoritarian regimes such as China.

AB Globalization with its many side-effects on working life is seen to pose accentuated risks especially for women and low skilled workers - resulting in increasing polarization of job quality. In contrast to universal theories, institutional theories claim changes in work life might vary according to the institutional and cultural frameworks which mediate the global pressures of change. This study analyses job quality trends in Finland at the intersection of class and gender. The results, based on the Finnish Quality of Work Life survey (1977-2013), find no clear evidence of polarization. In line with the institutional theory's prediction of a low risk of polarization in coordinated and inclusive Nordic countries, improvements have occurred for blue-collar workers in terms of autonomy and opportunities for development at work, reducing the gap between social classes. Furthermore, the negative sides of work life, such as insecurity and time pressures have become common experiences regardless of social class. The welfare state paradox' hypothesis on the comparative disadvantage of women in higher positions in the labour market does not gain support in 2013: the upper-white collar women have attained roughly similar levels of job quality to their male counterparts.

AB This study explores the impact of job security provisions on workplace absence and overtime work. We hypothesize that job security provisions give individuals bargaining power to resolve work hour conflicts in their favour, but they may also create incentives for shirking. To examine the impact of job security provisions empirically, we implement a quasi-experimental research design based on a British job security provisions reform that extended dismissal protection among low-tenure workers. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that the reform increased absence rates due to workers taking more sickness absence and vacation days and reduced overtime work. Regarding the underlying mechanism, we obtain suggestive but limited evidence that the observed effects were driven both by reduced presenteeism and increased shirking.

AB Using the Labour Force Survey 2013, this paper examines gender differences in holding supervisory positions in 26 European countries and relates these differences to horizontal gender segregation, i.e. women and men working in different jobs. First, we confirm the findings of previous studies that women are still disadvantaged in holding supervisory positions in almost all countries. Second, by examining how women's disadvantage varies when working in male-dominated, gender-mixed, and female-dominated occupations, we observe women's lowest disadvantage in male-dominated occupations in most countries. Third, applying a two-stage multilevel analysis, we explore at the macro level how the country variation in women's disadvantage in holding supervisory positions is related to horizontal gender segregation, selection of women in the labour market, and conditions facilitating the combination of work and family, and whether women's disadvantage significantly differs among welfare regimes. We provide evidence that differences among welfare regimes capture much better country variation than single macro indicators.

ID SOCIAL CLOSURE; INEQUALITY; MEMBERSHIP; EARNINGS; NO
AB Recent literature has pointed to occupational closure in order to explain wage inequality between occupations. The basic argument of occupational closure is that average occupational wages are higher in closed occupations because these occupations are better able to establish and maintain institutional barriers to access. In this study we analyse occupational closure and its wage effects in Norway by matching newly gathered occupational data on four different closure institutions (licensure, certifications, unionization, and educational credentials) to register data. The results show strong wage effects of licensure and unionization, net of occupational skill requirements. Our analyses furthermore show substantial differences in the returns to occupational closure across social classes: licensure is especially beneficial for higher classes, whereas unionization generates rents for lower classes, implying that occupational closure affects social inequality in Norway.

DE Collins; collectivity; digital methodology; Durkheim; irony; mediation;

AB The paper seeks to promote a sociological understanding of the current wave of nostalgic expressions haunting late-modern Western culture and to re-evaluate the predominantly negative assessment of nostalgia. Filling two gaps in the existing research on nostalgia, the authors wish (1) to reintegrate into the phenomenon its experiential and collective dimensions and (2) to propose a theoretical sociological framework capable of analysing nostalgic ritual. In the first part of the paper, we discuss different approaches to the phenomenon of nostalgia. Second, we delve into the complex emotional and experiential aspects of the phenomenon and distil three different types of nostalgia. Third, seeking inspiration from Emile Durkheim and Randall Collins, we scrutinise the common collective characteristics of these different types of nostalgia. Arguing that Collins remains too interactionist in his approach to ritual, we seek to erect a theoretical framework apt for articulating mediated forms of nostalgic ritual. Fourth, we use our theoretical framework to analyse a well-known instance of nostalgic ritual in Scandinavia: The Disney Christmas Show.

From the analysis of prime ministers' New Year Addresses between 1940 and 2015, it is evident that the heroification of Danish soldiers has been linked to the elevation of professionalism, self-motivation, individual responsibility, and global outlook as civic virtues since the 1990s. Utilising the concept of a survival unit developed by Norbert Elias, it argues that this elevation is a result of the gradual emergence of competition state' and security state' strategies for protecting the Danish welfare state in the wake of growing international interdependency. On this basis, the paper seeks to contribute to the literature on the social construction of heroes within a theoretical perspective that takes the dynamic relations between states into account, and to explain why specific notions of a hero develop.

AB In current research, the extensive family policies of the Scandinavian countries have been problematized and described as hampering women's careers. However, mechanisms have been little investigated and the Scandinavian countries are often regarded as a single policy model. Based on an account of institutional variety we study gender gaps in hourly wages and access to authority positions in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden and explore the importance of segregation, skills and work interruptions. The analysis uses pooled cross-sectional data from the European Social Survey (ESS) for 2004 and 2010. The results show that gender gaps vary both in size and regarding the mechanisms producing them. In particular, we find that gender segregation has a radically different impact in the four countries. The analysis suggests that the mechanisms linking family policies to labour market outcomes are more complex than envisaged in the current debate and point to the importance of comparing seemingly similar countries.

AB Proposed theories to explain gender inequality in the labor market and family, such as gender specialization within families and gender segregation in the labor markets, lack consideration for individual preferences. Preference theory accounts for individual choice and gendered preferences but has been substantially criticized, indicating a need for further research. This study uses Swedish longitudinal data to explore how preferences for work and family relate to behavior. We explore three critical issues raised in previous research: gender differences in preferences; the relationship between work and family changes and subsequent preferences; how preferences relate to work and family behaviors. Our results showed small general gender differences in preferences, although women had a stronger preference for both children and work than men. Changes in work status were further related to changes in work preferences, while changes in family status were related to changes in family preferences. Moreover, preferences had poor predictive power in relation to work and family behaviors. Our results indicate that preferences do not explain gender inequality in Sweden. The relationship between preferences and behaviors seems bidirectional and preferences and behavior within the family sphere has little to do with preferences and behavior within the work sphere.

AB This article shows that women's rising earnings contributed to reducing inequality in household earnings, with respect to couples. We use data from the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) on 1,148,762 coupled households, covering 18 OECD countries and the period from 1973 to 2013. In this period, women's share of household earnings grew, spouses' earnings became more strongly and positively correlated in various countries, and inequality in women's earnings was reduced. Inequality in household earnings increased due to the rising correlation between spouses' earnings, but was reduced more by the decline of inequality in women's earnings. Had women's earnings remained unchanged since the 1970s and 1980s, inequality in household earnings would have been higher around 2010 in all observed OECD countries. Household inequality was reduced least by trends in women's earnings in countries with a long history of high female labor-force participation, such as Finland (3% reduction) and Sweden (5%), and most in countries that observed a stronger increase in female labor-force participation in recent decades such as Spain (31%) and the Netherlands (41%). As more countries are reaching a plateau in the growth of women's employment and earnings, the potential for further stimulating women's employment and earnings to counter both women's and household inequality seems to be increasingly limited.

AB Major social changes such as occupational restructuring, educational expansion and increasing income inequality are likely to significantly influence the intergenerational transmission of income. The aim in this article is to investigate this question in an analysis of the transmission of low and high income in Finland in five birth cohorts born between 1956 and 1978. The focus is on the contribution of parental social class and personal educational level to this association. The analyses are based on a longitudinal register-based data set that is a representative 11-per-cent sample of the Finnish population. The level of intergenerational income transmission among those with a low- and a high-income parental background is stable among men, and is increasing slightly among women. Simultaneously, the role of achieved education as a mechanism strengthens slightly upon entry to the lowest income level, and declines upon entry to the highest level. These results indicate that despite the increasing income inequality, intergenerational transmission remains rather stable, but the mediating role of educational qualifications may have changed. Occupational restructuring seems to have no clear influence on the process.

AB In this study we examine the extent to which preschool education can reduce social background differentials in learning outcomes across countries; our focus is on whether the benefits of preschool attendance for children depend on other family inputs such as parents' education and their pedagogical involvement during early childhood. We use the 2011 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study, which provides a standardized measure of reading literacy among students in 4th grade. Our sample contains data on 119,008 individuals from 28 developed countries. The presented evidence confirms that preschool is visibly beneficial in most cases, but also that benefits are lower for children who have more involved or more educated parents. Rather than complements to, parental involvement and parental education seem to be substitutes for preschool attendance in children's skill production function. As such, preschool education reduces social inequalities in educational achievement. Yet, its equalizing potential could have been overstated in previous debates.

DE Citizenship; justification; subject position; modalities; welfare state;

ID GOVERNMENTALITY; DISCOURSE; CARE
AB Foucault's work has inspired studies examining how subject positions are constructed for citizens of the welfare state that encourage them to adopt the subject position of active and responsible people or consumers. Yet these studies are often criticised for analysing these subject positions as coherent constructions without considering how their construction varies from one situation to another. This paper develops the concept of subject position in relation to the theory of justification and the concept of modality in order to achieve a more sensitive and nuanced analysis of the politics of welfare in public debates. The theory of justification places greater weight on actors' competence in social situations. It helps to reveal how justifications and critiques of welfare policies are based on the skilful contextual combination of diverse normative bases. The concept of modality, in turn, makes it possible to elaborate how subject positions in justifications and critiques of welfare policies become associated with specific kinds of values. We demonstrate the approach by using public debates on children's day care in Finland. The analysis illustrates how subject positions are justified in relation to different kinds of worlds and made persuasive by connecting them to commonly desirable rights, responsibilities, competences or abilities.

AB Sympathy is an emotion that connects people in trouble with those around them. This paper uses Candace Clark's sociological theory on sympathy-giving to explore the emotional relationships between adult children of alcoholics (ACOAs) and their parents. Three dimensions are singled out as being central to sympathy-giving. We show, first, that the sympathy accounts' of alcoholic parents are related to the degree to which they live up to standardized parental obligations. Second, ACOAs' sympathy investment in their parents is associated with the parents' reciprocation - in terms of returning the sympathy, showing gratitude and/or acknowledging their problems and trying to solve them. Third, the interviewees' sympathy-giving is related to the moral status they ascribe to problem drinkers, and especially their conceptions of alcohol problems as being self-inflicted or caused by circumstances the drinker cannot control. The paper is based on qualitative interviews with 25 ACOAs recruited through a survey in Denmark.
